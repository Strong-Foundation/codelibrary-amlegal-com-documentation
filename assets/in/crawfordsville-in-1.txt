§ 32.02 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Under the circumstances hereinafter set out, the city does hereby
agree to hold harmless and indemnify all elected officials and employees from
any and all liability that may arise out of and in the course of the
performance of the duties of such elected officials and employees for and on
behalf of the city.
   (B)   Such agreement of indemnification shall extend not only to the payment
of money judgments and compensatory damages, but also to punitive damages,
attorney fees, miscellaneous costs of defense and the like.
   (C)   As a condition of this indemnification agreement and its validity for
the benefit of the elected officials and employees, the city reserves the right
to choose and select the attorney to provide the defense against any such claim
for damages on behalf of the elected official, appointed official or employee
to be indemnified; further that, nothing herein contained shall prevent the
elected official, appointed official or employee from securing counsel of his
own choosing, but he or she shall do so at his or her own expense.
   (D)   This agreement of indemnification shall extend to and for the benefit
of each elected official, appointed official and employee of the town so long
as the claim or lawsuit presented or filed against such elected official,
appointed official or employee shall arise out of and in the course of the
performance of official duties on behalf of the city by the elected official,
appointed official or employee, and at the time of the committing of the
alleged acts, such elected official, appointed official or employee shall in
good faith believe he or she acted within the scope of his or her authority on
behalf of the city and consistent with the policy thereof. Even though acts
alleged to have been committed by the elected official, appointed official or
employee may constitute a violation of IC Chapter 35, this shall not act as an
absolute bar to the effectiveness of this indemnification agreement, but if
such acts are proven to be a violation of IC Chapter 35, that shall be prima
facie evidence that such elected official, appointed official or employee was
not acting in good faith within the scope of his or her duties and
responsibilities for the city, which is, of course, rebuttable by the elected
official, appointed official or employee.
   (E)   If an elected official, appointed official or employee shall be
required to employ an attorney or incur other litigation expenses in the course
of successfully securing an indemnification hereunder, the city shall further

§ 32.08 NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT BY A RELATIVE POLICIES ADOPTED.
   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and in
contracting with the city in order to continue to be able to provide local

July 1, 2012 known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.

more detailed are necessary.
   (F)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he or she will
not be in the direct line of supervision. See IC 36-4-6-11 and IC 36-5-2-9.4.
   (G)   The city finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the city cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.

hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.

implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the nepotism policy or the contracting with a unit by a relative policy may be
subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the contracting with a unit by a relative
policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of either the nepotism policy or
the contracting with a unit by a relative policy may be subject to action
allowed by law.

(Res. 15-2012, passed 6-11-12)
§ 32.09 DRUG FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Overview. The City of Crawfordsville, Indiana makes a commitment to
provide employees a safe working environment, to ensure that employees,
equipment and operating practices comply with health and safety standards, and
to maintain public confidence in the city and its employees. Since the city
values each employee, the city offers employees assistance in dealing with
alcohol and drug abuse problems.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   The city requires all employees to report for work in a condition
that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol or with
prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
      (2)   Violation of any provision of this section will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action
up to and including discharge.
      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by the city at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws or
to better serve the needs of the city.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
8120 and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. 1308.11-1308.15) and
prescription controlled substance which have not been prescribed by a licensed
physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the employee. Abuse of
prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be treated as a substance
abuse problem under this section.
      (2)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other
controlled substances while on the job or on city premises (including vehicles
used for city business). These include but are not limited to marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over
to the state police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on city premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off city premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for city business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on city
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized, official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for city business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this section and report any conviction to the city under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off city premises when conducting city
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the city within five business
days after the conviction. The city will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source.
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this section. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the city will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any adverse
effect the employee's actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the city's reputation and image.
      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be
directed to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual's responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the city will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol or drug-related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this section or any other city policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline.)
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The city may conduct random alcohol or drug tests at any time with
or without cause or suspicion to assure compliance with its drug-free workplace
policy.
      (2)   Alcohol or drug tests may be required for employees in the
following circumstances:
         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior
is reasonably indicative of substance abuse.
         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol
rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the
city.
         (c)   When required by law.
      (3)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
city. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
      (4)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the city. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

times and on the same terms as taxes are now due and become delinquent and the

(Ord. 6-2022, passed 4-11-22)
§ 37.18 CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   General information.
      (1)   The fixed asset policy is being issued retroactive effective
January 1, 2018. The new policy will be referred to as the capital asset
policy. This policy is being issued to document the minimum value of capital
assets to be reported on our financial reports and to include infrastructure
assets. This issuance of a policy document is related to the implementation of
a new reporting model, Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34.
Statement 34 will require the city to depreciate capital assets. The capital
asset threshold will be $25,000. An asset with a value under $25,000 will be
expensed in the year of purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy is
also effective January 1, 2007.
      (2)   City stormwater utility will follow this same definition of capital
assets except any item with a unit cost of $25,000 or more shall be
capitalized. Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $25,000) are
expensed in the year of acquisition. City stormwater utility will follow the
capitalization guidelines of the Indiana State Board of Accounts.
      (3)   The City of Crawfordsville is, by this subchapter, establishing a
capital asset policy in order to provide a higher degree of control over its
considerable investment in capital assets, and to be able to demonstrate
accountability to its various constituencies: citizens, rate-payers, oversight
bodies and regulators. All public information pertaining to capital assets will
be made available in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).
      (4)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold:
         (a)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of Crawfordsville;
         (b)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
         (c)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement policies;
         (d)   To provide data for financial reporting; and
         (e)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
      (5)   This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board of Accounts. It does not include data processing,
programming requirements, or computer operations procedures.
   (B)   Definition of capital assets.
      (1)   Capital assets include land, land improvements, including
monuments, buildings, building improvements, construction in progress,
machinery and equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be
capitalized but not depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one
year, and having a unit cost of $25,000 or more shall be capitalized (including
acquisitions by lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset
meeting the criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government-wide
financial statements.
      (2)   Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $25,000) are
expensed in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers
and other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than $25,000. See Section E
below.
      (3)   Exceptions:
         (a)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
         (b)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units; and
         (c)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added
subsequent to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place
and adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized. Purchases made using grant funds
must comply with grant requirements or the above procedures, whichever are the
most restrictive.
      (4)   Threshold level for capital assets. The following schedule will be
followed for the different types of capital assets other than infrastructure
assets:
 Capitalize/Depreciate
                         Capitalize/Depreciate
Building                 $25,000>
Building improvements    $25,000>
Construction in progress All/capitalize only
Land                     All/capitalize only
Land improvements        $25,000>
Machinery and equipment  $25,000>
Vehicle                  $25,000>
 
   (C)   Asset definitions by major category.
      (1)   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each
asset category be precisely defined and that all persons are responsible for
records maintenance are fully aware of the categorization system. This section
further clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
         (a)   LAND. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or
acreage including rights-of-way, owned by the City of Crawfordsville, its
various departments, boards or authorities, regardless of the method or date of
acquisition. Easements will not be included as the city does not own them, but
as an interest in land owned by another (i.e. property owner) that entitles its
holder to a specified limited use.
         (b)   Improvements other than buildings.
            1.   Examples of city assets in this category are walks, parking
areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters,
undergrounds sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
            2.   Examples of city stormwater utility assets in this category
are storm sewers, dams, fences, intake pipes, and manholes.
         (c)   Buildings.
            1.   All structures designed and erected to house equipment,
services, or functions are included. This includes systems, services, and
fixtures within the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire
escapes, canopies, areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such
units that serve the building.
            2.   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling,
ventilating and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems,
surveillance systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed
equipment are included with the building, if owned.
            3.   Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as
buildings. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
         (d)   Equipment.
            1.   Equipment includes all other types of physical property within
the scope of the fixed asset management system not previously classified.
Included within this category is office mechanical equipment, office furniture,
appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication
equipment, police, fire, sanitation and part department, laboratory equipment,
vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency equipment, earth moving
equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment, and data processing
equipment. All supplies are excluded, of years than most capital and that are
normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads, streetlights, traffic
signals, drainage systems, and water systems. Infrastructure assets do not
include buildings, drives, parking lots or any other examples given above that
are incidental to property or access to the property above.
            2.   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase
the capacity of efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/
repairs will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and
therefore not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal,
etc., are considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also, normal
department operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary
engineering and design, and will be expensed and not capitalized as an element
of the infrastructure asset.
            3.   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: Existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the city is responsible only for the maintenance, such as patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the city will not track and value alleys, and the
patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
      (2)   Retroactive asset reporting. The retroactive reporting requirements
for infrastructure of GASB 34 requires the city to report items put into
service from 1980 forward, and gives the city the option to report items put
into service prior to 1980. The city will report only on items put into service
after 1980.
   (D)   Depreciation methods.
      (1)   The city will be depreciating capital assets by using the straight-
line method. Salvage value will be determined on an asset-by-asset basis.
Depreciation will be calculated at fiscal year-end. Land in not depreciated
according to general accepted accounting principles.
      (2)   A network of assets is composed of all assets that provide a
particular type of service for government. A subsystem of a network of assets
in composed of all assets that make a similar portion or segment of a network
of assets. The following will be the breakdown of our networks and subsystems:
 
Roads/streets network                 
                          Subsystems Types of streets
                                    Curbs and gutters
Traffic components network            
                          Subsystems Traffic signals (controls, loop
                                      detectors, and sensors)
                                    Street lights
 
      (3)   Straight-line depreciation. All assets accounted for under the
capital asset policy will be depreciated using the straight-line method of
depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded. Following is a list
of the most common useful lives:
Item Description Useful Life
Item Description                            Useful Life
Armored vehicles                            15 years
Building components (HVAC systems, roofing) 20 years
Buildings                                   50 years
Computer hardware                        3 years
Computer software                        5 years
Fire trucks (apparatus, pumper)             15 years
Flood walls/gates                           50 years

fencing)
Land improvements - structure (parking      20 years
lots, athletic courts, swimming pools
Leasehold improvements                      Useful life of asset or lease term
                                            (whichever is shorter)
Office furniture                            20 years
Outdoor equipment (playground equipment,    15 years
radio towers)
Roads                                     
Asphaltic concrete                          20 years
Brick or stone                              50 years
Portland cement concrete                    30 years
Gravel                                   15 years
Street lights                               35 years
Traffic signals                             25 years
Vehicles                                    5 years
 
   (E)   Capital asset acquisitions.
      (1)   The method of acquisition is not a determining factor. Each
department should report items acquired by:
         (a)   Regular purchases;
         (b)   Lease purchase - see below;
         (c)   Construction by city personnel;
         (d)   Construction by an outside contractor;
         (e)   Resolution/condemnation;
         (f)   Donation/contribution;
         (g)   Addition to an existing asset;
         (h)   Transfer from another department;
         (i)   Trade or barter; and
         (j)   Annexation.
      (2)   Leased equipment should be capitalized if the lease agreement meets
any one of the following criteria:
         (a)   The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by
the end of the lease term;
         (b)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option;
         (c)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property; or
         (d)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease, excluding executory costs, equals at least 90% of the fair value
of the leased property.
      (3)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be
recorded as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial
statements.
   (F)   Asset transfers and dispositions.
      (1)   Property should not be transferred, turned-in for auction, or
disposed of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment
outprocessing checklist should be sent to the City Clerk-Treasurer's Office in
all cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any
movements of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account,
department, building, floor or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
      (2)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
         (a)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset's tag number or city ID;
         (b)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries;
         (c)   Write legibly;
         (d)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form;
         (e)   Enter information in correct row, depending onwhether you are
transferring or deleting an asset;
      (3)   If an asset is stolen, the department should notify the Safety
Manager as well as the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
   (G)   Periodic inventories. A physical inventory of all capital assets (any
item over $25,000) will be conducted in each department on or about December 31
of every year. The City Clerk-Treasurer's office will conduct spot checks on a
random basis. Department heads will be accountable for the capital asset
inventory charged to their departments by verifying a list of their capital
assets at year-end.
   (H)   Responsibilities of Clerk-Treasurer's office. The Fiscal Officer will
ensure that accounting for capital assets is being exercised by establishing a
capital asset inventory, both initially and periodically in subsequent years.
The Fiscal Officer will further ensure that the capital asset report will be
updated annually to reflect additions, retirements, and transfers and to
reflect the new, annual capital asset balance for financial reporting purposes
and the annual and accumulated depreciation calculation.
   (I)   Responsibilities of department heads.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the department head to act as or
designate a steward for each piece of property. The steward will become the
focal point for questions regarding the availability, condition, and usage of
the asset, as well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
      (2)   The steward shall be designated as the person to record the receipt
of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure that no damage was incurred
during shipment and to make sure that the asset was received in working order.
      (3)   The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary
preventative maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working
condition. It is necessary to have a responsible person available for questions
that arise during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the
asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it
was acquired and there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition, the
steward should report any property damage or theft.

installing associated electrical equipment for a fee shall first apply to the
manager for authorization to engage in the business. No such person or employer
of him or such firm or corporation shall engage in such work without first
passing a written standard examination under supervision of the Utility. Upon
the applicant showing that such person engaging in such work has satisfactorily
passed such examination, the Manager shall issue permission for the Clerk-
Treasurer to issue the applicant a license authorizing him to engage in such
business. There shall be two types of such license.
   (A)   A Class A license shall entitle the holder thereof to install or
repair, or contract to install or repair, electrical wiring and related
equipment used within or on buildings or appurtenances thereto, for the
distribution of electrical energy within or on the buildings or appurtenances,
subject to the provisions of the Electric Code of the city and the National
Electrical Code for the year 1984.
   (B)   A Class B limited license shall entitle the owner thereof, to install
and repair, or contract to install and repair, electrical wiring from the
service entrance or other suitable disconnecting device to and on electrical
equipment furnished and installed by the holder of a Class B limited license
and does not entitle the holder thereof to do other electrical wiring in the
building where such equipment is installed. Permits for Class B limited license
shall be limited to wiring of branch circuits of 20 amperes or less.
(‘85 Code, § 24.03(a))
§ 50.21 EXAMINATION.
   The Manager shall establish the examination for applicants and determine a
passing standard, and the Manager may periodically revise the examination for
the purpose of maintaining it in accordance with modern electrical wiring
standards. The Utility Board may establish a reasonable examination fee. Upon
successful completion of the examination, the Manager shall issue a certificate
authorizing such persons to engage in electrical work provided such work is
done under authority of the appropriate license.
(‘85 Code, § 24.03(b))
§ 50.22 FEE.
   The fee for a Class A license issued under this chapter is $100 for the
first year or fractional part thereof, and $50 for renewal for each successive
year thereafter. The fee for a Class B license issued under this chapter is $50
for the first year or fractional part thereof, and $25 for renewal for each
successive year thereafter. All licenses expire December 31 of each year and
such fee shall be paid to the City Clerk-Treasurer in advance before any
license shall be issued. A license will be considered to have lapsed if the
renewal fee is not received by March 30 of the year succeeding that in which
the license expires. All electrical licenses in effect at any time shall
continue in effect upon payment of the license fees and re-examination is not
required.

the City Electrician or competent person delegated by him, a written permit
therefor, and no installation in any building possessing no electrical
installations or wiring shall be made without first securing written permission
therefor. The City Electrician may require a written description or diagram of
such wiring before such permit is issued.
(‘85 Code, § 24.04(a))
§ 50.24 INSPECTION.
   No work shall be done before the permit is issued, and upon the completion
of the electrical work and before any portion of the work is hidden from view
by permanent installations of other material, the person shall submit such work
for inspection and approval of the City Electrician. If such electrical work is
not approved, it shall be corrected or destroyed within a reasonable time as
determined by the City Electrician. If approved by him, the City Electrician
shall issue a certificate of satisfactory inspection which shall contain the
date of inspection and an outline of the result of such examination. No
certificate shall be issued unless all apparatus, wires, etc., connected
therewith are set in conformity with the rules and regulations applicable
thereto; nor shall any current be turned on until such certificate is issued.
The Electrical Contractor or his designated representative, and the Electrical
Inspector shall be present at the location of the work for the preliminary and
final inspections. The City Electrician shall keep a full and complete daily
record of all work done, permits issued, examinations made or other official
work performed, as required by this chapter.
(‘85 Code, § 24.04(b))
§ 50.25 ACCESS TO PROPERTY.
   The City Electrician or other competent person delegated by him shall have
the right during reasonable hours to enter any building or premises in the
discharge of his official duties, or for the purpose of making any test of any
electrical apparatus or appliances therein contained, and for this purpose he
shall be given prompt access to all buildings and premises private or public,
by the person owning or in charge or control of the same. The Chief of the Fire
Department or the City Electrician or competent person delegated by either of
them, shall have the power to cause the removal of all wires or the turning off
of all electrical current where the circuits interfere with the work of the
Fire Department or endanger life or property.
(‘85 Code, § 24.05)
§ 50.26 ELECTRICAL UTILITY EXCEPTION.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or organization employing personnel engaged
primarily in the business of stringing electrical wires, installing associated
electrical work on its own property only, may upon written permission of the
City Electrician be excepted from the provisions of §§
50.20 through
50.24 and shall, upon written request of the City Electrician, submit a report
summarizing the electrical work to be contemplated or completed by such person,
firm, or organization.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to persons,
firms, or organization engaged in the business of stringing wires and/or
installing associated electrical equipment primarily for communication purposes
in which cases the frequencies are normally above 1,000 cycles per second.
(‘85 Code, § 24.06)
§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of this chapter or failing to comply with
any rules and provisions which may be established by virtue of powers invested
by this chapter, or failing to comply with an order of the City Electrician
made by virtue of the powers conferred on him by this chapter, may be removed
from the electric service of the city’s electric plant and/or be fined in any
sum not less than $10 nor more than $100. Upon a second conviction, the City

51.99
§ 51.03 MUNICIPAL WASTE REMOVAL.
   (A)   Residential municipal waste in the city shall be collected and
disposed of by the Sanitation Department. Non-residential municipal waste and
waste other than municipal waste must be disposed of by other lawful means.
   (B)   Subject to the exceptions listed below, the Sanitation Department
shall collect residential municipal waste once each week at each residence of
the city, by regular weekly routes. The Sanitation Department shall provide to
any person who requests it a schedule of its collection and a map showing which
area of the city will receive collection service each day of the week, Monday
through Friday, except when collection is to occur during holidays or when
events beyond the Department’s control, such as weather or breakdown of
equipment, prevent collection. In such event, residences will receive
collection service by the Sanitation Department the next available day. If a
street is the boundary line between collection days, the residences on opposite
sides of the street may receive collection services on different days of the
week. Collection maps and schedules shall be made available to the public at
the Sanitation Department office and at the City Building.
   (C)   Large items may be collected from residences from time to time by the
city separately from municipal waste, pursuant to a program to be managed by
the Sanitation Department. There shall be a fee of $25 paid to the city for
every large item pickup at a residence. Before being placed for collection, all
items must be appropriately decommissioned and/or secured. Nothing in this
chapter shall obligate the city to pick up large items, and any item that is
capable of being placed in a trash bag approved for collection pursuant to this
chapter will not be collected, whether it is placed in a larger container or
otherwise.
   (D)   All garbage must be drained and placed in sealed bags. Broken glass
and sharp or piercing objects must be wrapped heavily with newspaper or other
padding in such a manner as to prevent rupturing any bag and possibly injuring
collection personnel or others. Syringes and/or needles shall be placed in a
solid container with a tight fitting lid so as not to puncture any containers.
Flammable and explosive materials, including ammunition, are not municipal
waste and are prohibited from being placed for collection by the city.
   (E)   All residential municipal waste must be placed in trash bags that
comply with the requirements of this chapter. Trash bags shall not exceed 33
gallons in size and shall not exceed 40 pounds in weight when filled and shall
be securely tied or crimped. One or more of those bags may then be placed in
trash cans or bins or other appropriate containers to protect the bags from
animals or the elements. Containers shall be made of such material intended for
garbage or trash storage. A bag will not be collected if it is frozen to a
container or if the bag or container is frozen to the ground, or if the bag is
so weak or torn that it cannot be lifted into the trash truck without the
likelihood of the bag breaking. Cardboard boxes are not approved containers.
   (F)   Containers and bags shall not be overfilled so that any contents fall
out when handled. Residents shall be responsible for promptly cleaning up any
municipal waste that falls due to ripped, weak or overfilled bags, or due to
the resident’s failure to properly secure a lid or container.
   (G)   Containers and bags shall be placed at a visible and accessible place
on the resident’s property within five feet of an alley if the alley is in use,
or if the alley is not in use, then at an easily accessible and visible spot on
the resident’s property within five feet of the curb or street pavement. A
resident who is unable to place containers or hags at such locations shall
contact the Sanitation Department to make acceptable arrangements for
placement.

prior to 5:00 p.m. on the day preceding collection, nor later than 7:30 a.m. on
the day of collection. Trash cans and bins may not be left at the location
required by division (G) above, before 5:00 p.m. on the day preceding
collection, regardless of whether they are empty or not. Persons allowing bags,
cans, bins or other receptacles that are not picked up for any reason to remain
in the location required by division (G) above, after 7:30 a.m. on the day
after collection shall be liable under the city’s nuisance ordinance for
allowing them to remain there.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE.
   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the city
and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resultant sludge;
   (B)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the system; and
   (C)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludges from the system.
(‘85 Code, § 9.01)
§ 52.002 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Unless otherwise defined herein, terms shall be as adopted in the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,
published by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation. Waste constituents and
characteristics shall be measured by Standard Methods unless a mutually agreed
upon acceptable alternative method is adopted between the concerned parties, or
as established by state or federal regulatory agencies. Monitoring shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods. For the purpose of this chapter,
the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
   ACT. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (PL92-500) as amended by the
Clean Water Act (PL 95-217) of 1977.
   APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARD. Any pretreatment limit or prohibitive
standard (federal, state and/or local) contained in this chapter and considered

   NEW SOURCE.
      (1)   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there
is (or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced
after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under § 307(c) of the
Act that will be applicable to such source if such Standards are thereafter
promulgated in accordance with that section, provided, that:
         (a)   The building, structure, facility, or installation is
constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or
         (b)   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally
replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an existing source; or
         (c)   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of
an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such the extent to which the new facility is
integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is
engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should be
considered.
      (2)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a NEW SOURCE if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of division (l)(b) or (c) above but otherwise alters, replaces, or
adds to existing process or production equipment.
      (3)   Construction of a NEW SOURCE as defined herein has commenced if the

§ 52.129 PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with the most stringent of this subchapter, federal
pretreatment standard, as established by 40 CFR Chapter I, Subpart N, State
standards and permit conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all national
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations, as specified by
the federal pretreatment regulations, and with any other pretreatment standards
by applicable deadlines.
   (B)   Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the industrial user’s expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the POTW for review, and shall be approved by the POTW before construction
of the facility. The review and approval of plans and operating procedures does
not relieve the industrial user from complying with the provisions of this
subchapter and permit conditions. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and approved by the POTW
prior to the industrial user’s initiation of the changes.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Department Head
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in. 40
CFR 403.6(e).
   (D)   The Department Head is authorized to establish and enforce specific
limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). These limits shall continue to be
developed, as necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with the
POTW’s NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices. Specific effluent
limits shall not be developed or enforced, without individual notice to persons
or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to respond.
   (E)   Where specific prohibitions or limits on pollutants or pollutant
parameters are developed by a POTW, as stated above, such limits shall be
deemed local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of § 307(d) of
the Act.
   (F)   The pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through
and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in
excess of the limits stated in §
52.128(B)(10). The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
total metal unless indicated otherwise. The department head may impose mass
limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above. The city
or Department Head may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
specific limits and the requirements of §
52.128. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards
for the purposes of § 307(d) of the Act.
   (G)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Department Head, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Department Head and shall
be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at their
expense.
   (H)   Hauled wastewater. Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW
only at locations designated by the Department Head and at such times as are
established by the Department Head. Such waste shall not violate §
52.128 or any other requirements established by the Department Head or city.
The Department Head may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits.
   (I)   The Department Head may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits. The Department Head may require
generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge
permits. The Department Head also may prohibit the disposal of hauled
industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all
other requirements of this subchapter.
   (J)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Department Head. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Department Head. The Department Head may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The Department Head
may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
   (K)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

§ 52.131 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   No statement contained in this ordinance shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial user. Furthermore, no special agreement or arrangement shall allow
any industrial user to discharge metals in excess of the maximum allowable
headworks loading (MAHL) of the POTW or conventional pollutants, which will
exceed the POTW’s designed capacity.
   (B)   Also, The Department Head may impose mass limitations in addition to,
or in place of, any local limit established by this ordinance. The mass limits
shall not allow any industrial user to discharge metals in excess of the
maximum allowable headworks loading (MARL) of the POTW or conventional
pollutants, which will exceed, the POTW’s designed capacity. Furthermore, the
mass limit shall not be less stringent than federal or state requirements.
(Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-13-12; Am. Ord. 15-2016, passed 7-11-16)
§ 52.132 DILUTION PROHIBITION.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement, no industrial user shall increase the use of process
water or in any way dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with any pretreatment standard or
requirement. The control authority (as defined in 403.12(a)) may impose mass
limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.

§ 52.133 SPILL PREVENTION AND SLUG CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   Industrial users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
materials which may interfere with the POTW by developing spill prevention
plans. Facilities necessary to implement these plans shall be provided and
maintained at the owner’s or industrial user’s expense. Spill prevention plans,
including the facilities and the operation procedures, shall be approved by the
POTW before construction of the facility.
   (B)   Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not contribute
to the POTW after the effective date of this subchapter unless a spill
prevention plan has been approved by the POTW. Approval of such plans shall not
relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations
governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances.
   (C)   The POTW shall evaluate each significant industrial user at least once
every two years and other industrial users as necessary, to determine whether
such user needs a plan to control slug discharges. If the POTW decides that a
slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the
following elements:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under §
52.128, with procedures for follow up written notification within five days;
      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment,
measures for containment of toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), or
measures and equipment for emergency response, or both.

conditions, and in the case of any discharge that could cause problems to the
POTW including any slug loadings, as defined by §
52.127 of this subchapter, the industrial user shall immediately notify the
POTW of the discharge by telephone. The notification shall include:
      (1)   The date, time, location and duration of the discharge;
      (2)   The type of waste, including concentration and volume;
      (3)   Any corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such a discharge the user shall submit a
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures that will
be taken by the user to prevent similar future discharges.
   (C)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or their liability resulting from the discharge, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
applicable state of federal laws.
   (D)   Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users must promptly
notify the Department Head in advance of any substantial change in the volume
or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted

shall submit baseline reports to the POTW in a form prescribed and furnished by
the POTW. The report may utilize data only, so long as the data provides
information, sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
   (B)   Within 180 days after the effective date of the national categorical
pretreatment standard, or 180 days after a final administrative decision has
been made upon a categorical determination submission in accordance with 40 CFR
§ 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, industrial users which are existing sources
subject to such national categorical pretreatment standards and currently
discharge to the POTW shall submit a properly completed baseline report.
   (C)   Under 40 CFR Part 403.12(b), new sources, and sources that become
categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the designated city official at least ninety 90 days
before commencement of their discharging, a report which contains the
information contained in 40 CFR part 403.12 (b)(l)-(5). In addition, the report
should indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and method of analysis.
The report shall certify that sampling and. analysis represents normal work
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. The sampling and analysis
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new
source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.
   (D)   In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall submit,
in units and terms specified in the application, the following information:
      (1)   Name and address of the facility including the name of operator and
owner;
      (2)   List of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility;
      (3)   Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and
standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
      (4)   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow, in gallon per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e);
      (5)   The industrial user shall identify the national categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall:
         (a)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in. the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. This portion
of the baseline report must also include concentrations or masses of
pollutants, or both, as appropriate, as well as documentation of BMP
implementation that may be requires as part of the local limits. See 403.12(b)
(5)(h);
         (b)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, 24 hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control
authority may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial
user that demonstrates the flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such
cases samples may be obtained through time proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged;
         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this division;
         (d)   Samples should, be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated, wastewater prior to Pretreatment the user should measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of § 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. When an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated,
in accordance with § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data
shall be submitted to the POTW;
      (6)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards,
prohibited discharge standards, local limits, and state and local law are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional pretreatment or O&M
is required for the industrial user to meet the national categorical
pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law;
      (7)   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will develop
and submit a compliance schedule for selection and installation of adequate
technology and equipment. The industrial user will provide the shortest
schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M by the
compliance date established for the applicable national categorical
pretreatment standard.

formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (§
403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by division (D)(7)(b)
of this section, the information required by §
52.175(D)(6) and (7) shall pertain to the modified limits.
         (b)   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as
a response to divisions (D)(6 ) and (7) of this section and submit them to the

§ 52.176 COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
control authority a report containing the information described, in §
52.175(D)(4) through (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with
the procedures in § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of
the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. The report must state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards, this statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified
professional.

§ 52.177 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the POTW
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the Department Head, a report indicating the nature
and concentration, of pollutants in The effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. This report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during
the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in §
52.175(D)(4) through (6). At the discretion of the Department Head and in
consideration of such factors as local high flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, and the like, the Department Head may agree to alter the months during
which above reports are to be submitted. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention, alternative, the user must submit documentation required by POTW or
the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the
user.
   (B)   The POTW may impose mass limitations on users that are using dilution
to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate, hi such cases, the
report required by division (A) of this section must indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall, contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and mass where requested, by the Department Head, of pollutants contained,
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
   (C)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the POTW in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6 (c), the report required by §
52.171 shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production
rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report
required by §
52.171 shall include the User’s actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
   (D)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Department Head, the user must include all
monitoring data and results in the report.
   (E)   Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the POTW
at least once every six months (on dates specified by the control authority) a
description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required
to be reported by the control authority.
   (F)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.

§ 52.178 MONITORING AND ANALYSIS IN SUPPORT OF SELF-MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The reports required by this ordinance or 40 CFR 403.12, or both, must
be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the
report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other persons, approved by the Administrator. This sampling and analysis may
be performed by the POTW in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW itself
collects all the information required for the report, the significant
industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
   (B)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicated a violation, the
user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of a becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the report analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if:
      (1)   The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or
      (2)   The POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
   (C)   The reports required in §
52.177(A) and (D) shall be based upon data, obtained, through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which
data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
POTW shall require the frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure
compliance by Industrial Users with applicable pretreatment standards, and
requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-
hour composite samples must be obtained, through flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Department Head. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Department Head, the
samples must be representative of the Discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that
facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified, in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a. 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Department Head as
appropriate.
   (D)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
52.175 and
52.176, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the POTW may authorize a lower minimum.
For the reports §
52.177 require, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
   (E)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in §§
52.175 through
52.177 monitors the pollutants more recently than required by the POTW, using
the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
   (F)   Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports
required by section §§
52.175,
52.176,
52.177,
52.179, and
52.180 must include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)
(2)(h), and be signed by an authorized representative.

§ 52.179 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Each user must notify the Department Head of any significant changes to the
user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater at least 180 days before the change.
   (A)   The Department Head may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52.155.
   (B)   The Department Head may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit or modify or revoke and reissue or terminate an existing wastewater
discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.

§ 52.180 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a. Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Department Head of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and. volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Department Head, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Department
Head immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a
slug discharge.

§ 52.181 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user
under 40 CFR § 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit: the following certification
statement, signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in §
52.127(C). This certification must accompany any alternative report required by
the control authority:
      Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40
CFR               , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that
during the period from                            ,
to                           ,                         [month, days, year]:
      (a)   The facility described as                       [facility name] met
the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described in
§ 403.3(v)(2);
      (b)   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements during this reporting period; and
      (c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. This
compliance certification is based upon, the following information:
(Ord. 4-1999, passed 3-8-99; Am. Ord. 13-2012, passed 8-13-12; Am. Ord. 15-
2016, passed 7-11-16)
§ 52.182 WAIVER OF MONITORING REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the Department Head must annually submit the certification statement in
40 CFR 403.12(q) signed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(1)Waiver of Specific
Pollutants.
   (B)   The Department Head may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized, where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized
or duly authorized representative of the user as specified in §
52.127, and include the following certification statement:
         I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Department Head must be
included as a condition in the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the city for three years after expiration of the waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s
permit by the Department Head, the industrial user must certify on each report
with the statement in division (B)(4) of this section, that there has been no
increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the
industrial user.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s operations,
the user must immediately:
         (a)   Comply with the monitoring requirements of §
52.178, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Department Head; and
         (b)   Notify the Department Head.
      (9)   This provision, does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.

§ 52.183 HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged however, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
52.179. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.175,
52.176,
52.177, and
52.178.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified, in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Department Head, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued, or any
applicable federal or state law.

PART 6: ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.200 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW finds that any industrial
user has violated or is violating this subchapter, or a wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, the Department Head or his or her agent may serve upon
said user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt date
of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted to the Department Head. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of
the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Department Head is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurance of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include compliance schedules, stipulated fines
or remedial actions, and signature of the Department Head and industry
representatives. Consent orders shall be judicially enforceable and have the
same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to §
52.190(D) below.
   (C)   Show cause order. The Department Head may order any user which causes
or contributes to violation of this subchapter, wastewater permit or order
issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested.) at least 10 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner
or corporate officer. Whether or not a. duly notified industrial user appears
as noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate.
   (D)   Compliance order. When the Department Head finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance or a permit or order
issued, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the
discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities are properly
operated, and compliance is achieved. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonable necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring, and management practices. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard
or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the Department Head finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this subchapter or any
permit or order used hereunder, the Department Head may issue an order to cease
and desist all illegal or authorized discharges immediately.
      (1)   In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be given by
telephone.
      (2)   In non-emergency situations, the cease and desist order may be used
to suspend or permanently revoke industrial wastewater discharge permits.
      (3)   The cease and desist order may order the IU to take such
appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address
a continuing or threatened violation, halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
   (F)   Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
subchapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this
subchapter, or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined, in an
amount not to exceed $2,500 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such
assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service charge and
the Department Head shall have such other collection remedies as he has to
collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall
constitute a lien against the individual user’s property. Industrial users
desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for Department Head to
reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the
Department Head believes a. request has merit, he or she shall convene a
hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the
industrial user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The Department Head may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or
causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, the POTW, or the environment.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Department Head prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under this ordinance.
   (H)   Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to
discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from
the control authority. Any user who violates the following conditions of this
subchapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state
or federal law, or both, is subject to permit termination:
      (1)   Violation of permit conditions.
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater.
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes hi operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics.
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises. Non compliant
industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their
wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
52.190(C) of this subchapter why the proposed action should not be taken.

§ 52.201 JUDICIAL REMEDIES.
   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this subchapter or any
order or permit issued hereunder, the city or the Department head, through the
City Attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal or equitable
relief, or both, in the Montgomery Circuit Court.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this subchapter or permit or order
issued hereunder, the city or Department Head, thorough counsel may petition
the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as
may be appropriate) which retrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the city for a maximum civil penalty of allowed under state law per violation,
per day. In the case of a. monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The POTW may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through, the user’s violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any
other factor as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Violations - generally.
         (a)   Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this subchapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall,
upon conviction, by guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed
$2,500 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or
both.
         (b)   In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or imprisonment
for not more than three years or both.
         (c)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications, in any application, record, report, plan or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
ordinance, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this ordinance, shall, upon conviction, be
punished by a fine of not more than $2,500 per violation, per day, or
imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
   (D)   Annual publication of IU’S in significant noncompliance. The city must
publish, at least annually in the largest daily newspaper circulated in the
service area, a description of those industrial users which are found to be in
significant noncompliance with any provisions of this subchapter or any permit
or order issued, hereunder during the period since the previous publication.
   (E)   Legal authority. The remedies provided for in this subchapter are not
exclusive. The city, through its Waste Water Department’s Department Head may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
city’s enforcement response plan. However, the city may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered
totake more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PROCEDURES
§ 52.220 CATEGORIES; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The following categories of noncompliance of industrial and commercial
users shall be subject to enforcement procedures initiated by the City of
Crawfordsville, Indiana.
      (1)   Failure to submit required reports (baseline monitoring reports,
self-monitoring reports, compliance schedule reports and monthly reports).
      (2)   Failure to meet interim or final compliance schedule, scheduled
dates.
      (3)   Violation of maximum or average pollutant limitations for industry
specific categories (categorical standards).
      (4)   Violations of prohibited discharges under the National Pretreatment
Standards (40 CFR 403.5).
      (5)   Violations of local limits outlined in this subchapter as amended.
      (6)   Violations of a major contributor permit.
      (7)   Industrial user’s falsification or tampering of information
submitted to the POTW.
      (8)   Treatment plant upsets and interference’s tracked to an industrial
user.
   (B)   The following shows the enforcement response procedures of the City of
Crawfordsville:
      (1)   Data collection. This process involves the collection of all
available information from inspections, monitoring, reporting, plant upsets and
private complaints.
      (2)   Compliance screening. This process involves the review of all
available information and monitoring data to sort out noncomplying discharges
for appropriate enforcement response. This initial review will address, as
appropriate, compliance with required schedules, compliance with reporting
features or compliance, or both, with applicable categorical standards and
local limitations ordinance.
      (3)   Emergency response. If evaluation of the data reveals an emergency
condition, the city will take whatever means appropriate to bring the violator
into compliance, through immediate telephone contact with the discharger
identifying the problem specifics and requesting immediate corrective measures.
If required more formal measures such as cease and desist orders, injunctive
relief or termination of the service shall be placed into effect so as to
achieve compliance or eliminate the problem occurrence.
      (4)   Enforcement evaluation for noncompliance. The violations and
conditions identified during the screening processes are reviewed to make a
determination relative to the nature of the violation and the type of
enforcement necessary. This process is accomplished by using the criteria
outlined in the attached Enforcement Response Guide.
      (5)   Insignificant noncompliance. This process consists of notifying the
industrial user by phone of the violation. This call outlines the specifics of
the incident and seeks remedial action and response of the discharge. The
insignificant noncompliance process also includes an industry’s failure to
report slug loading, process changes, and failure to send monthly self-
monitoring reports. Multiple insignificant violations will result in industry
being deemed in significant noncompliance.
      (6)   Significant noncompliance. This process consists of notifying the
industrial user by phone and letter of violation (mailed certified, return
receipt requested). The letter of violation outlines the specifics of the
incident (more serious, chronic types of noncompliance as set out in the
attached Enforcement Response Guide) and seeks remedial action and respease-of
the discharge. The city, through its Waste Water Department’s Department Head
(“Department Head”), will then evaluate the response reply-to the letter of
violation and make a determination as to whether the discharger has returned to
compliance. If compliance is not achieved the city will initiate formal
enforcement action.
      (7)   Formal action.
         (a)   Letter of violation. When the city finds that a discharger is in
violation of the admissible limits or the provisions of a major contributor
permit, the city may require the user to submit for approval a detailed letter,
within ten days, of specific actions which the user shall take in order to
prevent or to correct a violation.
         (b)   Informal meeting. This process consists of setting up a meeting
with the industrial users plant manager and the Department Head and industrial
coordinators, to discuss the action the industry will use to bring the
industrial users back into compliance. An informal meeting can require a
response within ten days. The industry may be allowed up to six months to come
into compliance with this action.
         (c)   Compliance schedule. This schedule is necessary whenever an
industrial user is not meeting their limits at the time of promulgation of that
standard. The schedule contains increments of progress (i.e., hiring an
engineer, completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction,
and the like) which corresponds to specific dates for their completion. These
represent milestone dates for coming into compliance. The IU is usually allowed
six to 12 months to comply with this action.
         (d)   Issuance of cease and desist orders. When the Department Head
finds that a discharger is in violation of the admissible limits or the
provisions of their permit, he or she may issue an order to cease and desist to
the industrial user, and direct that the user comply with such provisions:
            1.   Comply immediately;
            2.   Comply with all terms of a compliance schedule as the city
directs; or
            3.   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of
a threatened violation.
         (e)   Injunction. When the Department Head finds that a discharger is
in violation of the subchapter or the provisions of their permit, or otherwise
causes or threatens to cause a condition of pollution or nuisance, the city may
petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or
both, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such a
discharger. These dischargers having significantly violated a permit, are
further subject to fines imposed by the city, in amount of not less than $1,000
the first clay.
         (f)   Civil penalties.
            1.   Any discharger who is found to have violated or fails to
comply with any enforcement action, the orders, rules, regulations,
pretreatment requirements, and permits issued hereunder, may be fined a maximum
civil penalty of $2,500 but not less than $1,000 for each day of violation, in
addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may recover reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, court reporter’s fees and other expenses of
litigation by appropriate suit at law against the industry found to have
significantly violated the ordinance or the orders, rules, regulations and
permits issued.
            2.   Pretreatment requirements are enforceable through the civil or
criminal penalties, or both, as set forth in divisions (B)(7)(f) and (B)(7)(g)
of these Enforcement Response Procedures, which include, but are not limited
to, the duty to allow or carry out inspections, entry or monitoring activities;
any rules, regulations or orders issued by the Department Head; any
requirements set forth in the control, mechanisms issued by the Department
Head; or any reporting requirements imposed by the city or these regulations in
this part.
         (g)   Criminal penalties.
            1.   Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this section or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed
$2,500 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year, or
both.
            2.   In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed $3,000 per violation per day or imprisonment
for not more than three years, or both.
         (h)   Termination of service.
            1.   The city, though the City Attorney, may for good cause suspend
the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater discharge permit of the
discharger when it is evident to the city that an actual or threatened
discharger presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the
environment, interference with the operation of the POTW or violate any
pretreatment limits imposed by the ordinance or any wastewater discharge permit
issued pursuant to the ordinance. Any discharger notified of the suspension of
the city’s wastewater treatment service or the discharger’s wastewater
discharge permit, or both, shall, within a time period determined by the city,
terminate all discharges.
            2.   At the end of each six month period the Superintendent or
Pretreatment Coordinator will be responsible for reviewing the industrial files
to determine any significant non compliance (SNC’s) and if so, shall be
responsible for seeing that the SNC’s are tabulated on an annual basis and that
the name of all SNC’s are published annually in the local paper.

§ 52.221 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE GUIDE.
   This guide is designed to address a broad range of industrial users
violations of monitoring, reporting and treatment requirements that may range
from relatively minor problems to very serious major violations. Each instance
of noncompliance is considered a violation and sound enforcement policy will be
to consider when determining whether a violation is significant or
insignificant.
   (A)   Duration of the violation and compliance history of the IU.
      (1)   The Department Head will review the violation summary to evaluate
the duration of the violation and the compliance history of the industrial
user. Any exceedance of an applicable effluent limit or failure to meet the
deadlines and conditions for reporting, monitoring, or treatment is a
violation. The violation summary will be reviewed for at least one quarter to
determine if the particular types of violations are isolated or recur in some
type of pattern. The Department Head will also consider the enforcement
response that was offered for the previous violations.
      (2)   Isolated violations will usually be attributed to a relatively
simple problem that can be easily corrected. However, when several minor
exceedances occur, either consecutively or several months apart, it may suggest
that operating practices are inadequate to meet the limits and further
pretreatment measures are needed.
      (3)   More aggressive enforcement actions will be taken against
facilities that frequently exceed numerical pretreatment standards than those
that report isolated exceedances (unless the isolated exceedances are large and
troublesome).
   (B)   Apparent good faith of responsible industrial user personnel. If
industrial user personnel appear to be attempting in good faith to comply with
pretreatment requirements, City enforcement actions will obviously be on a more
cooperative level than if industrial user personnel do not appear to be
attempting to comply.
      (1)   City personnel are aware that the Clean Water Act requires
extraordinary efforts to comply with its requirements in a timely way. Good
faith will be measured against this standard:
      Congress clearly expresses the efforts that are expected: The Act
requires industry to take extraordinary efforts if the vital and ambitious
goals of the Congress are to be met. This means that business as usual is not
enough. Prompt, vigorous and in many cases, expensive pollution control
measures must be initiated and completed as promptly as possible. In assessing
the good faith of a discharger, the discharger is to be judged against these
criteria. Moreover, it is an established principle, which applies to this act,
that administrative and judicial reviews are sought on the discharger’s own
time. Legislative history of the Clean Water Act No. 95 14, vol. 3, p. 463
   (C)   Definition of significant noncompliance.
      (1)   Instances of significant noncompliance are defined as follows:
         (a)   Violations of wastewater discharge limits will be evaluated
based on the magnitude and/or frequency of the violations of average limits
over a six month period. These violations will be evaluated on the basis of
individual parameters and monitoring locations.
            1.   Technical review criteria (TRC).
               a.   Thirty three percent (33%) or more of the measurements
exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the
TRC in a six month period.
               b.   Group I for conventional pollutant (BOD, TSS, fats, oil and
grease and pH), TRC factor = 1.4 x parameter limitation value.
               c.   Group II for all other pollutants, TRC factor = 1.2 x
parameter limitation value. (Except pH and temperature).
            2.   Chronic violations are where sixty six percent or more of the
measurements exceed, the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in
a six month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
            3.   Any other violation of an effluent limit (average or daily
maximum) which the City believes has the potential to cause or has caused
interference with the POTW performance capability (e.g., sludge loads) or
passes through the plant in unacceptable quantities (e.g., exceeds water
quality standards or impairing beneficial uses).
         (b)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, for planning,
engineering, starting construction, completing construction and attaining final
compliance by 60 days or more after the schedule date.
         (c)   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-
monitoring data, baseline monitoring reports, or permit application data within
30 days from the due date specified in the ordinance, permit or enforcement
order.
         (d)   Knowingly reporting inaccurate information or falsifying data.
         (e)   Any other violation or group of violations which the City or
Department Head considers to be significant.
   (D)   The harm caused by the violation. Violations are evaluated to
determine the suspected or measured adverse environmental impact and rated
accordingly.

2016, passed 7-11-16)
§ 52.222 TIME FRAMES FOR RESPONSES.
   (A)   All violations will be identified and documented within five working
clays of discovery, and receipt of compliance information.
   (B)   Initial enforcement responses (involving contact with the industrial
user) requesting information on corrective or preventative action(s) will occur
within 15 days of violation detection.
   (C)   Follow up actions will be taken within 60 days of the initial
enforcement response for continuing or reoccurring violations. The response
will include a compliance schedule for all continuing violations.
   (D)   Violations which threaten health, environmental quality, or property
are considered emergencies and will received immediate responses such as
halting the discharge or terminating service.
   (E)   All violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance
(SNC) will be addressed with an enforceable order within 30 days of the
identification of significant noncompliance.

Where an LOV is issued that requires a response and the industrial user fails
to respond, the next level of enforcement will be taken.
 
   (B)   This Range of Enforcement Guide addresses a broad range of
pretreatment violations. It is not intended to cover all types of violations.
The responses in this Guide are suggested responses. They are equally
effective. The measure of the effectiveness of an enforcement response
includes:
      (1)   Whether the non-complying source returns to compliance as
expeditiously as possible.
      (2)   Whether the enforcement response establishes the appropriate
deterrent effect for the particular violator and for other potential violators.
      (3)   Whether the enforcement response promotes fairness to government
treatment as between comparable violators, as well as between complying and
noncomplying parties.
   (C)   This Guide has been developed for guidance and is not intended to
create legal rights or obligations, or to limit the enforcement discretion of
the City of Crawfordsville, Indiana.

§ 52.225 INDUSTRIAL USER INVENTORY.
   (A)   The general pretreatment regulations, 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2), require all
POTWs to identify potential industrial users subject to the requirements of the
pretreatment program and identify the volume and character of pollutants
discharged by the industrial user. The City of Crawfordsville started their
pretreatment program in the mid 1970s and has updated the program on a regular
basis.
   (B)   The city does have all industries with an industrial discharge permit
file do an industrial pretreatment inspection report annually. Pretreatment
personnel go over the report with the industry and do a field inspection to
note any changes in the industry’s process or any plant expansions. The city
also has minor industries file a report to verify there are no changes in their
process. This is done at least once annually.
   (C)   The wastewater plant in Crawfordsville is able to identify new sources
by:
      (1)   Working closely with the City Planner;
      (2)   Working with the Chamber of Commerce;
      (3)   Notified by Sewer Billing Office of any changes in company name or
noticeable change in water usage;
      (4)   Added name to billing list;
      (5)   Sewer connections or inspections;
      (6)   Contacted by potential industry;
      (7)   Site visit;
   (D)   All new industries subject to pretreatment requirements are issued an
industrial discharge permit and added to the master list of regulated
facilities. This information is provided to IDEM on a quarterly basis (part of
the quarterly report). All permitted industries are divided into categorical
and non-categorical groups. This is clarified on the quarterly report along
with what category the industry is listed. All permitted industries are
considered significant industries under the City of Crawfordsville Pretreatment
Program and are subject to all program requirements.
   (E)   Crawfordsville is able to identify the volume and character of
pollutants discharge by the industry by:
      (1)   Scheduled annual inspections;
      (2)   Unscheduled inspections;
      (3)   Industry’s requirements to report changed discharges;
      (4)   Observations from field personnel;
      (5)   Information submitted on industrial discharge permit application;
      (6)   Review of self-monitoring; and
      (7)   Review of surveillance done quarterly.
   (F)   Updated information is put in each industry’s file and gone over with
IDEM on their annual audit.

§ 52.999 PENALTY.
   In addition to all other penalties or requirements contained in this
chapter, any person as herein defined, who shall violate any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be liable to a penalty not to exceed the sum of $1,000
for the first violation, and an additional penalty not to exceed $500 for each
day during which the violation continues; and in addition thereto, such person
or municipal corporation may be enjoined from continuing such violation as
herein provided.

§ 53.16 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and
hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
city.

§ 53.17 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06; Am. Ord. 8-2024, passed 3-12-24)
§ 53.18 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and operating condition by
the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow
and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such an access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.

any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system or waters of the United
States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be a part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 4-2006, passed 2-13-06)
§ 53.20 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system or waters of the United
States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city in person
or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of

§ 53.43 EXEMPTION PROCEDURE; APPEALS.
   (A)   The MS4 Coordinator of the Crawfordsville Stormwater Department hereby
has the authority to grant exemptions and to modify and/or waive any and all
the requirements of this subchapter and its associated technical standards,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. Applicants shall request
specifically a waiver or reduction of the requirements of this subchapter and/
or Stormwater Drainage Manual. Variance/Waiver requests shall meet the
requirements as specified in the Stormwater Drainage Manual.
   (B)   Promptly upon the filing of a building permit or other such
application with the Planning Department, and as part of the routine processing
of all such applications within the city, the MS4 Coordinator will review the
project plans and, if advisable in his or her discretion, perform a site
inspection of the proposed project. The MS4 Coordinator will then complete a
stormwater review and forward it to the Planning Department. The MS4
Coordinator may discuss the applicability of various provisions of this
subchapter and other applicable laws and regulations with regard to the project
with the City Engineer, the City Attorney, and any other city official. The
form and contents of a storm water review may be as simple or as detailed as
necessary to address the particular impact of each project, but the review
shall be in writing and made available to the applicant.
   (C)   If as a result of initial review of the application and any
consultations, the MS4 Coordinator determines that one or more state, federal
or local laws or regulations preclude waiver or modification of this subchapter
or any part of it, then he or she shall so notify the applicant in writing and
deny the request for a waiver or modification.
   (D)   If as a result of the initial stormwater review, the MS4 Coordinator
determines that the project may have an adverse impact on stormwater quantity
and runoff and/or on stormwater quality, then the MS4 Coordinator will request
a pre-construction, pre-building permit approval meeting between
representatives of the city and the applicant (or the applicant's
representatives). This meeting shall be scheduled in an expedient manner and
may be required by the MS4 Coordinator to be held on-site. At or prior to this
meeting, the applicant should provide enough information to address the
concerns of the MS4 Coordinator shown in the review, and if the applicant fails
to address those concerns to the satisfaction of the MS4 Coordinator, a waiver
will not be granted.
   (E)   If as a result of the initial stormwater review, however, the MS4
Coordinator determines that the project will have no or de minimus impact on
stormwater quantity and runoff and/or on stormwater quality, then the MS4
Coordinator may issue a written waiver of the requirements of this subchapter.
However, such a waiver may be revoked at any time if it is shown that the
applicant or the applicant's agents exceeded one or more parameters of the
original building permit application submitted to the city and/or did not
follow the plans submitted to the MS4 Coordinator for review.
   (F)   An applicant who believes a waiver or modification should have been
granted by the MS4 Coordinator may appeal the MS4 Coordinator's adverse
decision to the Board of Public Works and Safety, in which case the Board shall
review the MS4 Coordinator's decision and hear the arguments and review
documentation from the MS4 Coordinator and the applicant (or their
representatives{'}'}, and then the Board may grant a waiver or modification. An
applicant who believes the Board erred may have recourse to the courts as with
any other adverse administrative decision.

permittee obtaining all necessary approvals involving land use from the zoning
board and/or Plan Commission having jurisdiction or authority and complying
with all applicable laws.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)

   (G)   The plan must show the width of existing and adjacent driveways,
streets, alleys and right of way 150 feet beyond property lines on both sides
of the street, plus the plan must show the location of all utilities and any

(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.06 STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS.
   All construction and materials used within the public right-of-way must
conform to the City Engineer “Standard Specifications” which shall be kept on
file at the office of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84) Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 75.07 BONDS REQUIRED.
   The Board may require a performance bond to be filed along with each
application for a commercial driveway with an amount to equal the estimated
cost of that part of the project on the public right-of-way. The Board may also
require adequate bond to be filed in any non-commercial application. Such bonds
are required to insure compliance with all terms of the permit and shall in the
case of non-compliance, provide in addition to any damages suffered thereby,
all witness and court costs in collecting the same, together with any
attorney’s fee professional engineers; fees or land surveyors’ fees reasonably
due, and shall be released only when the work described on the permit has been
completed to the satisfaction of the Board.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.08 LOCATION OF CROSSOVERS.
   Permits for private or commercial crossovers will not be approved unless the
distance to the nearest existing crossover is in excess of 400 feet, unless the
applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the Board that the location of the
crossover will not be detrimental to the safety of the traveling public.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.09 DRIVEWAY STANDARDS.
   The most common examples of driveways and approaches are available from the
City Engineer, entitled “Driveway Standards.” These standards will apply in
majority of cases because many conditions can be derived from each figure.
However, there will be exceptional situations and borderline cases where the
standards and guides do not apply. In such instances, alternate standards will
be used. The next lowest functional type will serve as the alternate dimensions
for each functional type (i.e., the alternate dimensions for arterials are the
dimension for collectors). The use of alternate dimensions will be subject to
the approval of the City Engineer and such approval should precede the filing
of permit application. Additional standards which will be required are as
follows:
   (A)   Entrance and exit only driveways.
      (1)    This type of driveway is not highly recommended for a divided
roadway. However, the entrance and exit driveways do have a purpose and when
warranted use the following dimensions:
         (a)   Minimum width = 11 feet.
         (b)   Maximum width = 17 feet.
      (2)   In order to control entrance and exit drives, they must be properly
signed. This shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
   (B)   Number of driveways and spacing. Driveway spacing is largely dependent
on land use and zoning, and as a result, it is difficult to develop definite
standards. Although from past experience and a literature review on this
subject, not more than two driveways are generally needed to serve a tract of
land. Additional policies are as follows:
      (1)   Arterials. Frontage roads are encouraged but where this is not
feasible a minimum spacing of 150 feet is required between adjacent property
owners. Also, as a general rule, if the frontage is 100 feet or less, only one
driveway will be permitted.
      (2)   Collectors. A minimum spacing of 100 feet is required and generally
only one driveway per 100 feet of frontage will be allowed.
      (3)   Local. No minimum spacing is required; however, only one driveway
per lot will be allowed.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.10 VISIBILITY; TRAFFIC DEVICES; LOCATION OF PROPERTY LINE.
   (A)   All entrances and approaches shall be located so as to provide
adequate sight distance in both directions along the alley, thoroughfare or
highway for safe access to same without interfering with traffic.
   (B)   No entrance or approach shall be located or constructed so as to
interfere with or prevent the proper location of necessary highway signs or
other traffic-control devices.
   (C)   No approach radii shall be so constructed that any part of the same
extends in front of property belonging to persons other than the permittee
unless both property owners sign a joint application for the permit.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.11 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   All improvements authorized by the permit shall not interfere with drainage
of the street or highway, nor cause an additional area to drain onto the right-
of-way. However, part of the improvements within the public right-of-way may
drain toward the street or highway, subject to the approval of the Board.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.12 WORK TO PROCEED SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS.
   Upon receipt of such permit the permit tee is authorized to proceed with the
work covered by it, subject to the conditions imposed by the Board and these
rules. If the application is approved with conditions, all of the signatories
to the original application shall indicate their consent to the conditions in
writing.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.13 FINAL APPROVAL OF THE PERMIT.
   A final approval of the permit shall be issued upon completion of
construction as covered by the permit to construct in accordance with the plans
and specifications filed in the application as amended by the Board; together
with any special conditions set forth by the permit; together with an
acceptance inspection by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.14 LIMITATION OF ACCESS.
   The permittee shall at the time of receipt of a permit to construct sign a
copy of a “Limitation of Access” instrument, if so required by the Board, which
shall be obtained and left with the Permit Clerk of the City Engineer’s Office,
for recording in the deed record, together with a check payable to the County
Recorder covering the cost of recording the instrument. The Permit Clerk shall
immediately cause the limitation of access instrument to be recorded and send
acknowledgment thereof to the permittees.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.15 NOTIFICATION OF CITY ENGINEER.
   Before beginning work under any permit to construct, the permittee shall
notify, in writing, five days prior to start of work, the City Engineer of the
date he will begin such work.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.16 DISPLAY OF PERMIT REQUIRED.
   The applicant’s permit complete with drawings and special provisions shall
be on the job site at all times so that it can be shown, if requested.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.17 IMPROVEMENTS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN CERTAIN TIME PERIOD.
   All improvements authorized by a permit must be completed within one year
after the permit is issued; otherwise, the permit will be cancelled unless an
extension is requested, in writing, by the applicant, and the request is
approved by the Board. However, all construction authorized by the permit on
the right-of-way must be completed within 30 days after starting the
construction, unless otherwise expressly approved as a special condition.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.18 LIABILITY OF PERMITTEE.
   The permittee shall assume all responsibility (during the time from the
beginning of the work covered by any permit until final approval of the work)
and shall furthermore be obligated to save harmless the city from any and all
injury, loss or damage occasioned to or by persons or property resulting
directly or indirectly from such work; the Board, in its discretion, require
the permittee to provide liability and indemnity insurance for the use and
benefit of the city.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.19 CONSTRUCTION NOT TO INTERFERE WITH STRUCTURE IN RIGHT-OF-WAY;
ENCROACHMENT OF SIGNS.
   (A)   The construction of all improvements authorized by the permit shall
not interfere with any existing structure on any city street, alley or
thoroughfare without specific permission in writing from the Board or other
owner thereof. Any structure or traffic-control device affected by the proposed
construction shall be relocated at the applicant’s expense as directed.
   (B)   The permittee shall not erect or maintain any advertising sign on or
over the right-of-way or any portion thereof in violation of any law.
(Ord. 5-1984, passed 2-13-84)
§ 75.20 EXISTING ACCESS.
   Any person, who by law, has an existing legal right of access to a street,
alley or thoroughfare shall, if he desires to improve, relocate, alter or
remodel the same or if he has applied for and been issued final approval of a
permit under these rules, if he desires to make any change in the character of
the use of such right of access, shall as a condition of the issuance of any
permit and in consideration of the same, agree that such rights of access, then
existing or granted thereafter with respect to such real estate shall be
subject to these rules as the same may from time to time be amended by the
Board.

liable in tort for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal condition or
inadequacy in such building, system or plan, nor for any failure of any
component of such, which may occur subsequent to such inspection or permitting.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 94.01 POLICY OF CITY.
   (A)   It is the public policy of the city to provide all of its citizens an

and equal opportunities for acquisition of real property are hereby declared to
be civil rights.

is contrary to the principle of equal opportunity stated in this section as

   (C)   The promotion of equal opportunity without regard to race, religion,
color, sex, age, handicap, national origin or ancestry through reasonable
methods, is the purpose of this chapter. It is also its purpose to protect
employers, labor organizations, employment agencies, property owners, real
estate brokers, lending institutions and insurance companies from unfounded
charges of discrimination.

section, all other penalties applicable to nuisances generally, including
fines, court costs, attorney fees, and restitution shall apply and may be

streets and alternate as provided above. In case of a break in the line of any
street the numbering of the buildings thereon shall recommence with the numbers
that would have been assigned had the street line been continuous and unbroken.

Section
   
99.01   Unlawful growth
   
99.02   Removal
   
99.03   Collection of cost of abatement and lien
§ 99.01 UNLAWFUL GROWTH.
   (A)   Violation. It is unlawful for the owner of any real estate in the city
to allow it to become overgrown with weeds, grass, or other rank vegetation
beyond the height of six inches.
   (B)   Policy. Because growth of weeds, grass, or other rank vegetation
beyond the height of six inches leads to increased presence of insects and
vermin, conceals dangerous conditions of the land, adversely affects the
property and adjacent properties, and otherwise adversely affects the public
health, safety and welfare, it is the policy of the city to prohibit such
conditions and to take all necessary action to remove such conditions.
   (C)   Weeds and rank vegetation. For purposes of this chapter, WEEDS AND
RANK VEGETATION shall include all weeds, grasses and growing plants which
exceed a height of six inches, except agricultural crops, hay and pasture,
garden plants, ornamental grasses and plants used for landscape purposes, wild
flowers, and wetland and/or vegetation drainage.
   (D)   Nuisance. Weeds and rank vegetation which have grown to six inches or
more constitute a nuisance. The city is authorized to abate such nuisances as
provided for in this chapter or in
Chapter 96 of this Code.
(Ord. 17-2014, passed 6-23-14)
§ 99.02 REMOVAL.
   (A)   Administration. The Street and Sanitation Department through the Code
Enforcement Officer shall be responsible for the administration of this
chapter.
   (B)   Notice to correct. 
      (1)   If the city finds a violation of §
99.01, the Code Enforcement Officer shall mail to the property owner, at the
address provided to the County Auditor for tax statements, a notice to correct
the violation. If more than one property owner appears on the records of the
County Auditor, notice is sufficient if only one property owner is provided
notice.
      (2)   This notice shall advise the owner of the violation, describe the
action to be taken by the owner to correct the violation, advise the owner that
he or she has ten days to correct the violation, advise the owner of the city's
remedies if the owner fails to correct, advise the owner of his or her right to
appeal the determination of violation, and notify the owner of any other
information which, at the city's discretion, will further comply with the
city's ordinances.
   (C)   Appeal of notice to correct. If the owner contests the determination
by the city that a violation exists, the owner may appeal this determination by
filing with the Board of Public Works and Safety a written notice of appeal
within seven days of the owner's receipt of the notice to correct. The owner
shall be deemed to have received the notice to correct on the return of receipt
if notified by certified mail or two days after the notice was mailed by
regular first class mail by the city, whichever is later.
   (D)   Procedure for appeal of notice to correct. The Board of Public Works
and Safety shall conduct an evidentiary hearing of the city's determination
within 30 days after the notice of appeal is filed. At this hearing, the city
shall have the burden of proving the violation. The violation must be proved by
a preponderance of the evidence. The owner and the city may be represented by
attorneys, and shall have the right to call witnesses and to confront them, and
to present exhibits and other evidence for the Board's consideration. The Board
shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions not more than ten days
after the hearing and then mail the same to the parties. If the Board
determines that a violation existed, the Board may exercise its remedies as
provided herein. If the Board determines that no violation existed, the notice
to correct shall be deemed void and have no force and effect.
   (E)   Remedies. In the event that the owner fails to correct the violation
as provided for in the notice, the city shall have all of the following
remedies.
      (1)   Fine. The city may fine the owner the sum of $100 for each day the
violation remains unabated. The first day the fine can be assessed is the first
day after the expiration of the ten-day cure period which begins on receipt by
the owner of the notice to correct. The city is not required to provide to the
owner any further notice or document as a precondition to assessing the fine.
The fine will continue to accrue until the violation is corrected as provided
for in the notice. The city shall notify the owner of the fine due, and the
owner shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice to pay the fine to the
Clerk-Treasurer. If the owner fails to pay' the fine within 30 days, the city
may file a complaint for the collection of the fine which accrues due to the
violation.
      (2)   City abatement. If the owner fails to timely abate each violation
set forth in the notice to correct, the owner shall be deemed to have granted
permission to the city to enter the owner's property for the limited purpose of
cutting and/or removing such weeds, grass, or rank vegetation located thereon.
In such case, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee, shall prepare a
certified statement as to the actual administrative and other costs incurred by
the city in taking such action and provide this certified statement to the
Clerk-Treasurer who shall serve a copy of the invoice on the owner. The owner
shall, within 30 calendar days from the date on which the owner is served with
such invoice, pay in full the amount stated thereon to the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   Lien. If the city corrects the violation and incurs the expense of
such corrective work, the city shall be entitled to a lien on the real property
of the owner in an amount equal to the city's cost of correction and expenses
incurred in the prosecution of the enforcement action.
      (4)   Attorney's fees and litigation expenses. If the city brings an
enforcement action under this section, the owner shall be liable for any and
all reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and litigation expenses incurred by
the city in the enforcement action. The city shall notify the owner of these
costs in the notice of fine, and the owner shall have 30 days from receipt of
the notice to pay the sum to the Clerk-Treasurer. If the owner fails to pay the
costs, the city may file a complaint for the collection of these fees, costs
and expenses.
      (5)   Other remedies. The city shall also have any other remedy provided
for by Indiana law or city ordinance. The city may exercise one or more
remedies without waiving its other available remedies.
   (F)   Continuous abatement and notice. If an initial notice to correct was
provided by certified mail or regular first class mail to an owner of property
in violation of this chapter a continuous abatement notice may be posted at the
property at the time of abatement by the city and serves as notice to the owner
that each subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial
notice to correct violation was provided may be abated by the city or its
contractors.
(Ord. 17-2014, passed 6-23-14)
§ 99.03 COLLECTION OF COST OF ABATEMENT AND LIEN.
   (A)   Collection. If the city abates the violation, the Clerk-Treasurer
shall notify the owner of the actual costs of abatement, and the amount of the
administrative fee. If the owner fails to pay the costs and fee within 30 days,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify the unpaid amount to the Montgomery County
Auditor, plus any additional administrative costs incurred in the
certification.
   (B)   Lien.  The Montgomery County Auditor shall place the total amount
certified on the real estate tax duplicate for the property affected. The
Montgomery County Treasurer shall collect the amount certified as delinquent
taxes and disperse the funds collected to the city's general fund.
   (C)   Appeal of fine or costs. Within seven days of receiving from the city
a notice of fines and expenses due, the owner may file an appeal of the city's
determination by filing with the Board of Public Works and Safety a written
notice of appeal. If the owner fails to appeal, he or she waives the right to
contest the amount claimed due by the city. The appeal process shall be the
same process provided for in this section for appeals of the city's
determination of a violation.

§ 150.24 REVIEW OF APPLICATION.
   Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the Building Commissioner
shall:
   (A)   Review all building permit applications to determine full compliance
with the provisions of this code and any other applicable city ordinance.
   (B)   Review all building permit applications for new construction or
substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding.
   (C)   Review building permit applications for major repairs within the flood
plain area having special flood hazards to determine that the proposed repair
uses construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood
damage, and uses construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
   (D)   Review building permit applications for new construction or
substantial improvements within the flood plain area having special flood
hazards to assure that the proposed construction (including prefabricated and
mobile homes) is protected against flood damage; is designed (or modified) and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
from flood damage; and uses construction methods and practices that will
minimize flood damage.
   (E)   Review the Drainage Board’s Approval of the Storm Water Drainage Plan.
   (F)   Conflicts of interest.
      (1)   Definitions. For purposes of this division (F), the following

            4.   Approval of a site-specific development plan;
            5.   Approval of a primary or secondary plat;

exception or special use; or

      (2)   Conflict of interest prohibited. The Building Commissioner,
Building Code Official, or Building Inspector is prohibited from issuing a
building permit or oversee the issuance of a permit if the Building
Commissioner, Building Code Official, or Building Inspector possesses a
conflict of interest.
      (3)   Notice to department head. If the Building Commissioner, Building
Code Official, or Building Inspector has a conflict of interest in the issuance
of a permit, he or she must report the conflict, in writing, to his or her
department head immediately upon learning of the conflict. The department head
must place this notice in the permit applicant's file. If the department head
himself or herself has a conflict of interest in the issuance of a permit, he
or she must provide additional written notice to the Mayor, which must also be
included in the permit applicant's file.
      (4)   Disqualification. If the Building Commissioner or a Building Code

qualified independent contractor to oversee the issuance or denial of a permit.
Any appointment made or contract entered into under this policy must be with an
individual who does not possess a conflict of interest in the issuance of the
permit in question. The department head shall follow all city policies when
contracting a qualified temporary replacement.
      (6)   Exclusion of disqualified official. The department head must ensure
that all documents, records, and communications regarding the issuance of the
permit are removed from the possession of the Building Commissioner, Building
Code Official, or Building Inspector who possesses a conflict of interest. The
department head shall also ensure that the employee is excluded from any
internal meetings, deliberation, or communication regarding the issuance of the
permit.
      (7)   Document retention. The department head must retain all documents
regarding the conflict of interest in the permit file and the official's
personnel file for a period of ten years.
      (8)   Penalties. Failure of a Building Commissioner, Building Code
Official, or Building Inspector to notify the department head of a conflict of
interest will subject the employee to discipline. This discipline may include
suspension without pay and/or termination.

effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these
subdivision regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any
public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in
conformity with the regulations contained herein and in conformity with
building code standards adopted by the city if they have been enacted and are
in force.
   (A)   Administrative subdivisions.
      (1)   Types of administrative subdivisions. An administrative subdivision
is a subdivision of land that, unless specified otherwise, is specifically
exempted from the preliminary and final plat approval procedures of this
chapter. An administrative subdivision must be one of the following types of
divisions:
         (a)   A division of land for residential use into two additional
tracts from the parent tract of which all tracts are at least one and one half
acres in size with the parent tract maintaining a minimum of ten acres,
provided the parent tract is greater than 13 acres in size.
         (b)   A division of land into no more than four tracts for an
agricultural use.
         (c)   A division of land for the transfer of tract or tracts to
correct errors in an existing legal description, provided that no additional
building sites (accessory structure excluded) are created by the division.
         (d)   A division of land pursuant to an allocation of land in the
settlement of a decedent’s estate or court decree for the distribution of
property.
         (e)   A division of land for the unwilling sale of land as a result of
legal condemnations as defined and allowed by state law.
         (f)   A division of land for federal, state, or local government to
acquire street right-of- way;
         (g)   A division of land for the transfer of a tract or tracts between
adjoining lots, provided that the division does not create a buildable lot for
a principal use structure;
         (h)   A division of land into cemetery plots for the purpose of burial
of corpses;
         (i)   A division of land for the purpose of straightening property
boundary lines, provided that the division does not cause a change in the
existing land use.
         (j)   A residential lot split of three lots or fewer, which does not
involve the construction of any new street or road, or the imposition of any
adverse effect upon the use of the remainder of the land or adjacent property.
      (2)   In the event of reasonable uncertainty as to whether a lot split or
subdivision will have an adverse effect upon the use of the remainder of the
land or adjacent property or otherwise qualifies as an administrative
subdivision, a person seeking to subdivide property pursuant to division (A) of
this section shall request a review of the proposed subdivision or lot split by
the Plan Director, who shall have the discretion to determine whether it has an
adverse impact or otherwise qualifies as an administrative subdivision. In the
event that a recorded subdivision or lot split does in fact have an adverse
impact, failure to request review by the Plan Director may result in subsequent
invalidation of the subdivision or lot split or denial of improvement location
permits or certificates of occupancy for having been subdivided in violation of
this section.
   (B)   Major subdivisions (residential or non-residential). Major
subdivisions include any land, vacant or improved, which is divided or proposed
to be divided into four or more lots of record for the purpose of offer, sale,
lease, or development either on the installment plan or upon any and all other
plans, terms, and conditions, including re-subdivision. Major subdivisions are
subject to a two- step approval process: primary and secondary review and
approval. Recording of the plat is not authorized until after secondary plat
approval is granted. All subdivision of land for non-residential use shall be
subject to the major subdivision process. Where upon completion of all
development, the exact measurements of the location of: building footprints;
roads; utility lines; easements; dedicated parks, open spaces, and facilities;
and the like erected during the development are necessary for public record and
shall therefore be recorded. The developer shall submit a copy of the approved
Construction Plans (as-built plans), as amended, to the Planning Director with
the exact measurements thereon shown. The Planning Director, after being
satisfied that the measurements are substantially the same as indicated on the
originally approved final plan(s), shall approve, date and sign said
Construction Plans for the project, which the developer shall then record.
   (C)   Minor subdivisions (non-residential). Non-residential minor
subdivisions may be subject to a one-step approval process. If an applicant is
seeking approval for a subdivision of three lots or less that does not involve
the construction of any new street or road, or the imposition of any adverse
effect upon the use of the remainder of the land or adjacent property as
determined by the Commission, and the activity does not conflict with either a
provision or portion of the Comprehensive Plan, the Official Zoning Map, the
Zoning Ordinance, approval of the minor subdivision plat may be given by the
Area Plan Commission at a single meeting. The applicant shall provide the Area
Plan Commission a plat and any other such information as deemed necessary by
the staff. Recording of the plat is not authorized until after plat approval is
granted.

§ 152.005 CONDOMINIUMS.
   I.C. 32-25 states that condominiums are exempt from local subdivision
control ordinances, meaning that the platting of condominium units regulated by
I.C. 32-25: Condominiums, is exempt for the provisions of this chapter.
Conversely, a condominium is formed by the filing of the declaration with the
County Recorder. Among other things, the declaration will contain the
following: the description of the land, the building (including the number of
stories and units), the common areas, the limited common areas, the percentage
of the undivided interest in the common areas, restrictions and the bylaws will
be attached. While exempt from the platting requirements of this chapter, all
condominium projects shall comply with all other applicable standards and
regulations adopted by the city, this includes, but is not limited to the
Zoning Ordinance, Building Code, and the city’s construction manual adopted by
the Board of Public Works and Safety. Therefore, prior to obtaining a building
permit for the construction of condominium property, the builder(s) or
developer(s) shall file a copy of the executed and recorded declaration of the
project as a condominium project with the Planning Director consistent with §
153.056(F).

practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by
an alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to these subdivision
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
served, provided that the waivers shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of these regulations, and further provided the Commission
shall not approve waivers unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence

unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.

Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or official map as interpreted by the
Commission and the Planning Director.

authority for administration and enforcement of the bonds shall then lie with
the Planning Director.
   (B)   Types of performance bonds. The following types of performance bonds
may be filed with the city:
      (1)   Insurance bond.  The petitioner shall post an insurance bond
securable to the city in the amount equivalent to 110% of the applicants
estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements.
      (2)   Certified check. In lieu of a bond, the petitioner may submit a
certified check made payable to the City in an amount equivalent to 110% of the

bonded improvements within 24 months of the date of acceptance of the original
performance bond, the city reserves the right to require the developer to re-
submit current bond estimates and, if deemed necessary by the city, re-submit
updated performance bonds.
   (D)   Performance bond released/maintenance bond received.
      (1)   Upon completion of the public improvements within a subdivision or

inspection, submit a certificate of completion and compliance, and submit as-
built plans of the improvements. Upon receipt of this request, the Planning
Director and/or other appropriate city representatives shall inspect the
improvements and submit a recommendation to the Planning Director. Any
deficiencies found in the design and workmanship of public improvements shall
be corrected by the developer prior to release of the performance bond.
      (2)   At such time as the public improvements are acceptable to the
Administrator or his designee, the Administrator shall release the performance
bond in lieu of a three-year maintenance bond. The amount of the maintenance
bond shall be equal to or greater than 20% of the corresponding performance
bond. Maintenance bonds shall be in one of the forms as deemed acceptable for
performance bonds. Maintenance bonds shall also be required after acceptance of
completed improvements for which no performance bond was posted.

and the city shall thereby assume full and permanent responsibility for
maintenance of the public improvement.
   (G)   Acceptance by the city.  Construction and maintenance of a public
improvement shall be deemed as the full responsibility of the developer until
the public improvement is accepted by official action and written notice by the
Planning Director. Expiration of a maintenance bond does not relieve a
developer from the responsibility of having the public improvements meet city
standards and specifications prior to official acceptance by the city. Such
improvements shall be completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, and
the applicant shall dedicate such improvements to the city or county free and
clear of all encumbrances.

§ 152.031 RECORDING OF SUBDIVISION PLAT.
   (A)   Legal effect of subdivision. The plat of the subdivision is without
legal effect unless and until approved and signed by the Plat Committee as
herein provided and filed with the Auditor and the Recorder of Montgomery
County. Unless the plat is duly recorded within 90 days from the date of the
secondary plat approval, the Plat Committee approval of the plat shall expire
and shall be of no effect until subsequently reinstated by the Plat Committee.
   (B)   Extension. Recording of a secondary plat upon granting of secondary
approval may be extended by the Plan Commission until improvements are
completed and the plat is signed if it is the intention of the petitioner to
complete the improvements before the plat is signed rather than posting a
performance bond.
   (C)   Subdivision of land by reason of leasehold interest only. This
provision requiring the recording of a subdivision plat upon the granting of
secondary approval may be waived by the Plan Commission in the case of
development of land coming within the definition of subdivisions under this
chapter solely by reason of the division of land by reason of leasehold
interests only. In such case, the subsequent transfer of ownership of any
portion or parcel thereof by other than leasehold interest, shall require the
same to be resubmitted to the Plat Committee for approval under the terms of
this chapter, including recording.

development because of improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formation or topography, utility easements or other features
which might reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the developer to solve the problems created by the unsuitable
land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for those uses permitted by the
Crawfordsville Zoning Ordinance which do not involve any such danger.
   (B)   Inclusion of a thoroughfare.  Whenever a tract to be subdivided
embraces any part of a major street, boulevard or parkway, this part of the
proposed public way shall be platted by the applicant and the locations and the

§ 152.046 STREETS.
   (A)   General requirement. In order to provide subdivision streets of
suitable location, width and construction; and to afford access to police, fire
fighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance equipment; and to
coordinate subdivision street development with the existing street system and
the Comprehensive Plan, all subdivision streets in the secondary plat submitted
for approval shall be designed in accord with the standards set forth in this
section, as amended from time to time, as well as the city specifications
adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, as amended from time to time.
In the event that mere is a conflict between this chapter and the
Specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and Safety, the more
restrictive standard shall apply.
   (B)   Arrangement standards. The layout of subdivision streets shall conform
to the following:
      (1)   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through traffic.
      (2)   Subdivision streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the
subdivision tract and be installed as stub-streets in order to provide for
their future extension into adjacent areas.
      (3)   Streets and access ways in business and industrial developments
shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, the location of
rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering
areas, walkways, and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement
between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
      (4)   All streets and alleys shall have a clear vertical clearance from
the roadway surface to any overhead obstruction of at least 15 feet.
   (C)   Intersection standards. The following standards shall apply to all
subdivision street intersections:
      (1)    With the exception of roundabouts, the centerlines of intersecting
streets shall intersect as near as possible at right angles (90 degrees), in
which case the intersecting angles of said streets shall be no less than 75
degrees. All intersections are subject to approval of the Plan Commission.

      (2)   The simultaneous intersection of streets resulting in traffic from
more than four streets is prohibited.
      (3)   The property, or right-of-way lines, of comer lots at street
intersections shall be rounded at the comer with an arc, of at least 15 feet
minimal radius, drawn tangent to each of the intersection property lines.
      (4)   The minimum distance between the centerlines of parallel or
approximately parallel streets intersecting a cross-street from opposite
directions shall be 125 feet.

   (E)   Topography.
      (1)   Subdivision streets shall be arranged in proper relation to the
topography in a manner which results in usable lots, safe streets and
acceptable gradients; and in a manner which does not cause unnecessary
destruction of drainage courses, trees and other natural features of the land.
      (2)   Rectangular, “gridiron” streets shall be avoided, and the use of
curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout and topographical relationship. Innovative, varying
geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where such provide a sense of
order and enhance esthetic interest.
      (3)   Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards specified by these
regulations shall be required whenever additional width is necessary, due to
topographical conditions, to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes. Such
slopes shall not be in excess of a three to one (3:1) height to width ratio.
   (F)   Alleys.  Alleys may be allowed in all commercial and industrial
districts. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential districts except where
justified by unusual conditions or consistent with the proposed development
pattern.
   (G)   Cul-de-sacs/dead end streets. Cul-de-sacs shall not be permitted in
any district where such are in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan. No
permitted cul-de-sac shall provide principle frontage to more than 20 lots or
be longer than 500 feet, including a turn-around, whichever is less. Whenever a
collector street exclusively serves an industrial or commercial area, a cul-de-
sac of up to 1,000 feet in length may be allowed. This special provision shall
be allowed only in areas where access is difficult or which are otherwise
unsuitable for normal subdividing. The minimum radii for cul-de-sacs shall be
as prescribed in the city specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works
and Safety, as amended from time to time.
   (H)   Continuation of streets, alleys and easements. Whenever a dedicated or
platted portion of a street, alley or easement exists adjacent to a proposed
subdivision, the continuation of the street, alley or easement right-of-way at
the prescribed width, shall be platted within said subdivision unless the
Commission deems such continuation unnecessary.
   (I)   Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths. Subdivision streets and
alleys shall be designed in accordance with the city specifications adopted by
the Board of Public Works and Safety, as amended from time to time.
   (J)   Construction standards. All subdivision streets shall be constructed
according to the following standards:
      (1)   Subdivision streets shall be completed to the grades specified on
their respective plans, profiles and cross-sections as approved by the
Commission.
      (2)   The minimum specifications for subdivision street construction and
materials shall be as set forth in the applicable sections of the
“Crawfordsville Standards,” as amended from time to time, except where the
Commission has by rule adopted a different set of standards and specifications,
or as required in this chapter. Street surfaces shall be of a character
suitable for expected traffic and shall be in harmony with similar improvements
in the surrounding area.
   (K)   Railroads and limited access highways. If a proposed subdivision plat
adjoins a railroad right- of-way and/or a limited access highway, the following
requirements shall apply:
      (1)   In all residential districts, a buffer strip of at least 25 feet in
depth, in addition to the normal lot depth required for such districts by the
Zoning Code in Chapter 153 and amendments thereto, shall be provided adjacent
to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be
part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the submitted preliminary
plat as follows: “This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structures hereon, other than earth berms, walls, fences and other landscape
screening devices approved by the Commission is prohibited.”
      (2)   In all districts, streets running parallel to a railroad right-of-
way shall be located at least 150 feet from said right-of-way upon intersecting
with a street which crosses the railroad at grade.
   (L)   Street names.  Subdivision street names shall not duplicate any
existing street name within the county except in the case of a direct
extension. Street names that are spelled differently from, but sound the same
as, existing streets shall not be allowed. In no instance shall any street name
include the word north, south, east or west, unless it denotes a geographic
location. In event of a conflict, the Plan Commission shall have final
authority to name all streets upon granting preliminary or secondary plat
approval.
   (M)   Street dedications and reservations.
      (1)   All subdivision streets shall be dedicated to public use. The
Commission may consider allowing private streets in the event of unusual
physical conditions and if the applicant can provide evidence that a private
street is the only feasible solution. Such private streets may be authorized
provided that the standards applied in their construction comply with this
section and the city specifications adopted by the Board of Public Works and
Safety, and that adequate covenant provisions are made for direct
responsibility and control, by the property owners involved, for the perpetual
operation, liability and maintenance of said private streets at no expense to
the city.
      (2)   Subdivision street systems shall be laid out in a manner which
eliminates or avoids new perimeter half-streets. When an existing half-street
is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant. The Commission may authorize a new
perimeter street where the applicant improves and dedicates the entire required
right-of-way width within his own subdivision’s boundaries.
      (3)   Whenever a proposed subdivision borders an existing street, the
Commission may require the reconstruction or widening of such street as a
condition of preliminary or secondary plat approval. Land reserved for any
street purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or area requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance in Chapter 153 or amendments thereto.
(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 152.047 TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.

of the city or county.
   (B)   Installation of warning signs and other traffic control devices. The
city shall be responsible for the installation of all warning signs and other
traffic control devices, except where warranted in industrial and commercial
areas. The developer may be required to pay the cost of the study to establish
a need for said traffic signal as well as the installation and interconnection
of said traffic signal.
(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)

   (A)   Location. Sidewalks shall be provided by the applicant on each side of
all streets within the subdivision.
   (B)   Provision of easements. The Commission may require perpetual,
unobstructed easements, at least ten feet in width, in order to facilitate
pedestrian access from the street to schools, parks, playgrounds or other
nearby streets. Such easements shall be indicated on both the preliminary and
secondary plats.
   (C)   Grading.  Grading of the entire right-of-way shall be provided for the
location of sidewalks one foot from front lot lines, and a proper grade shall
be provided by the applicant according to the standards shown on the plans,

square inch. The applicant shall submit plans showing the location, depth, size
and material of mains, valves and connections for the approval of the
appropriate Board of Health and/or the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management prior to application for secondary plat approval.
      (3)   Individual wells. If the applicant submits acceptable evidence to
the Montgomery County Board of Health and the Commission that neither of the
above two water systems is necessary due to low density of the development, the
lack of limiting physical site conditions, or the proximity of the development
to existing or planned public or quasi-public water systems, then the
Commission may permit an individual water supply for each lot in the
development subject to compliance with all of the requirements of and approval
by the Montgomery County Board of Health.
(Ord. 5-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 152.052 SANITARY SEWAGE FACILITIES.

   (B)   Sewerage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or
alley right-of-ways or utility easements unless topographic conditions require
an alternative location.
   (C)   Manholes.  Manholes shall be placed in public right-of-ways where a
sewer line in a private easement intersects such public right-of-way. Access
shall be provided for all manholes located in private property easements.
   (D)   Type of installation. The applicant shall install a subdivision
sanitary sewerage system by one of the following means:
      (1)   Municipal. A complete system which conveys sewage into an
established municipal or other public agency sanitary sewage disposal and
treatment system, and which is approved in writing by said municipal or public
agency. The applicant shall submit plans, prepared by a registered land
surveyor at the applicant’s expense, showing all location, materials, size,
profiles and connections at the time of application for secondary approval.

treatment plant provided by the applicant, or others, in accordance with the
requirements of the Montgomery County Board of Health and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.
      (3)   Individual septic systems. If the applicant submits acceptable
evidence to the Montgomery County Board of Health and the Commission that
neither of the above two sewage systems is necessary due to low density of the
development, the lack of limiting physical site conditions, or the proximity of
the development to existing or planned public or quasi-public sanitary sewer
systems, then the commission may permit individual sanitary sewer systems for
each lot in the development subject to compliance with all of the requirements
of and approval by the County Board of Health.
   (E)   Pre-annexation agreement required. Where a proposed subdivision lies
outside of the corporate boundaries of the city and intends to connect to the

      (1)   Easements shall be provided for public, quasi-public and private
utilities. Such easements shall be at least ten feet wide on each side. The
applicant shall establish all necessary coordination of proposed subdivision
easements with existing adjoining easements with all applicable utility
providers.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions make the inclusion of
utilities along rear lot lines impractical, perpetual, unobstructed easements,
at least 20 feet in width, shall be provided along side lot lines, with
satisfactory access to either the road or rear lot lines.
      (3)   All easements shall be indicated on the submitted secondary plat
and all plats shall contain a statement to the effect that all utility
easements, as dedicated for use by the utilities on the face of the plat, shall
be kept free of all other permanent structures, and the removal of any
obstructions shall in no way obligate the utility company in damages or to
restore the obstruction to its original form.

provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the city.
   (B)   Continuation of an existing land use. An existing, legally established
land use is lawful and not in violation of the city code, provided that it is
operated and maintained in compliance with all other applicable provisions of
this chapter.
   (C)   Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on projects in progress. This
chapter, as amended from time-to-time, may impose different standards on new
land uses, structures, or improvements than those that formerly applied to
existing development. The following provisions determine how the requirements
of this chapter apply to projects in progress at the time the requirements of
this chapter are changed.
      (1)   Projects with pending applications. Projects in which the
application has not yet been determined to be complete by the Planning Director
before the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto will be
processed according to the requirements in effect when the application was
deemed to be complete.
      (2)   Approved projects not yet under construction. Consistent with I.C.
36-7-4-1109, any approved development project for which construction has not
begun as of the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, may
still be constructed as approved, so long as the first improvement location
permit is obtained within three years and where construction is substantially
complete within seven years of the submittal of the complete application.
Should either of these requirements not be met, the project will be subject to
the most recent, or current provisions of this chapter, rather than the
regulations in place at the time the application was filed.
      (3)   Approved projects not requiring construction.  Any approved
development project not requiring construction, that has not been established
as of the effective date of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, may still
be established in compliance with its approved permit, so long as establishment
occurs before the expiration of said permit.
      (4)   Projects under construction.  Approved improvements and/or
structure(s) under construction at the time this chapter or any amendments
thereto, shall be continued under the chapter in which they were reviewed and
approved. The improvements and/or structure(s) shall be substantially complete
within seven years of the issue date of submissions of the complete
application. If the improvements or structure(s) are not substantially complete
within seven years from submission of the complete application, the city shall
require said improvements and/or structure(s) to conform to the standards of
the ordinance(s) in effect at that time.
   (D)   Conformity of lots created prior to adoption of this chapter. Any lot
legally created prior to the effective date of this chapter which does not meet
the minimum lot size required by this chapter shall be considered legal non-
conforming.
   (E)   Other requirements may still apply. Nothing in this chapter shall
eliminate the need for obtaining any other approval or entitlement required by
other provisions of the city code or the requirements of any city department,
or any local, state or federal agency.
   (F)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, those provisions which are more restrictive or impose higher standards
shall govern.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, except in
instances where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or
impose higher standards or regulations than any easement, covenant, or other
private agreement or restriction, in which case the requirements of these
regulations shall govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or
private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more
restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of these regulations or
the determinations of the Commission in enforcing these regulations, and the
private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or
determinations hereunder, then the private provisions shall be operative an
supplemental to these regulations, or the determinations made there under. In
addition, private provisions shall only be enforced privately.

flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no
base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply. Zone AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements

shall be kept on file and available for examination at the office of the City
Clerk Treasurer, and the office of the City Plan Commission.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.021 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   District boundaries shown within the lines of streets, streams, and
transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow their centerlines. The
vacation of streets shall not affect the location of such district boundaries.
When the Planning Director cannot definitely determine the location of a
district boundary by such centerlines, by the scale of dimensions stated on the
Zone Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, he or
she shall refuse action, and the Board of Zoning Appeals, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of
the Zone Map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.022 ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The city and contiguous unincorporated area are divided into the districts
stated in this chapter as shown by the district boundaries on the Zone Map.
There are created for zoning purposes within the territory under the
jurisdiction of the Plan Commission, classes of districts with the following
names and designations:
   (A)   Conservation District. The conservation district (“C-1") is intended
to be limited to agricultural, recreational and certain other open land uses.
The purpose of this district is to prevent intensive development of land that
is unsuitable for development because of topography, soil conditions, periodic
flooding, or other natural features. Residential and related uses may be
permitted by special exception. Refer to the Appendix A: Official Schedule of
Uses.
   (B)   Agricultural-Residential District. The agricultural-residential
district (“A-R”) is intended for areas that cannot feasibly be served with
public water and sewer facilities. This district will preserve and protect
agricultural land from undesirable urban growth while permitting residential
development on large lots, which provide adequate space for private water and
sewerage facilities.
   (C)   Residential Districts.  The residential districts (“R-l”, “R-2", and
“R-3") are intended to be limited to dwellings and public or semi-public uses
which are normally associated with residential neighborhoods. The only uses
permitted in the residential districts are those which would not detract from
the residential character of the neighborhood (refer to Appendix A: the
Official Schedule of Uses). While the number of families, the lot and yard
requirements, and the setbacks may vary between each residential district so
that the city may provide for the housing needs and desires of all its
citizens, the overarching purpose of these districts is to create an
attractive, stable, and orderly residential neighborhood environment.
   (D)   Business Districts. The business districts (“B-1, “B-2", and “B-3")
are intended to be limited to business, public and certain residential uses and
to provide for conveniently located unified shopping destinations. Through the
establishment of relatively compact districts for all business related uses,
the city is better able to provide for more efficient and effective traffic
movement, parking facilities, and emergency services. Industrial uses are often
excluded in order to reduce the hazards caused by the extensive truck and rail
movements which are typically associated with such industrial uses. The “B-
1 district is intended to be limited to the downtown area.
   (E)   Industrial Districts. The industrial districts (“I-1" and “I-2") are
intended to provide suitable space for the expansion of existing industrial
uses as well as for future industrial development. The desirable location for
these districts are parcels near railroads or highways. These parcels are
typically well suited to the transportation needs of industrial uses.
Performance and developing standards and regulations are set forth in this
chapter in order to insure that industrial development is compatible with
adjacent uses.
   (F)   Planned Unit Development District. The intent of a planned unit
development (PUD) is to encourage innovative residential communities and mixed-
use developments within the City of Crawfordsville that will preserve the
natural amenities of the site and provide for the general welfare of the
jurisdiction. Developers of planned unit developments will be offered
flexibility in design and development. However, a PUD shall not compromise the
purpose of this chapter nor shall it be a far departure from the purpose and
intent of the original district.
   (G)   Stream Corridor District. The purpose of the stream corridor district
(“SC”) is to preserve and protect the existing natural and scenic qualities of
lands adjacent to streams of unique historical, scenic and recreational value.
By limiting the type of uses permitted, either by right or be special
exception, within the SC District, the city is better able to: preserve the
stream and the lands adjacent to it in an undisturbed natural state so as to
add in the aesthetic appeal and water quality of the stream corridor; protect
wildlife and natural vegetation; and, prevent erosion. The Stream Corridor
District shall extend 150 feet horizontally in each direction measured from the
center thread and/or secondary thread of the stream. Special exceptions may
require flood plain permits and/or recommendations from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. These permits and/or recommendations shall be obtained
prior to any action by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The BZA may impose greater
restrictions. In addition, there shall be no clear cutting of timber or
complete removal of vegetation within the district. Timber may be cut using
good forestry practices and vegetation may be trimmed.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
EXPLANATION OF USE CLASSIFICATIONS
§ 153.030 OFFICIAL SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Certain principal and accessory uses are permitted, either by right or by
special exception, in each zoning district. The city’s Official Schedule of
Uses shall determine whether or not a specific use is permitted or prohibited
in each of the established zoning districts. Uses not specifically listed or
defined to be included in this division shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
Cross reference:
   Schedule of Uses, see
Ch. 153, Appendix A
§ 153.031 PERMITTED USES.
   Permitted uses are allowed, by right, in a particular zoning district or
districts and shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to that zoning
district. Permitted uses do not require consideration or approval by the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.032 SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES.
   Certain uses may be appropriate in any number of districts; however, some
uses may require an added degree of scrutiny in the form of development plan
review to ensure that the proposed activities, traffic generation, on- and off-
street parking, and other elements of the project do not negatively affect
adjacent properties. Special exception uses are only permissible with the
issuance of a special exception use permit. The special exception uses for each
district are listed in the official schedule of uses. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall take into consideration all of the applicable provisions of this
chapter, and any other applicable ordinance or regulations when reviewing and
deciding on any special exception use permit.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.033 ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   Accessory uses and structures such as privacy garages, tool sheds, fences,

§ 153.035 NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS AND STRUCTURES.
   Within the districts established by this chapter, including amendments
thereto, there may exist lots, uses, or structures which were lawful before the
effective date of this chapter, but which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to
allow said nonconforming lots, uses, or structures to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to prevent the strengthening, or restoring to a safe condition, any
building or part thereof which has been declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety. The existence of nonconforming lots,
uses and structures is not to be used as grounds for adding similar lots, uses
or structures which would otherwise be prohibited. Nonconforming situations
shall be governed as follows:
   (A)   Agricultural uses. Consistent with I.C. 36-7-4-616, an agricultural
use of land that constitutes an agricultural nonconforming use may be changed
to another agricultural use of land without losing agricultural nonconforming
use status. In addition, an agricultural nonconforming use shall not be
restricted or required to obtain a variance or special exception so long as an
agricultural nonconforming use has been maintained for three years in a five
year period.
   (B)   Single nonconforming lots of record. In any district, construction on
a single nonconforming lot of record in existence prior to the effective date
of this chapter, as amended from time-to-time, and excluding any other
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, are subject to the
following:
      (1)    Any nonconforming lot shall be in a separate ownership and not
contiguous with other lots in the same ownership; and
      (2)   All setback, height and other applicable provisions of the zoning
district shall be satisfied unless appropriate variances are obtained.
   (C)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two or more lots, or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership, are of record prior to the effective date of this chapter, as
amended from time-to-time, and if all or part of the lot(s) which is void of
any structure(s) do not meet the requirements established for lot width and
area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter. No portion of the parcel
shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot,
width, and area requirements established by this chapter. Nor shall any
division of a parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter.
   (D)   Nonconforming uses. Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter,
lawful use(s) of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed by this chapter, as amended from time-to- time, the use(s) may be
continued so long as they otherwise remain lawful. Such uses shall also be
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be continued but shall not be extended,
expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use, except as permitted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   A nonconforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel.
      (3)   In the event that any nonconforming use which is conducted within a
structure ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of one year, said
nonconforming use shall not be resumed, unless approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
      (4)   No structure shall be erected, constructed, or altered in
connection with a legally nonconforming use of land.
   (E)   Nonconforming structures. Where a structure that could no longer be
built under the provisions of this chapter exists, the structure may continue
to exist so long as it remains otherwise lawful. Said structure shall also be
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   A nonconforming structure may continue to exist but shall not be
enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. Conversely, a
nonconforming structure may be altered so as to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood, explosion,
wind, or other catastrophe may be reconstructed and used as before if:
         (a)   Such reconstruction is performed within 12 months of such
catastrophe; and
         (b)   If the restored structure has no greater coverage and no greater
cubic content than before such catastrophe.
      (3)   (a)   In the event that any nonconforming use conducted in a
structure or at a location ceases for any reason for a continuous period of one
year; or
         (b)   In the event that such nonconforming use is intentionally
abandoned for any period, such nonconforming use shall not be resumed, except
with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (4)   No nonconforming structure shall be moved for any reason for any
distance, unless said structure is being removed from the site.
      (5)   Work may be done on any nonconforming structure in any period of 12
consecutive months. Such work may include ordinary repairs such as the repair
or replacement of non-load bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing,
provided that the repaired structure has no greater coverage and contains no
greater cubic content than before such repairs.
      (6)   If a nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, becomes
physically unsafe or by reason of its physical condition, shall not thereafter
be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with this chapter.
   (F)   Nonconforming uses and structures in combination. Where a lawful use
occupied by a lawful structure existed prior to the effective date of this
chapter, as amended from time-to-time, where one or the other, or both, do not
comply with the requirements imposed by this chapter, nonconforming combination
of use and structure may be continued so long as they both remain otherwise
lawful. Such a combination shall also be subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered, except to change the use from a legally nonconforming use
to a conforming use, in which case, such modifications shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
legally nonconforming status of the use, in which case, both the structure and
the use shall be brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter,
as amended from time-to-time.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 153.045 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   Open space requirement. A PUD shall contain permanently reserved land
suitable for the common use of the public or the owners within the PUD. This
may be accomplished by dedication, covenant, or easement. Said open space may
be comprised of non-buildable land as the result of topography, soil
conditions, wetlands, and the like. The open space shall constitute a minimum
of 10% of the gross acreage less rights of way. This land may be used for
recreational or scenic open space, or as a landscaped buffer as approved by the
Commission. This land may also be set aside as sites for future public
facilities. Provisions for permanent control and maintenance of this land shall
be outlined in a form acceptable by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Types.  For the purpose of administering and enforcing this chapter,
there shall be two types of PUDs: residential and mixed-use.
      (1)   Residential PUD development requirements. The following standards
shall be used in designing and developing all residential PUDs:
         (a)   Residential PUDs shall be permissible on tracts of land of at
least five acres.
         (b)   Permissible types of residential uses within a residential PUD
shall be prescribed by the applicable PUD district ordinance as approved by the
Plan Commission and the Common Council.
         (c)   In any residential PUD, the minimum lot and setback requirements
of the initial zoning district may be reduced, provided that each lot is at
least 7,000 square feet with a minimum width of 60 feet. To the extent
practicable, all perimeter lots shall be sized and oriented so as to provide a
reasonable transition between the residential uses of the PUD and any adjacent
land uses.
         (d)   In the event that a residential PUD is to be located adjacent to
a single-family neighborhood, all two-family or multi-family portions of a
residential PUD should be located nearer the interior of the development rather
than the periphery of the tract.
      (2)   Mixed-use PUD development requirements.  The following standards
shall be followed in designing and developing all mixed-use PUDs:
         (a)   Mixed-use PUDs shall be permissible on tracts of land of at
least five acres.
         (b)   Permissible types of uses within a mixed-use PUD shall be
prescribed by the applicable PUD district ordinance as approved by the Plan
Commission.
         (c)   Within any tract of land developed as a mixed-use PUD, a minimum
of 50% of the buildable land shall be developed for single-family detached
dwellings. Not more than 30% of the buildable area may be developed for two-
family or multi-family dwellings. Not more than 20% of the total buildable area
may be developed for non -residential uses.
         (d)   The site development plans and construction plans for any
proposed mixed-use PUD shall indicate the particular portions of the tract that
the developer intends to develop for each use. One plan shall be approved for
the mixed-use PUD; however, for the purposes of determining the substantive
regulations that apply to the mixed-use PUD, each portion of the tract so
designated shall then be treated as if it were a separate district, zoned to
permit respectively higher density residential, lower density residential or
business uses.
         (e)   The non-residential portions) of any mixed-use PUD may not be
occupied until of the residential portions of the development are substantially
completed, unless a performance bond and/or maintenance guarantee are in
effect. The guarantee shall be done in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that the mixed
use PUD procedure is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create non-
residential uses in areas generally zoned for residential uses except as part
of an integrated and well-planned, mixed-use development.
   (C)   Application. The application for a PUD shall be submitted to the Plan
Commission on a form approved by the Plan Commission. This drawing shall
include details, as required by the Commission, including the location of
properties within 300 feet of the proposed PUD district boundary.
   (D)   PUD district ordinances. PUD district ordinances shall be adopted and
amended in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   The Common Council shall adopt and amend PUD district ordinances in
the same manner as a zone map change. Approval of the PUD district ordinance by
the Common Council shall constitute a zone map change to “PUD.” In the event
construction has not begun on the PUD within seven years from the date of PUD
district ordinance approval, the zoning shall revert to the previous zoning.
      (2)    A PUD district ordinance shall be expressed in either general
terms or detailed terms. At the initial public hearing, the Plan Commission
shall make a finding as to whether the PUD is expressed in either general or
detailed terms.
      (3)   If the PUD ordinance is expressed in detailed terms, a secondary
review of the PUD ordinance shall not be required, provided that the ordinance
specifies any and all plan documentation or supporting information that must be
supplied before an Improvement Location Permit for any structure within the PUD
district is issued, Secondary approval of a PUD ordinance shall also constitute
final plat approval.
      (4)   If the PUD district ordinance is expressed in general terms, a
secondary review of the PUD district ordinance, which shall specify any plan
documentation or supporting information that must be supplied in connection
with the secondary review, shall be required. Such documentation and supporting
information shall follow the following procedures:
         (a)   The Common Council hereby delegates authority to conduct
secondary review of all PUD district ordinances to the Plan Commission.
However, the Common Council reserves its right to modify the permitted uses or
development requirements of all PUD district ordinances at the time of the zone
map change. Such modification shall be conducted in an open Council meeting;
         (b)   The Plan Commission shall hear and consider all secondary
reviews during a public hearing;
         (c)   The approval of the secondary review shall be by an affirmative
vote of the Plan Commission. The disposition of the secondary review shall be
covered by the Plan Commission’s Rules of Procedure and adopted by resolution;
         (d)   If the secondary review is denied by the Plan Commission, the
applicant may appeal said decision to the Common Council. A written letter
requesting the appeal shall be delivered to the Plan Commission office within
ten days of the Plan Commissions decision. The Planning Director shall prepare
a council resolution affirming the Commission’s decision and forward it to the
Council. If the Council affirms the Commission’s denial, the Council’s decision
may be reviewed by certiorari.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.065 ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.
   The Director of Planning and Community Development ("Director") or an
authorized designee is hereby designated to enforce the terms and provisions of
this chapter as provided herein. As used herein, the term PLANNING DIRECTOR or
DIRECTOR shall be inclusive of an authorized designee.
   (A)   Complaints regarding violations. Whenever the Director receives a
complaint alleging a violation of this chapter or has reason to suspect that a
violation is occurring, the Director shall investigate the complaint or
suspicion and shall take whatever action is warranted in accordance with these
enforcement provisions.
   (B)   Persons liable. The owner or occupant of any building, structure, or
land, or part thereof, or other person who participates in, assists, directs,
creates, or maintains any condition that is contrary to the terms of this
chapter may be held responsible for the violation, suffer the penalties, and be
subject to the remedies provided herein and at law.
   (C)   Right of entry. The Director may enter upon any premises at any
reasonable time to inspect all buildings, structures, and premises within the
jurisdiction of this chapter to determine compliance with the provisions of
this chapter. All inspections shall be subject to the following standards and
conditions:
      (1)   The Director shall furnish to the owner, tenant, or occupant of the
building, structure, or premises sought to be inspected sufficient
identification and information to verify that the person is a representative of
the city and to identify the purpose of the inspection.
      (2)   If the owner, tenant, or occupant refuses to grant entry, the
Director may obtain the assistance of law enforcement and/or the courts for
securing entry.
   (D)   Procedures upon discovery of violations. If the Director determines
that any provision of this chapter is being violated, he shall provide a
written notice to correct to the persons responsible for the violation.
However, if the Director determines that corrective action is required
immediately, he may proceed with the appropriate action without first issuing a
notice to correct, as provided in division (D)(2) below.
      (1)   Notice to correct.
         (a)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, upon determining
that a violation of the terms of this chapter exists, the Director shall issue
to the person or persons responsible for the violation a written notice to
correct. The notice to correct shall be delivered by personal delivery,
certified mail return receipt requested, or regular U.S. Mail. Delivery by mail
shall be made to the owner of the property at the address of record at the
Office of the Montgomery County Auditor, and the owner shall be deemed to have
received notices mailed to that address. Delivery to any other person
responsible for the violation may be made to the address of the property at
issue. If delivery is made by mail, service shall be deemed to have been made
two days after the notice is placed in the mail.
         (b)   The notice to correct shall include the following information:
            1.   The date of the notice;
            2.   The name, business address, and phone number of the person
issuing the notice;
            3.   The name and address of the property owner and/or responsible
party;
            4.   The nature of the violation and the applicable section(s) of
this chapter;
            5.   The date the violation was observed;
            6.   The action necessary to correct the violation;
            7.   That if the violator does not correct the violation within ten
days he shall be subject to a fine citation and the remedies provided in this
section;
            8.   The schedule of fines that may be imposed if the violation is
not timely corrected, and an advisement that each day the condition remains
uncorrected after the time allowed constitutes a separate violation for which
an additional fine may be imposed;
            9.   That, if applicable, the violator may petition for an
appropriate development approval as provided in division (E) below;
            10.   That the violator may appeal the Director's determination
that a violation exists as provided in division (F) below.
         (c)   1.   After service of a notice to correct, the violator shall
have ten days to correct the condition. However, the Director may, in his
discretion, extend the time for correction if such a request is made by the
violator in writing and within the time originally allowed for correction. Such
a request shall be submitted to the Director and shall identify a proposed date
for completing the corrective action. If the Director denies the request, the
deadline contained in the notice to correct remains in effect.
            2.   Upon correcting the violation, the violator shall notify the
Director so that the Director may confirm that no further corrective action is
required.
         (d)   If the violation is not timely corrected, the violator shall be
subject to a fine citation and other remedies as provided herein.
         (e)   A person who receives a notice to correct may elect to file an
application for any available development approval, such as a request for a
variance or a special exception, seeking approval of the condition at issue.
The person must notify the Director of the intent to file such an application
within ten days after the date of service of the notice to correct. The
appropriate application must then be filed within 14 days, or before the next
application deadline, whichever is the greater time, unless additional time is
allowed by the Director. A person who timely files such an application or
petition shall diligently pursue the application or petition. While the
application or petition is pending, additional enforcement action shall be
stayed. If the application or petition is withdrawn, dismissed, or denied and
the violation remains uncorrected, the violator shall be subject to additional
enforcement, including issuance of a fine citation.
         (f)   Appeal of determination of violation.
            1.   The Director's determination that a violation exists may be
appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Such an appeal must be filed within
ten days after service of the notice to correct and as provided in division (I)
below.
            2.   While an appeal is pending, further enforcement action shall
be stayed.
            3.   If the appeal is withdrawn, dismissed, or denied and the
violation remains uncorrected, the violator shall have ten days from the
withdrawal, dismissal or denial to correct the violation, unless additional
time is allowed as provided in division (D)(1)(c) above. Failure to correct
within this time shall subject the violator to a citation and all available
remedies.
            4.   Failure to file an appeal within the time provided herein
shall operate as a waiver of such an appeal. The waiver is limited to the
determination of a violation, and does not preclude any available appeal of
further action relating to the violation.
      (2)   Enforcement without prior written notice to correct. In cases where
delay would prevent the effective enforcement of this section or would pose a
danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the Director may seek
enforcement by invoking any penalties or remedies authorized herein or by law
without first issuing a written notice to correct. Those remedies can include,
but may not be limited to, a stop work order and/or a fine citation.
   (E)   Fine citation. If a violation identified in a notice to correct is not
timely corrected, the Director may issue a fine citation to the violator. When
a citation is issued, fines shall be imposed beginning the day the citation is
issued and shall continue accruing daily thereafter, without further notice,
until the condition is corrected. Each day a violation remains uncorrected
after issuance of a citation results in an additional fine without any further
notices to correct or citations.
      (1)   Service of the citation. A citation shall be delivered in the same
manner as provided in division (D)(1)(a). If delivery made by mail, service
shall be deemed to have been made two days after the citation is placed the
mail.
      (2)   Content of citation. The citation shall contain the following
information:
         (a)   The date of the citation;
         (b)   The name, business address, and phone number of the person
issuing the citation;
         (c)   The address of the property at issue;
         (d)   The name and address of the property owner and/or other
responsible party;
         (e)   The nature of the violation and the applicable section(s) of
this chapter;
         (f)   The action necessary to correct the violation;
         (g)   The first date for which a fine is imposed;
         (h)   That each day the violation remains uncorrected constitutes a
violation for which a separate fine will be assessed, without further notice or
citation;
         (i)   The amount of the fine(s) imposed; and
         (j)   An advisement of the right to appeal the fine.
      (3)   Fine schedule.
         (a)   First occurrence of violation. The monetary fine for the first
occurrence of a violation shall be $100 per day.
         (b)   Recurring violation(s). For any recurrence of violation within a
365-day period after correction of the first occurrence, the following fines
shall apply for each day the recurrence remains uncorrected:
            1.   Second occurrence: $200.
            2.   Third occurrence: $400.
            3.   Fourth occurrence: $600.
            4.   Fifth occurrence: $1,000.
            5.   Each occurrence in excess of five: $2,500.
         (c)   Each day a violation remains uncorrected shall be a distinct and
separate violation and subject to an additional fine, in the amounts provided
above, without further notice or citation.
         (d)   Waiver or reduction of fines. In his discretion and for good
cause, the Director may waive or reduce fines upon correction of a violation.
      (4)   Payment, adjudication, and appeal.
         (a)   A person to whom a citation is issued may elect to do one of the
following:
            1.   Pay all fines due to the City Clerk-Treasurer within 30 days
of the citation.
            2.   File an appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in
division (I) below. Such an appeal is limited to the amount of the fine
assessed. While the appeal is pending, further enforcement action and further
fines shall be stayed.
            3.   Stand trial for the citation by notifying the Director of such
intent, in writing, within ten days after issuance of the citation.
               a.   Upon receipt of a notice of intention to stand trial,
additional fines shall be stayed pending resolution of the alleged violation.
               b.   Upon receipt of a notice of intention to stand trial, the
Director shall initiate appropriate action to enforce the citation in court.
               c.   If the court determines that the condition is not a
violation or if the case is dismissed, no fines are owed. If the court affirms
the alleged violation, fines resume accruing the day following the court
decision or dismissal.
         (b)   If the violator neither timely pays all amounts due under a
citation, files an appeal with the BZA, nor elects to stand trial, the Director
may commence an enforcement action in court.
      (5)   Other remedies reserved.
         (a)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this section does not
preclude the Zoning Director, the city, the Plan Commission, or the Board of
Zoning Appeals from seeking alternative and additional relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction or as otherwise provided by law or by this section.
         (B)   Pursuant to IC 36-1-6-2, if a condition exists on real property
in violation of this chapter, the Director, or other representatives or
contractors of the city, may enter onto the properly and take the appropriate
action to bring the property into compliance. However, before such action may
be taken, the Director shall provide notice to all persons holding a
substantial interest in the property of his intention and shall provide such
persons a reasonable time of at least ten days to bring the properly into
compliance. If the city is required to take action under this section, the
expenses incurred by the city to obtain compliance may be collected from the
owner or other responsible party and shall constitute a lien against the
property.
   (F)   Stop work order.
      (1)   The Director may issue a stop work order requiring the immediate
suspension of land improvements whenever any of the following circumstances
exist:
         (a)   A site is being improved without a building permit, certificate
of occupancy, improvement location permit, or any other permit required by this
chapter; or
         (b)   A site is being improved in violation of:
            1.   The terms, conditions, or provisions of this chapter;
            2.   The terms, conditions, or commitments of a variance, special
exception, development plan, planned unit development, or zone map amendment;
or
            3.   Any other development approval granted under this chapter.
      (2)   The following procedures apply to the Director's issuance of a stop
work order:
         (a)   The stop work order shall:
            1.   Be posted on the property in a conspicuous place or personally
delivered to the owner, tenant, occupant, or person in charge;
            2.   Identify the violation(s) on which it is based and the
corrective action required;
            3.   Identify the conditions under which construction or other
activity may resume; and
            4.   Inform the recipient of his right to appeal the order.
         (b)   The recipient of a stop work order may appeal the decision of
the Director to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with division (I)
below.
         (c)   The Director may bring an action in court to enforce the
provisions of a stop work order.
         (d)   Violation of a stop work order shall also be considered a
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to enforcement and penalties as
contained herein.
   (G)   Revocation of prior development approval.
      (1)   Authority.
         (a)   The Director may, in accordance with this section, seek the
revocation of any development approval previously granted either
administratively or by any city board, commission, or committee under this
chapter, including but not limited to any improvement location permit,
certificate of occupancy, sign permit, development plan approval, variance, or
special exception if:
            1.   The approval was obtained without adhering, to the applicable
procedures of this chapter, including but not limited to:
               a.   Failure to properly notify other property owners as
required; or
               b.   Failure to demonstrate consent of property owners as
required;
            2.   The approval was obtained on the basis of factual errors in
the application or supporting materials;
            3.   The approval was obtained on the basis of falsified
information; or
            4.   The recipient of the approval fails to develop or maintain the
property in accordance with the application and plans submitted, the
requirements of this chapter, or any additional requirements imposed in
connection with the approval.
         (b)   Any development approval granted administratively, rather than
by the Plan Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals, may be revoked by the Zoning
Director. Any development approval granted by the Plan Commission or Board of
Zoning Appeals can be revoked only by whichever of those bodies granted the
approval.
      (2)   Procedure for revocation by approving body.
         (a)   Notice of intent to revoke.
            1.   If the Director intends to seek the revocation of an approval
previously granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Plan Commission, he
shall deliver to the holder of the approval a written notice of intent to
revoke. The notice of intent to revoke shall identify the reason(s) , for the
revocation and shall identify the date and time at which the Board or
Commission will decide the issue, as provided herein.
            2.   The notice of intent to revoke shall be delivered by personal
delivery, certified mail return receipt requested, or regular U.S. Mail to the
holder of the permit or approval at issue. If delivery is made by mail, service
shall be deemed to have been made two days after the notice is placed in the
mail.
         (b)   Hearing. If the approval sought to be revoked originally
required a public hearing, then the appropriate Board or Commission shall
conduct a public hearing on the proposed revocation. If the approval did not
require a public hearing, a public hearing is not required on the revocation.
The meeting or public hearing of the appropriate Board or Commission shall be
held not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice of intent to revoke.
Notice of the meeting or public hearing shall be provided to the public and/or
surrounding property owners in the same manner as would be required for an
original petition for the approval at issue.
         (c)   Decision. At the close of its consideration of the proposed
revocation, the Board or Commission shall render its decision. The Board or
Commission shall also enter written findings of fact supporting the decision.
The Director shall provide a copy of the decision to the approval holder within
ten days of the decision.
      (3)   Procedure for administrative revocation. The Director may revoke
any approval granted administratively, as set forth above, as follows:
         (a)   If the Director determines a development approval which was
granted administratively should be revoked, he shall deliver to the holder of
the approval or permit a written notice of the revocation. The notice shall
identify the reason(s) for the revocation and shall advise the recipient of the
right to seek review of the decision by submitting an appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals as provided in division (I) below. This notice shall be
delivered in the same manner as provided in division (G)(2)(a) above.
      (4)   Result of revocation. No person may continue to make use of land or
buildings in the manner authorized by any approval or permit after the approval
or permit has been revoked as provided herein.
      (5)   Records. A record of all written correspondence, notices, and
decisions concerning the revocation of any prior approval shall be kept with
the original development file.
   (H)   Common nuisance. Pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1012, any structure, land, or
premises found to be in violation of this chapter is hereby declared to be a
common nuisance. In addition to any other fine or civil penalty, any owner or
possessor of the structure, land, or premises may be liable for maintaining a
common nuisance.
   (I)   Appeals of Director decisions.
      (1)   Except as may be otherwise provided in this section all decisions
of the Director may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with the procedures and standards for appeals of administrative decisions.
      (2)   Decisions of any board or commission acting under this section may
be appealed by a request for judicial review under IC 36-7-4-1600 et seq.
   (J)   Costs and legal fees. The violator, or other person or entity subject
to an enforcement action as provided herein, shall be liable for the city's
costs of enforcement, including any court costs and reasonable attorney fees.
   (K)   Private remedies reserved. The terms of this section shall not be
interpreted to prevent any person entitled to relief in law or equity due to a
violation of this chapter from bringing an appropriate action to secure relief.

§ 153.071 LOT AND YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Number of buildings per lot. In any district, not more than one
principal structure and its customary accessory uses shall be located on a
single lot of record, with the exception of principal structures designed and
platted as a single unit under single ownership of control, such as a multi-
family residential project, a shopping center, or combined industrial
operations.
   (B)   Corner lots. On a comer lot, the front lot line shall be the lot line
having the shortest dimension along the street right-of-way. The required front
yard setback shall apply to each yard that abuts a thoroughfare.
   (C)   Yard encroachments. No portion of a principal structure, whether open
or enclosed, including garages, porches, carports, balconies, roofs, or
platforms above normal grade level, shall project into any minimum front, side
or rear yard. Accessory structures may not be located closer than five feet to
the side and rear property lines in any district.
   (D)   Vision clearance areas. No structure or improvement, including
landscaping or signs, shall be erected, placed, planted, allowed to grow, or
maintained so as to interfere with a vision clearance area between a height of
three feet and ten feet above the center line grades of the intersecting
street, driveway, or alley. A vision clearance area shall be established for
all streets, whether public or private, in one of the following manners.
      (1)   Corner Lots. The clear sight triangular area is formed by the
street right-of-way lines and the line connecting points 25 feet from the
intersection of such streets right-of-way lines, or in case of a round or cut
property comer, from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines
extended; or
      (2)   Lots adjacent to a railroad crossing. The clear sight triangular
area is formed by the side lot line coterminous with the railroad right-of-way,
the street right-of-way line, and the line connecting points 25 feet from the
intersection of such lines; or
      (3)   Lots with a driveway, abutting an alley or driveway. The two clear
sight triangular areas are formed by the street right-of-way line, both sides

the line connecting points ten feet from the intersection of the street right-
of-way line and driveway or alley lines extended.
   (E)   Side and rear yard requirements for non-residential uses abutting
residential districts.  Non- residential buildings or uses shall not be located
nor conducted closer than 40 feet to any lot line of a residential district
except that the minimum yard requirements may be reduced to 50% of the
requirement if acceptable landscaping or screening, which must be approved by
the Planning Director, is provided. Such screening shall be a masonry or solid
fence between four and eight feet in height, maintained in good condition and
free of all advertising or other signs; adequate landscaping; or a combination
of fence and landscaping planted on the residential side of the fence.
Landscaping provided in lieu of a wall or fence shall consist of a strip of
land not less than 20 feet in width planted with an evergreen hedge or dense
planting or evergreen shrubs not less than four feet in height at the time of
planting. In order not to obscure traffic visibility either type of screening
shall not exceed three feet in height in any required front yard setback for
the abutting residential district. When used in combination, the width of the
required landscaping buffer and the number of plantings may be reduced by half,
provided the fence is opaque (solid) and constructed of a material that is
compatible with the principle non-residential building/use.

§ 153.130 EXPIRATION OF PETITIONS AND PERMITS.
   (A)   General. All required petitions and permits established in this
chapter shall expire one year after the issuance of such petitions or permits
if:
      (1)   The use of land authorized by such petition or permit has not
commenced in circumstances where no substantial construction, erection,
alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is necessary; or
      (2)   Less than 75% of the total cost of all construction, erection,
alteration, excavation, demolition, materials or similar work on any
development authorized by such petition or permit has been completed on the
site.
   (B)   Failure to complete construction. If, after the fulfillment of either
division (A)(1) or (2), such work is not completed within one year from the
issuance of the permit, then the permit authorizing such work shall expire.
   (C)   Extensions. The Planning Director may extend a petition or permit for
a period up to six months the date when a petition or permit would otherwise
expire pursuant to divisions (A) or (B) above, if:
      (1)   The owner has requested the extension in writing from the issuing
authority; and
      (2)   The petition or permit has not yet expired; and
      (3)   The owner has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith; and
      (4)   Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new

permit, provided that said permit has not already expired.
   (E)   Time of issuance. For purposes of this section, approval of a petition
within the jurisdiction of the City Council, the Plan Commission, Plat

(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.131 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
   (A)   General. Subject to division (B) below, all petitions and permits are
transferable, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered
under a petition or permit continues to be used for the express purposes for
which the petition or permit was granted. The terms and requirements of the
petition or permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered
under the petition or permit, not only with respect to all persons having any
interest in the property at the time the petition or permit was obtained, but
also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or
part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with
purposes other than those for which the petition or permit was originally
issued.
   (B)   Petitions not transferable. Home occupation special exception
petitions, use variance petitions and their related ILPs are not transferable.
Any continuance of these petitions shall require a new petition approved by the
BZA. The BZA, at their sole discretion, may also stipulate that any petition or
permit is not transferable where situations warrant it.
   (C)   Recording and required fee. Whenever a petition or permit is issued
that is not transferable, the following shall apply:
      (1)   Nothing authorized by the petition or permit may be started until a
document stating such petition or permit is not transferable is recorded in the
Montgomery County Recorder’s office and indexed under the record owner’s name
as grantor.
      (2)   The petitioner shall be required to pay the Plan Commission office
an additional fee to have the document recorded.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)
§ 153.132 AMENDMENTS TO ZONING CODE AND ZONING MAP.
   (A)   General. Two procedures to amend this chapter and one procedure to
amend the zoning maps are established, as follows:
      (1)   Petitions requesting a total replacement or a total repeal to this
chapter, including amendments and zoning maps, may only be initiated by the
Plan Commission. The procedure for this type of petition shall be governed by
I.C. 36-7-4-602(a) and 36-7-4-606.
      (2)   Petitions requesting an amendment or repeal to part of the text of
this chapter may only be initiated by the Plan Commission or the Common
Council. The procedure for this type of petition shall be governed by I.C. 36-
7-4-602 (b) and 36-7-4-607.
      (3)   Petitions requesting a change to the zoning maps (rezoning) may
only be initiated by the Plan Commission, the Common Council or by a petition
signed by property owners who own at least 50% of the land involved. The
procedure for this type of petition shall be governed by I.C. 36-7-4-602 (c)
and 36-7-4-608.
   (B)   Rezoning application process. The petition process for a rezoning
initiated by a majority of property owners is as follows:
      (1)   A rezoning shall be applied for in writing on a form provided by
the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Every petition for a rezoning shall be accompanied by the
following:
         (a)   All applicable fees, as established in the city official fee
schedule;
         (b)   A list of affected parties;
         (c)   A legal description of the property; and
         (d)   A site plan, drawn to scale, and on paper not less than 17 inch
x 21 inch nor more than 30 inch x 36 inch, showing the location of the proposed
land to be rezoned in respect to surrounding properties. This drawing shall
include details, as required by the Commission, of the land uses within 300
feet of the land to be rezoned.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall hear and determine all rezoning petitions
during a public hearing.
      (4)   The disposition of the rezoning shall be by an affirmative vote of
the Commission and shall be covered by Commission Rules of Procedure adopted by
resolution.
   (C)   Rezoning findings of fact.  All rezoning must be recommended to the
Council only upon a determination in writing that the Plan Commission has
considered the following:
      (1)   Whether the rezoning will fulfill a public need for that type of
land use.
      (2)   Whether the rezoning is appropriate in the area requested or if the
public interest would be better served by rezoning another area of the
jurisdiction.
      (3)   Whether the rezoning conforms to the future land use map in the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (4)   Whether the new land use will complement the present and future
traffic flows or would the rezoning cause an adverse impact.
      (5)   Whether adequate off street parking will be provided if the
rezoning request is granted.
      (6)   Whether potential inconveniences and nuisances (such as noise,
lights, odors, and the like) of the rezoning request on adjacent landowners
have been adequately considered.
      (7)   Whether there are adequate public utilities and services available
to the land if rezoned; and whether the local government will have to pay the
cost of any such installation.
      (8)   Whether it is assured that the rezoning request is not spot zoning,
a violation of precedents, or arbitrary and capricious.
   (D)   Council action required. Once the Commission gives a recommendation on
a rezoning, it must certify its recommendation to the Council within ten days
of such decision. The Council has ninety days from the date the Commission
certifies its recommendation in which to take final action on the proposal.
Final action shall be the adoption, or rejection of a prepared ordinance;
however, if the Council fails to take final action or act on the proposal
within such 90-day period, the proposal shall be approved as certified by the
Plan Commission.
   (E)   Speculative rezoning prohibited. In all cases where a rezoning is
initiated by a majority of property owners, the petition shall be requested
because of a committed and planned project. The Plan Commission shall consider
the criteria in division (C) above based upon the planned project. All such
rezoning petitions where there is no commitment and/or planned project shall be
considered speculative and shall be prohibited.
   (F)   Permits for projects where a rezoning was requested and granted. In
cases where a rezoning is initiated by a majority of property owners, and where
an ILP or building permit is requested for a project which is inconsistent with
the findings of the approved rezoning, the ILP or building permit shall be
denied by the Planning Director.
(Ord. 4-2009, passed 3-9-09)

§ 154.05 HISTORIC DISTRICTS AND GUIDELINES.
   (A)   City Council approval of maps of historic districts. Before a historic
district is established and the building classifications take effect, the map
described in §
154.04(B), setting forth the historic district boundaries and building
classifications, must be submitted by the Commission to, and approved in an
ordinance by, the City Council.
   (B)   In an ordinance approving the establishment of a historic district,
the City Council may provide that the establishment shall occur in two phases.
During the first phase, which continues for a period of three years from the
date the ordinance is adopted, a certificate of appropriateness is required
only for the following activities: the demolition of any building; the moving
of any building; and any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way. At the end of the
first phase, the district becomes fully established, and, subject to §
154.05(C), a certificate of appropriateness must be issued by the Commission
before a permit may be issued for or work may begin on an activity described in
this chapter.
   (C)   (1)   The first phase described in §
154.05(B) continues and the second phase does not become effective if a
majority of the property owners in the district object to the Commission, in
writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness be issued for
the following activities:
         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color change;
         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and fences
along public ways;
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of nonhistoric
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (2)   The objections must be received by the Commission not earlier
than180 days or later than 60 days before the third anniversary of the adoption
of the ordinance.
   (D)   In an ordinance approving the establishment of a historic district,
the City Council may exclude changes in paint colors from the activities
requiring the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness under §
154.07 of this ordinance before a permit may be issued or work begun.
   (E)   The map establishing boundaries of a historic district may be recorded
in the Office of the Montgomery County Recorder.
(Ord. 9-2022, passed 6-13-22)
§ 154.06 INTERIM PROTECTION.
   (A)   When submitting a map to the City Council to create a historic
district under this chapter, the Commission may declare one or more buildings
or structures that are classified and designated as historic on the map to be
under interim protection.
   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building or structure
to be under interim protection under this section, the Commission shall, by
personal delivery or first-class mail, provide the owner or occupant of the
building or structure with a written notice of the declaration. The written
notice must:
      (1)   Cite the authority of the Commission to put the building or
structure under interim protection under this section;
      (2)   Explain the effect of putting the building or structure under
interim protection; and
      (3)   Indicate that the interim protection is temporary.
   (C)   A building or structure put under interim protection under §
154.06(A) remains under interim protection until the map is:
      (1)   Submitted to; and
      (2)   Approved in an ordinance or rejected by the City Council.
   (D)   While a building or structure is under interim protection:
      (1)   The building or structure may not be demolished or moved; and
      (2)   The exterior appearance of the building or structure may not be
conspicuously changed by:
         (a)   Addition;
         (b)   Reconstruction; or
         (c)   Alteration.
(Ord. 9-2022, passed 6-13-22)
§ 154.07 CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificates of appropriateness required. A certificate of
appropriateness must be issued by or on behalf of the Commission before a
permit is issued for or work is begun on any of the following:
      (1)   Within all areas of a historic district;
         (a)   The demolition of any building;
         (b)   The moving of any building;
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color change; or
         (d)   Any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.
      (2)   Within a primary area of a historic district:
         (a)   A change in walls and fences or the construction of walls and
fences along public ways; or
         (b)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of nonhistoric
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (3)   Within the first phase of a two-phase establishment of a historic
district:
         (a)   The moving of any building;
         (b)   The demolition of any building; or
         (c)   Any new construction of a principal building or accessory
building or structure subject to view from a public way.
   (B)   Application for certificates of appropriateness. Application for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be made in the office of the Commission on
forms provided by that office. Detailed drawings, plans, or specifications are
not required. However, to the extent reasonably required for the Commission to
make a decision, each application must be accompanied by sketches, drawings,
photographs, descriptions, or other information showing the proposed exterior
alterations, additions, changes, or new construction.
   (C)   Approval or denial of certificates of appropriateness. The Commission
may advise and make recommendations to the applicant before acting on an
application for a certificate of appropriateness. If an application for a
certificate of appropriateness is approved by the Commission, or is not acted
on by the Commission, within 30 days after it is filed, a certificate of
appropriateness shall be issued. If the certificate is issued, the application
shall be processed in the same manner as applications for building or
demolition permits required by the city, if any, are processed. If no building
or demolition permits are required by the city, the applicant may proceed with
the work authorized by the certificate. If the Commission denies an application
for a certificate of appropriateness within 30 days after it is filed, the
certificate may not be issued. The Commission must state its reasons for the
denial in writing and must advise the applicant. An application that has been
denied may not be processed as an application for a building or demolition
permit and does not authorize any work by the applicant. The Commission may
grant an extension of the 30-day limit if the applicant agrees to it.
   (D)   Criteria for considering effect of actions on historic buildings. The
Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any reconstruction,
alteration, maintenance, or moving of a historic building or any part of or
appurtenance to such building, including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps,
paving, and signs shall require that such work be done in a manner that will
preserve the historical and architectural character of the building, structure,
or appurtenance. In considering historic and architectural character, the
Commission shall consider, among other things, the following:
      (1)   Purposes of this chapter;
      (2)   Historical and architectural value and significance of the
building, structure, site or appurtenance;
      (3)   Compatibility and significance of additions, alterations, details,
materials, or other non-original elements which may be of a different style and
construction date than the original;
      (4)   The texture, material, color, style, and detailing of the building,
structure, site or appurtenance;
      (5)   The continued preservation and protection of original or otherwise
significant structure, material, and ornamentation;
      (6)   The relationship of buildings, structures, appurtenances, or
architectural features similar to one within the same historic district,
including for primary areas, visual compatibility as defined in §
154.09(B); and,
      (7)   The position of the building or structure in relation to the
street, public right-of-way and to other buildings and structures.
   (E)   Procedure for demolition upon denial of a certificate of
appropriateness. The purpose of this section is to preserve historic buildings
that are important to the education, culture, traditions, and economic values
of the city, and to afford the city, historical organizations, and other
interested persons the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the
preservation of these buildings. If a property owner demonstrates that a
historic building is incapable of earning an economic return on its value, as
appraised by a qualified real estate appraiser, and the Commission fails to
approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the building may be
demolished. However, before a demolition permit is issued or demolition
proceeds, the following requirements for notice must be met:
      (1)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed
by the Commission, based on the Commission's classification on the approved
map, but not less than 60 days nor more than one year.
      (2)   Notice must be posted on the premises of the building proposed for
demolition in a location clearly visible from the street.
      (3)   Notice must be published in a newspaper of general local
circulation at least three times before demolition, with the first publication
not more than 15 days after the application for a permit to demolish is filed,
and the final pubheation at least 15 days before the date of the permit.
   (F)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any
time during the notice period under §
154.07(E). If the certificate is approved, a demolition permit shall be issued
without further delay, and demolition may proceed.

visual compatibility of the building to the buildings, squares, and places to
which it is visually related.
      (10)   Scale of a building. The size of a building, and the building mass
of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches, and
balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings, squares, and places
to which it is visually related.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Crawfordsville does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the City of Crawfordsville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K) Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)
§ 156.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)

of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD OR FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in
the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of collective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of
Crawfordsville Common Council requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secreta,y of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by:
         (a)   An approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
Interior, or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of lnterior in states without approved
programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD).  A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood st11dy to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR) means FEMA's comment on
a proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F) means a
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-:F).   FEMA 's
modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill
outside the existing regulatory floodway.

either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.

another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)
§ 156.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR- FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.

injury of others;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transpmi of the floodwaters at tl1e site; and,
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
156.05.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
156.45(A), (C)(1) or (D) of this chapter may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §

regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of §§
156.45 through
156.49 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic
structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance

variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 4-10-23)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 156.45 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (Riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
156.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions to the
requirements of the Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to
qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential structures,
rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings,
outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
156.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (IC 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The Floodplain
Development Permit shall meet the provisions contained in this article.
      (3)   The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
156.29(A). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing
the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (Riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in this article have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Depa1tment of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.
