§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   (A)   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as
revised, codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component
codes, titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“Cloverdale Town Code”, for which designation the following may be substituted:
      (1)   “Code of ordinances”;
      (2)   “Codified ordinances”; or
      (3)   “Code”.
   (B)   Code title, chapter, and section headings do not constitute any part
of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted, amending, or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law, or amendment
thereto, reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to the
various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as originally
enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by the
compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official publication,
to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings are for
organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application, or
construction of the law they precede. Each note following a section of this
code is for reference purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise

and inseparably connected with and so dependent upon the invalid provision or

entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or

CAPITAL ASSETS
§ 33.095 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   The purpose of this policy is to establish a procedure for the
classification of capital assets, including fixed assets and infrastructure,
for accuracy in financial reporting through the State Board of Accounts and to
fix the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on the town’s financial
reports. The issuance of a policy document is related to the implementation of
a new reporting mode, Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. The
capital asset threshold will be $5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will
be expensed in the year of purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy
is also effective January 1, 2017.
   (B)   The town has established a capital asset policy in order to provide a
higher degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets,
and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies.
   (C)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold to:
      (1)   Safeguard the investments of the citizens of the town;
      (2)   Fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   Provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance, and retirement policies;
      (4)   Provide data for financial reporting; and
      (5)   Demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (D)   This policy is intended to classify capital assets, including fixed
assets and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the

include data processing programs, software programming, or computer operations
procedures.

$5,000.
   (C)   Exceptions are:

larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units; and
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
   (D)   This policy is intended to classify capital assets, including fixed
assets and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
State Board of Accounts. For purposes of this subchapter, capital assets do not
include data processing programs, software programming, or computer operations
procedures.

§ 33.099 ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
Additionally, it is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each
asset category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for
records maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system. This section
further clarifies the asset definition by major category.
   BUILDINGS. All structures designed and erected to house equipment or to
provide space for the provision of services or the completion of municipal
functions are included. This would also include fixtures within BUILDINGS and
attachments to BUILDINGS such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, and flagpoles. Plumbing systems, lighting systems,
heating, cooling, ventilation and air handling systems, alarm systems,
surveillance systems, passenger and freight elevators, escalators, build-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed

lots, or any other property used in association with buildings.
      (2)   Additions and improvements to INFRASTRUCTURE, which increase the

§ 50.05 ADJUSTMENT TO UTILITY CHARGES.
   The following shall apply to the adjustment to water and sewer charges.
   (A)   Any person disputing the accuracy of a particular bill must request an
adjustment from the Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee (which designee may
include, but is not limited to, the Town Manager) within 25 days of the
issuance of the bill. The Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee shall have the
authority to correct billing errors subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   If a test of the meter involved demonstrates that there is an error
in the meters functioning, an adjustment shall be made to the metered water use
and any sewer charge based upon a metered rate.
         (a)   The adjustment shall be based on average metered use for the
three months prior to the month in which the meter is determined to be in
error. Provided that the prior three months were months with an active
connection and the building was subject to the same or similar occupancy.
         (b)   In the event that the building was not subject to the same or
similar occupancy, then the adjustment will be based upon average usage by
structures that have similar occupancy as the structure in question.
      (2)   In the event that a water leak occurs in a manner that the water
does not enter the sanitary sewer system, there will be no adjustment to the
water bill based upon the metered rate (see division (B) below). Any sewer bill
based upon a metered rate will be adjusted as provided below.
         (a)   The sewer bill for the month in question will be based upon the
average water consumption rate for the three months prior to the month in which
the leak occurred.
         (b)   There must be clear evidence that the water leak did not enter
the sanitary sewer system. In the event that it cannot be determined whether or
not the leaked water entered the sanitary sewer system, the full sewer bill
must be paid.
   (B)   Because any water lost in a water leak was treated and pumped at the
expense of the town’s water utility, adjustments to water bills for leaks are
not generally allowed.
   (C)   Reductions to a utility bill, as determined by the Clerk-Treasurer or
his or her designee, are only allowed once per calendar year per connection.
   (D)   Adjustments by the Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee are limited
to the conditions above and, in addition, may not exceed $500 per adjustment.
Any adjustment that the Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee determines is
appropriate that is in excess of this limit will be submitted directly to the
Town Council for final approval before being credited to the account.
   (E)   The Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee will make his or her
decision within ten days of the receipt of the written request for an
adjustment.
   (F)   Any person who, having filed a request for an adjustment with the
Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee and is dissatisfied with the
determination made by that individual may appeal that determination by filing a
written request for a hearing before the Town Council. The request for a
hearing must be filed within 15 days of the determination. The Town Council
will consider the appeal at its next regular Council meeting.

§ 50.48 FINAL DISCONNECTION; DEPOSIT.
   Upon final move out and/or final disconnection of services, the $200 deposit
paid to have the service connected can either be refunded, applied to the final
balance, or transferred to a new account.
   (A)   Refunding.
      (1)   In order for the customer to receive the full $200 deposit refund,
the account balance must be paid in full, including the final bill for the
account.
      (2)   Contract buyers will be refunded the full $200 deposit upon final
purchase/fulfillment of contract.
   (B)   Applying.
      (1)   If the customer chooses to apply his or her deposit to his or her
final balance, then the office will do so. If the final balance is more than
the $200 deposit, the customer will still owe the remaining final balance.
      (2)   If the customer agrees to apply his or her deposit to his or her
final balance and the final balance is less than the total $200 deposit, the
remaining amount can be refunded to the customer.
      (3)   Renter deposits will be applied first to the water portion of the
balance owed with the remainder being applied to the wastewater/stormwater
portion of the bill.
   (C)   Transferring. A deposit can only be transferred from a finalized
account to a current account. If a renting customer has already paid a deposit
on one account and is opening another, another deposit must be paid for the new
account. If the customer is finalizing one account and opening another and
would like to transfer his or her deposit from his or her old account to the
new account, this can be done as long as his or her first account (if
finalized) is paid in full.
   (D)   Leaks/adjustments. In the event a customer has a reported water leak,
town utilities will provide an adjustment to the sewer portion of the utility
bill. All adjustments will follow guidelines stated within §
50.05. Owners and/or tenants must provide documentation of the location and
repair of the leak. Absolutely no adjustments will be made to the water portion
of the utility bill. Customers have the right to appeal to the Town Council at
the monthly Town Council meeting. Customers must provide a written statement
seven days prior to the meeting.

§ 52.032 SURCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the town shall impose, in addition to the
charge based upon volume, a surcharge based upon the strength and character of
the sewage and waste which it is required to treat and dispose of. The town
shall have the right to measure and determine, or cause to be measured and
determined, the strength and content of all sewage and waste discharged either
directly or indirectly into the town’s sanitary sewage system in such manner
and by such methods as may be deemed practical in the light of the conditions
and attending circumstances in order to determine the proper charge. Any and
all commercial and industrial installations having an effluent discharge into
the town’s sewers with an average BOD (biological oxygen demand) exceeding 200
parts per million concentration and/or an average daily suspended solids
exceeding 250 parts per million concentration shall be deemed to be discharging
sewage of such strength as to require a surcharge for the treatment and
disposal thereof. The town is authorized to prohibit the dumping of waste into
the town’s sewage system, which, in the town’s discretion are deemed harmful to
the operation of the sewage treatment works of said town and is further
authorized to require methods of pretreatment of said wastes to reduce the
harmful characteristics of the waste prior to discharge thereof into the town’s
system.
   (B)   (1)   The surcharge to be imposed by the town for the treatment of
such waste shall be based upon the following formula:
 
Surcharge = (B O (BOD 5 - B a + S O (SS - S a ) x (8.34 x V))
 
      (2)   For the purposes of the foregoing formula, the following
definitions shall apply:
         (a)   B O : Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to BOD, dollars
per pound;
         (b)   BOD 5 : the concentration of BOD 5 in the wastewater from a
specific user, parts per million;
         (c)   B a : maximum concentration of BOD 5 in parts per million which
can be discharged into the town’s collection system without a surcharge - 200
parts per million;
         (d)   S O : average unit cost of treatment (including sludge
treatment) chargeable to suspend solids, dollars per pound;
         (e)   SS: the concentration of suspended solids in the wastewater from
a specific user;
         (f)   S a : maximum concentration of suspended solids in parts per
million which can be discharged into the town’s collection system without a
surcharge equals 250 parts per million; and
         (g)   V: volume in thousand gallons.
      (3)   The town shall, for the purpose of computing said surcharge,
periodically determine the average cost of treatment chargeable to BOD in terms
of dollars per pound (B O ) and the average unit cost of treatment including
sludge treatment chargeable to suspended solids in terms of dollars per pound
(SO). At this time, the average cost of treatment of BOD has been determined to
be $1.30 per pound and suspended solids, $1.12 per pound.
      (4)   The surcharge herein imposed shall be reviewed annually after the
effective date of this subchapter and the required adjustments made to maintain
the equity of charges to various classes of users.
      (5)   A flat rate of $30 per 500 gallons will be charged to septic tank
waste delivered to the wastewater treatment plant for treatment and disposal.
(Prior Code, § 9-27) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)
§ 52.033 COLLECTION RECORDS.
   (A)   The rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the town and
shall be collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance. Said rates and
charges will be billed to the tenant or tenant occupying the property served,
unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but such billing shall in
no way relieve the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as
herein required. The owners of the property served, which are occupied by
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the town for
the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid by
such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made in the office in
which said records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for
business.
   (B)   (1)   All billings and charges shall become due the fifteenth of every
month.
      (2)   For purposes of verifying reports submitted by industrial or high
strength users, the town may collect and analyze samples of waste at any time
and as frequently as deemed necessary.
      (3)   A delinquent fee of 10% shall be added to all current charges if
not paid by the fifteenth of each month.
(Prior Code, § 9-28) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)
§ 52.034 BYLAWS AND REGULATIONS.
   The town shall make and enforce such bylaws and regulations as may be deemed
necessary for the safe, economic, and efficient management of the town’s sewage
works, including the sewer system and the treatment plant for the construction
and use of house sewers and connections to the sewer system, and for the
regulation, collection, rebating, and refunding of rates and charges.
(Prior Code, § 9-29) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)

premises thereafter served, without the necessity of any notice of hearing.
(Prior Code, § 9-30) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)
§ 52.036 INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   (A)   Every industrial user or user whose discharge is of a strength in
excess of normal domestic sewage shall submit to the town periodic reports
containing characteristics of the user’s waste discharge. Unless the town
requires more frequent reports, the user shall submit within 30 days after the
close of a calendar quarter the report for the calendar quarter. The town shall
specify the form and content of the report to each user.
   (B)   For purposes of verifying reports submitted by industrial or high
strength users, the town may collect and analyze samples of waste at any time
and as frequently as deemed necessary.
   (C)   In the case of a potential industry applying for connection to the
town’s sewage works, the town shall require a report from such potential user
which shall set forth the anticipated BOD, suspended solids, and flow of the
user’s waste.
(Prior Code, § 9-31) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.037 CLASSES OF SEWAGE USAGE.
   At the time of the adoption of this subchapter, the town has classified all
users as being of one class. On the basis of strength of usage, it is
determined that there are no industrial users of the sewage works and on the
basis of there being only a small number of commercial users, and those having
wastes of the same character as normal domestic sewage, it is determined that
for user charge purposes, only one class of user is practical. At such time as
different classes of users can be clearly defined, user charges shall be
determined for each class of user by allocating the annual revenues required to
each class.
(Prior Code, § 9-32) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)
§ 52.038 RECORDS.
   (A)   The town shall keep proper books and records relative to the revenues
and expenses of the sewage works and shall maintain in its files all reports
relative to strength and character of usage. All such records shall be made
available for inspection by representatives of the Environmental Protection
Agency at all reasonable times.
   (B)   The town shall report monthly to the Environmental Protection Agency
such information as requested by the Agency in the form the Agency shall
prescribe.
(Prior Code, § 9-33) (Ord. 1984-4, passed 12-27-1984)

(Prior Code, § 9-45) (Ord. 1975-11, passed 8-16-1975)
§ 52.056 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY FACTORS.
   Industrial cost recovery shall be based on the following factors.
   (A)   Each year during the industrial cost recovery period, each industrial
user of the treatment works shall pay its share of the total grant amount
divided by the recovery period.
   (B)   The industrial cost recovery period shall be 30 years.
   (C)   Payments shall be made by industrial users no less often than
annually. The first payment by an industrial user shall be made not later than
one year after such user begins use of the treatment works.
   (D)   An industrial user’s share shall be based on all factors which
significantly influence the cost of the treatment works. Factors such as
strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered
and included to ensure a proportional distribution of the grant amount
allocable to industrial use to all industrial users of the treatment works. As
a minimum, an industry’s share shall be based on its flow versus treatment
works capacity except in unusual cases.
   (E)   If there is a substantial change in the strength, volume, or delivery
flow rate characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an industrial
user, such user’s share shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (F)   If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works, each
existing industrial user’s share shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (G)   An industrial user’s share shall not include any portion of the grant
amount allocable to unused or unreserved capacity.
   (H)   An industrial user’s share shall include any firm commitment to the
town of increased use by such user.
   (I)   An industrial user’s share shall not include an interest component.
   (J)   (1)   The town shall retain 50% of the amounts recovered from
industrial users. The remainder, together with any interest earned thereon,
shall be returned to the U.S. Treasury on an annual basis.
      (2)   (a)   A minimum of 80% of the retained amounts, together with
interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for the eligible costs of the
expansion of reconstruction of treatment works associated with the project and
necessary to meet the requirement of the Environmental Protection Agency.
         (b)   The town shall obtain the written approval of the Regional
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency prior to commitment of the
retained amounts for any expansion and reconstruction.
         (c)   The remainder of the retained amounts may be used as the town
sees fit.
      (3)   Pending use, the town shall invest the retained amounts for
reconstruction and expansion in:
         (a)   Obligations of the U.S. Government;
         (b)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government or any agency thereof; or
         (c)   Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof.

§ 52.057 INDUSTRIAL CLASS USERS; FORMULAS.
   The amounts to be recovered annually from each industrial class user shall
be determined in accordance with the three formulas set out below.
   (A)   (1)   For flow related recovery, the formula for each industrial class
user shall be:
 
RF = FC x (User Flow-Annually/Design Flow-Annually) x (1/30 years)
 
      (2)   Definition of terms is:
         (a)   RF: industrial cost recovery based on flow; and
         (b)   FC: capital costs which are flow related.
   (B)   (1)   For BOD related recovery, the formula for each industrial class
user shall be:
 
RB = BC x (User Loading - Pounds (Based on 200 mg/l as minimum)/Design Capacity
- Pounds) x (1/30 years)
 
      (2)   Definition of terms is:
         (a)   RB: industrial cost recovery based on BOD loading; and
         (b)   BC: capital costs which are strength related.
   (C)   (1)   For suspended solids related recovery, the formula for each
industrial class user shall be:
 
RS = SC x (User Loading - Pounds (based on 250 mg/l as minimum)/Design Capacity
- Pounds) x (1/30 years)
 
      (2)   Definition of terms is:
         (a)   RS: industrial cost recovery based on suspended solids loading;
and
         (b)   SC: capital costs which are strength related.
   (D)   Until such time as a unit process cost study is developed, the amounts
of capital costs used in the formulas in divisions (A) through (C) above shall
be 40% of total capital costs for flow, and 30% each for BOD and suspended
solids.

businesses, and similar businesses.
(Prior Code, § 4-51) (Ord. 1997-7, passed 8-7-1997)
§ 112.02 INTENT.
   In the development and adoption of this chapter, it is recognized that there
are some businesses, by their very nature and their operational
characteristics, that cause concern for the public safety of the residents of
the town when such businesses are located in close proximity to residential
neighborhoods, schools, and churches. These businesses have caused a public
safety concern and a concern for potential deleterious impact upon property
values and the quality of life in such surrounding areas. Special regulations
are deemed necessary to control the effects arising from these enterprises as
set forth below. The primary purpose of these controls and regulations is to
protect the public safety in general as well as the integrity, value, and
character of residential neighborhoods, and to protect minors from the
objectionable operational characteristics of these adult uses by restricting
their close proximity to churches, parks, schools, day care centers, other
businesses of similar nature, and residential areas as well as hours of
operations.
(Prior Code, § 4-52) (Ord. 1997-7, passed 8-7-1997)

to the sale or display of such material.
   ADULT BUSINESS. Any commercial activity whether conducted intermittently or
free time, which primarily involves the sale, display, exhibition, or viewing

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-9-2016)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-9-2016)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-9-2016)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-9-2016)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
Additionally, unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR, and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below
ground-level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any

of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;

velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground-level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOF- ING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six- month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars; and
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of floodwaters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures; and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.

flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929 is a

the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD or 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that
has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone
that begins with the letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See
REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood, or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is: built on a single chassis; 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for
recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.

where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the State Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The REGULATORY FLOOD elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. The section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAS of the town are
generally identified as such on the county and incorporated areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated June 5, 2012 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-
A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally aboveground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any recon- struction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X.
      (1)   Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal
hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
      (2)   However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe,
concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood
insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by
regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of
Zones B and C.)

   (B)   The best available regulatory flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of the county and
incorporated areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated June 5,
2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an A Zone
on the county and incorporated areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated June 5,
2012, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the State Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that
meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be
submitted to the State Department of Natural Resources for review and
subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the State
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing,
paving, and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non- substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non- boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the State Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   (1)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
State Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the
floodway.
      (2)   Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the State Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State Department of
Natural Resources.
      (4)   However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.

§ 151.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 8-9-2016) Penalty, see §

§ 151.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the State Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local

for the denial, within a period of eight working days following application.
   (F)   Expiration.
      (1)   The work or use authorized by an improvement location permit must
be commenced within six months of the issuance of the permit. After such time,
if the work or use has not begun, said permit shall lapse and become null and
void.
      (2)   With the exception of temporary uses, if work or the use authorized
by the permit has begun within six months of the issuance of the permit, the
improvement location permit shall remain in full force and effect for two years
from the date of issuance.
   (G)   Appeals. A decision of the Administrator may be appealed to the Board

certificate of occupancy shall be kept by the Administrator and shall become
part of the public record.
   (I)   Special cases.
      (1)   Industrial uses: certificate of compliance.
         (a)   If an application for an improvement location permit relates to

to §
156.069.
         (b)   In the event that a single-family home has been destroyed by
fire, explosion, act of God, or public enemy and an improvement location permit
has been issued for its replacement or reconstruction, the property owner may
make application for an improvement location permit for a mobile home to be
placed on the same property for a period not to exceed one year. No extensions
of time shall be permitted by the Administrator.

constructed or reconstructed single-family home. Said cash bond may be drawn on
by the Town Council, at its discretion, upon the advice of the Administrator
that the property owner has failed to remove the mobile home either at the end
of one year or within two weeks of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for the constructed or reconstructed single-family home, whichever comes first.
Said cash bond may be used to defray expenses incurred by the town for the
removal of the mobile home and/or legal costs and attorney fees directly
associated with the enforcement of this division (I)(2).

§ 156.029 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   It is unlawful to occupy or permit the occupancy of any structure hereafter
created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged,
except for structures other than residences incidental to agricultural
operations, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Building
Inspector. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period not
to exceed six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a structure
pending its completion, provided, that such temporary certificate of occupancy
includes such conditions and safeguards as will protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the occupants and the public. When a certificate of occupancy is
requested and all landscaping screens or buffers as required by §§
156.210 through
156.217 have not and cannot be installed due to weather or other conditions,
the staff may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy, provided that the
party requesting such occupancy shall first submit a detailed landscaping plan.
Such landscaping plan shall contain a schedule for the installation of all
materials, and the applicant shall certify in writing that such schedule will
be followed unless an extension is granted by the staff.

NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 156.040 INTERPRETATION AND INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this chapter or by amendments that may
later be adopted, there may exist certain structures or uses of land that were
lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which are prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or may be by future
amendments hereto. Such legal nonconforming uses and structures may include:
nonconforming lots; nonconforming structures; nonconforming uses of land; and
nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination. It is the intent of
this chapter to permit these nonconforming lots, structures, and uses of land
to continue under the provisions of this section until they are removed but not
to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
legal nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor
be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses which are prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. 2014-26, passed 9- -2014) Penalty, see §

§ 156.043 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or
development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently. Where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially completed preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that the work shall be carried on diligently. ACTUAL
CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined as work done which is beyond the preparation
stage and into that stage where the changes or additions are made permanent.

§ 156.044 ORDINARY REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any legal nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the current replacement
cost of the nonconforming structure and market value of real estate, or
nonconforming portion of the structure, whichever the case may be, provided
that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be
increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official. If a legal nonconforming structure or portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful by reason
of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or
rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it
is located.

§ 156.046 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling may be constructed on a single lot that was legally established
and recorded, even if this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, establishes a
minimum lot width or area requirement for the district that exceeds the width
or area of this lot. All other requirements of this chapter and its subsequent
amendments must be met for the use of this lot.

§ 156.047 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter, lawful uses of land exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, the
uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions.
   (A)   Enlargement of use. No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or
increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.

any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (C)   Termination by discontinuance or abandonment. If any nonconforming
uses of land are discontinued for a continuous period in excess of six months
(except where government action impedes access to the premises), such period of
discontinuance of use shall constitute an abandonment of the use, and any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
chapter for the district in which such land is located.
   (D)   New construction. No additional structure or accessory structure not
conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection
with a nonconforming use of land.

§ 156.048 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not now be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   Structural alteration or enlargement. No nonconforming structure may
be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (B)   Damage or destruction. Should any nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of
more than 50% of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the
damage, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (C)   Moving. Should any nonconforming structure be moved for any reason or
for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for
the district in which it is located after it is moved.

§ 156.049 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Structural alteration or enlargement. No existing structure devoted to
a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located
shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the
district in which it is located.
   (B)   Extension of use. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no nonconforming use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (C)   Change in use. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in
or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (D)   Termination by discontinuance or abandonment. If any nonconforming use
of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued for a
continuous period in excess of six months (except where government action
impedes access to the premises), such period of discontinuance of use shall
constitute an abandonment of the use of the structure, or structure and land in
combination, and the structure or structure and land in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   (E)   Removal of structure. Where nonconforming use status applies to a
structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. However, any future use
of the land must be in conformity with the regulations of the district in which
it is located.

§ 156.066 PRINCIPAL USES.
   (A)   A principal use may be authorized as either a permitted use or a
special exception. Permitted uses are those uses which are allowed without
special permission of the Board of Zoning Appeals, given that they follow the

because some principal uses may contain special provisions in some districts,
§§
156.120 through
156.126,
156.140 through
156.144, and
156.155 through

industrial operations, may be permissible on a single lot under the terms of
this chapter.
   (D)   Any preexisting legal use that continues in a district where it is not
currently authorized is subject to all of the zoning ordinance provisions for
that use in the areas where that use is authorized.

         (a)   The operator of every home occupation shall reside in the
dwelling unit in which the home occupation operates.
         (b)   The home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the
principal residential structure and shall be incidental and subordinate to the
principal residential use of the structure. No work shall be conducted within
any attached or detached garage. Limited storage may be allowed in any attached

         (c)   The home occupation shall not interfere with the delivery of
utilities or other services to the neighborhood in which the principal
residential structure is located.
         (d)   No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater
volume than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and the
need for off-street parking shall be accommodated on site.
         (e)   The activity shall not generate any noise, vibrations, smoke,
dust, odors, heat, glare, or interfere with radio or television reception in
the area that would exceed that normally produced by a dwelling unit used
solely for residential purposes.
         (f)   No toxic, explosive, flammable, radioactive, or other hazardous
materials shall be used, sold, or stored on the site. However, materials common
to ordinary household use are permitted, provided the quantity of such

residential structure designed to promote or draw attention to the home
occupation shall not be permitted. Furthermore, no displays or other
indications of a home occupation in the yard, on the exterior of the dwelling
unit, or visible from anywhere outside of the dwelling unit shall be permitted,
except for one non-animated, non-illuminated, non-flashing announcement plate,

individual dwelling unit, provided all other standards and criteria applicable
to home occupations are complied with. Such criteria shall be applied
cumulatively to both uses as opposed to singularly to each use.
      (2)   Certain uses by their very nature of investment or operation have a
pronounced tendency, once commenced, to expand beyond the scope of activity
permitted for home occupations, and thereby impair the integrity of the
residential district in which they are located. For this reason, the following
uses, regardless of their possible compliance with the standards set for
accessory use or home occupations are strictly prohibited:

clearly subordinate to the primary residential use in both size and location on
the lot. Special exceptions for accessory apartments shall be obtained from the
Board of Zoning Appeals as per §§
156.085 through
156.093 and must be renewed every five years.

156.176 shall be met.
      (4)   Guestrooms shall not be used for cooking or eating, however, meals
may be provided. Dining and other facilities shall not be open to the public
but shall be exclusively for the use of the residents and registered bed and
breakfast guests, unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that opening the
facilities to the public will not have a negative impact on the surrounding
area. The Board may set any additional regulations necessary to ensure that
public use of such facilities will be in harmony with the surrounding area.
      (5)   There shall be no more than the equivalent of one nonresident full-
time employee hired solely for the purpose of working for the bed and breakfast
use.
   (G)   Public utility installations for local service shall be permitted.

lot and shall abide by all setback regulations; and
      (3)   Hobby farming does not include the raising or presence of any
livestock generally associated with a farm except as otherwise allowed
specifically in this chapter.
   (I)   These regulations shall apply to satellite dish antenna and other
satellite reception devices greater than two feet in diameter.
      (1)   General purposes.
         (a)   These regulations contained herein are designed to promote the
public health and safety by providing criteria for the placement of these
antennas that ensures that all such installations are performed in a manner
that limits endangerment of life and property on the site and on surrounding
properties due to collapse or destruction.
         (b)   These regulations are also designed to decrease the potential
for urban blight in residential neighborhoods generated by guy-wires, poles,
cables, and other appurtenances.
         (c)   These regulations are, however, intended to allow satellite dish
antennas and other satellite reception devices to be located in a manner that:
does not unreasonably delay or prevent the installation, maintenance, or use of
the antenna; does not unreasonably increase the cost of installation,
maintenance or use of the antenna; or preclude reception of an acceptable
quality signal.
      (2)   General requirements.
         (a)   No person shall install a satellite dish antenna greater than
two feet in diameter without first obtaining an improvement location permit.
         (b)   Satellite dish antenna may be erected in all residential zoning

   (N)   (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of wireless communication service
facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
public while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development
of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace within the corporate
limits of the town.
      (2)   District requirements.
         (a)   Wireless communication service facilities may be allowed in the
following districts. (Subject to the limitations set forth herein, wireless
communication service facilities shall be exempt from the maximum height
limitations established in each zoning district.)
         (b)   Wireless communication service facilities requiring a special
exception shall be subject to §§
156.085 through
156.093. Wireless communication service facilities permitted as of right shall
be subject to the requirements of §§
156.028 and
156.072. A wireless communications facility may be located on a lot occupied by
another principal structure.
      (3)   Districts use status height limitations.
         (a)   Table of height limitations:
Type Height Limitation
Type                  Height Limitation
C-1 special exception Not to exceed 150 feet
C-2 permitted         Not to exceed 150 feet
C-2 special exception Not to exceed 250 feet
I-1 permitted         Not to exceed 200 feet
I-1 special exception Not to exceed 250 feet
I-2 permitted         Not to exceed 200 feet
Special exception     Not to exceed 250 feet
 
         (b)   For the purpose of determining compliance with the requirements
of this section, measurement of a facility’s height shall include the structure
itself (for roof or building mounted facilities), the base pad, and any other
equipment attached thereto that extends more than 20 feet over the top of the
structure itself. The structure height shall be measured from grade.
         (c)   Notwithstanding the forgoing height requirements, building or
roof-mounted wireless communication service facilities shall not exceed a
height in excess of 100% of the host building.
         (d)   The town encourages the collocation of commercial wireless tele-
communications service facility antennas on existing or planned commercial
wireless telecommunications service facilities in order to minimize the
proliferation of antenna support structures and to achieve the most efficient
use of land within the community. Therefore, the collocation of subsequent
commercial wireless telecommunications service facility antennas on existing
facilities, whether such facilities were originally permitted as of right or
through the special exception process, will only require obtaining an
improvement location permit (§
156.028).
      (4)   Applications. In addition to requirements of §§
156.085 through
156.093, §
156.028, or any other requirement prescribed by this chapter as the case may
be, applications for the establishment of a commercial wireless
telecommunications service facility shall include at least the following
information:
         (a)   The name, address, and telephone number of the owner and lessee
of the parcel of land upon which the commercial wireless telecommunications
service facility is to be situated. If the applicant is not the owner of the
property, documentation must be provided that shows that the owner of the
property has granted, by agreement, use of the property for the proposed
facility;
         (b)   The name, address, and telephone number of all owners of other
wireless communication service facilities within the service area of the
proposed facility, including municipally owned property;
         (c)   Documentation, signed by an engineer licensed in the state, that
the facility is designed in accordance with the town’s Building Code and with
national standards for steel towers, in addition to all other state and federal
laws and regulations applicable thereto; and
         (d)   An affidavit attesting to the fact that the applicant made
diligent, but unsuccessful, efforts to receive permission to install or
collocate the applicant’s facility on another service provider’s facility
within the service area desired by the applicant and that the proposed site is,
therefore, of practical necessity for the applicant. This requirement for
seeking an alternative existing site expressly includes the need to consider
every available site outside of municipal boundaries of the town as well as
inside the municipal boundaries. A diligent effort shall require that all
owners of potentially suitable structures within a one-quarter mile radius of
the proposed wireless communications tower site be contacted and that one or
more of the following reasons for not selecting such structure apply.
            1.   The proposed antennas and related equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing structure and its reinforcement could not
be accomplished at a reasonable cost.
            2.   The proposed antennas and related equipment would cause radio
frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing
structure and the interference could not be prevented at a reasonable cost.
            3.   Such existing structures do not have adequate location, space,
access, or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
            4.   Addition of the proposed antennas and related equipment would
result in electromagnetic radiation from such structure exceeding applicable
standards established by the Federal Communications Commission governing human
exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
            5.   A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with
the owners of such structures.
      (5)   General requirements. In addition to any other requirement
prescribed by this chapter, a wireless communication service facility shall be

wireless telecommunications service facility, and shall not be located within
the required yard areas (setbacks) dictated by the zoning district in which it
is located.
         (e)   Free standing or guy-wire anchored wireless communication
service facilities and their related accessory structures when located on a
site as an accessory use shall be located behind the rear building line of the
structure housing the principal use. Vehicle access to the tower and related
accessory structure shall not interfere with the parking or vehicular
circulation provided for the principal use.
         (f)   Wireless communication service facilities shall be designed to
be compatible with neighboring buildings and uses. Efforts shall be taken when

or natural environment and shall not exceed a height of 15 feet, nor exceed a
size of 450 square feet.
         (m)   No signals or lights or other illumination shall be permitted on
the wireless communication service facilities unless required by the Federal
Communication Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, or by the town.
         (n)   Every wireless communication service facility shall be separated
from all other wireless communication service facilities a minimum of 1,500
feet.
         (o)   No wireless communication service facility may be established as
an accessory use on a property prior to the establishment of a principal use.
         (p)   Where a wireless communication service facility becomes
abandoned, obsolescent, or ceases to be used, except in relation to acts of
God, it shall be taken down and removed from the premises by the owner of the
facility, or its agents, or the person having control of the premises on which
the facility is located within six months of a finding by the Zoning
Administrator of its abandonment, obsolescence, or cessation of use.
         (q)   Wireless communication facilities shall be accessible from a

§ 156.173 PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES TO REDUCE PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following programs and incentives are provided to permit reduced parking
requirements in the locations and situations outlined herein where the basic
parking requirements of this code would be excessive or detrimental to goals
and policies of the town relating to traffic congestion and environmental
protection.
   (A)   Parking reductions in the CB Districts. There are no off-street
parking requirements in the HCB District. However, for each building erected
and for certain other uses of land in the HMU District, parking spaces for
motor vehicles and loading and unloading berths as specified for the use to
which such building or land is to be devoted shall be provided, except that the
Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a special exception that waives the parking
spaces required when the use is located within 300 feet of a public parking
lot, and where a use fronts a street with parallel parking, credit toward off-
street parking shall be granted at the rate of one off-street space per every
25 feet of frontage.
   (B)   Credit for off-street parking or public parking in non-CB Districts.
Wherever on-street parking or other public parking is provided in the
improvement of a street, credit toward off-street parking requirements shall be
granted at the rate of one off-street space for every marked on-street or
public space.
   (C)   Mixed-use shared parking programs.
      (1)   Purpose. The town recognizes that strict application of the
required parking regulations may result in the provision of excessive numbers
of parking spaces, and therefore, excessive pavement and impermeable surfaces.
A mixed-use shared parking program provides an option to reduce the total
required parking in large mixed-use facilities in which uses operate at
different times from one another throughout the day.
      (2)   Applicability. The mixed use shared parking program may be applied
where mixed uses are proposed.
      (3)   Procedure.
         (a)   The Administrator may authorize a reduction in the total number
of required parking spaces for two or more uses jointly providing on-site
parking, if the respective hours of operation of the uses do not overlap.
         (b)   The total number of parking spaces shall not be reduced by more
than 20%.
(Ord. 2014-26, passed 9- -2014) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.174 LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING.
   (A)   General requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
off-street parking shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the use it is
intended to serve.
   (B)   Off-site parking facilities. Required parking for a nonresidential
development may be located off-site under certain circumstances. Requests for
variances allowing the substitution of off-site for on-site parking must meet
the following requirements, in addition to the standard variance criteria.
      (1)   The off-site parking shall be located so that it will adequately
serve the use for which it is intended. In making this determination the
following factors, among other things, shall be considered:
         (a)   Proximity of the off-site parking facilities, generally within
300 feet of the use they are intended to serve;
         (b)   Ease of pedestrian access to the off-site parking facilities;
and
         (c)   The type of use the off-site parking facilities are intended to
serve. For example, off-street parking may not be appropriate for high turnover
uses such as retail.
      (2)   A written commitment shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the Town
Attorney and executed by all parties concerned; assuring the continued
availability of off-site parking facilities for the use they are intended to
serve.
   (C)   Front yard parking requirements. Parking spaces may not be located in
the required front yard except in business and industrial districts. However,
no parking area shall be permitted within five feet of the front property line
in any district.
(Ord. 2014-26, passed 9- -2014) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.175 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
   Each parking area shall comply with the standards as hereinafter set forth.
   (A)   Design.
      (1)   Parking spaces and maneuvering aisles shall have the minimum

       (3)   (a)   Driveways shall be arranged for the free flow of vehicles at
all times, and all maneuvering spaces and aisles shall be so designed that all
vehicles may exit from and enter into a public street by being driven in a
forward direction, except that residents and employees may be permitted to back
in from alleys. (See diagram above.)
         (b)   Each required off-street parking space shall be designed so that
any motor vehicle may proceed to and from said space without requiring the
moving of any other or by passing over any other parking space, except where
the parking area is limited to employees.
      (4)   On any parking area in any district, all paved portions of all
parking spaces and maneuvering aisles shall be set back a minimum of five feet
from any wall of a building, and a minimum of five feet from any private or
public way, or any lot line of any land in residential districts or used for a
residential purpose.
      (5)   All parking areas shall provide means of pedestrian circulation to
the use and between the use and the street.
   (B)   Construction.
      (1)   All required parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, and driveways,
except in the Flood Plain District, shall have a durable, dustless, all-weather
surface, such as bituminous concrete or cement concrete, and shall provide for
a satisfactory disposal of surface water by grading and drainage in such a
manner that no surface water shall drain onto any lot in other ownership. Such
surfaces shall be well maintained.
      (2)   Parking areas in all districts shall be provided with curbing,
wheel stops, or other devices to prevent motor vehicles from being parked or
driven within required setback areas or into required landscaped open space.
      (3)   In any parking area the surface shall be painted, marked, or
otherwise delineated so that each parking space is apparent.
   (C)   Landscaping and screening. All parking lots designed for 15 or more
parking spaces shall provide landscaping and screening in accordance with the
provisions of §§
156.212 and
156.213. Smaller parking lots shall provide landscaping as deemed appropriate
by the Administrator.
   (D)   Lighting.
      (1)   All parking lots shall be illuminated.
      (2)   All artificial lighting used to illuminate a parking area,
maneuvering space, or driveway shall be arranged and shielded so as to prevent
direct glare from the light sources into any public street or private way or
onto adjacent property. Illumination shall measure no more than five foot-
candles on adjacent public or private streets and no more than one foot-candle
on adjacent residential properties.

the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by trucks or similar
vehicles.
   (A)   Location.
      (1)   All required off-street loading berths shall be located on the same
lot as the use to be served, and no portion of the vehicle shall project into a

25 feet of the nearest point of intersection of any two streets, nor shall it
be located in a required front yard, or side yard adjoining a street.
      (2)   No loading berth for vehicles over a two-ton capacity shall be

§ 156.190 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide a legal framework for the
comprehensive regulation of signs in the town. It recognizes the need for
adequate identification, advertising, and communication within the community
that is structurally sound, well maintained, and attractive in appearance.
   (B)   To achieve this purpose, the subchapter is intended to control the
height, area, location, and other similar aspects of signs and sign structures
while also:
      (1)   Preserving the noncommercial character of residential
neighborhoods;
      (2)   Providing reasonable yet appropriate conditions for identifying
businesses and services rendered in commercial, institutional, and industrial
areas;
      (3)   Reducing traffic hazards by restricting signs and lights which
exceed a viewer’s capacity to receive information or which increases the
potential for accidents created by signage which distracts or obstructs a
viewer’s vision; and
      (4)   Protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents
of the town.

      (1)   All signs requiring a permit shall be located on the premises they

streets in such a manner as to obstruct the free and clear vision of a driver
of a vehicle or a pedestrian.
      (3)   No sign shall be erected or maintained so as to prevent the free
ingress or egress from any door, window, or fire escape, and no signs shall be
attached to a standpipe or fire escape.
      (4)   No sign shall have more than two sign faces.
      (5)   No persons shall permit, maintain, or display any sign painted
directly on an exterior wall, fascia, or parapet of a building, fence, or
chimney, except however, existing signs advertising a business operating on the
same premises may be retained, provided the sign receives regular maintenance.
In the HCB District wall signs may be permitted as a special exception provided
that they are in character with the historic nature of the district and similar
to the painted type of sign found on center town buildings a century ago.
      (6)   No sign shall be allowed or maintained if the sign shall, in any
way, violate existing state or federal regulations governing such signs. Signs
controlled by these provisions shall be in compliance therewith and no such
sign shall exceed a height of 35 feet above ground-level.
      (7)   No person shall place, paste, print, or affix, in any manner, a
handbill, sign, poster, advertisement, or notice of any kind in any public
right-of-way on any trees, light standards, telephone poles, or other
supporting structure.
      (8)   Except as otherwise permitted in this section, no sign shall be
located so as to project above the top edge of the roof or the top of the
parapet, whichever forms the top line of the building silhouette and in no case
exceed a height of 20 feet, whichever is lower.
      (9)   Signs shall be permitted on awnings, canopies, and marquees.
However, such signs shall not exceed a height of 20 feet above the average
surrounding grade. The area of such signs shall be counted against the maximum
sign surface area permitted by this section.
   (B)   Specific limitations on sign location.
      (1)   Residential districts. In the residential districts, permitted
signs may be located anywhere on the property, provided they are no closer than
ten feet to any lot line and are not located in the public right-of-way.
      (2)   Commercial districts.
         (a)   No sign shall be placed or project into the public right-of-way,
nor shall a sign attached to a building extend more than 24 inches from the
face of the building or be less than eight feet above grade.
         (b)   Except as otherwise noted in this section, no building-mounted
sign shall extend above the top line of the face of the building or exceed a
height of 20 feet, whichever is lower.
         (c)   Pole or monument signs, as permitted herein, shall be set back
from every lot line one foot for each foot in height above average surrounding
grade.
      (3)   Office and industrial districts.
         (a)   No sign shall be placed or project into the public right-of-way
nor shall a sign attached to a building extend more than 12 inches from the
face of the building.
         (b)   Except as otherwise permitted by this section, no building-

         (c)   Freestanding or ground signs, as permitted herein, shall be set
back from every lot line one-half foot for each foot in height above average
surrounding grade.
   (C)   Illumination.
      (1)   Location and design of light source. Whenever an external
artificial light source is used to illuminate a sign, such source shall be
located, shielded, and directed so as to not be visible from any public street
or private residence. No receptacle or device housing a permitted light source
which is attached to the sign itself shall protrude more than 12 inches from
the face of the sign or building to which it is attached. If ground lighting is
used to illuminate a sign, the receptacle or device should not protrude more
than 12 inches and must be fully screened from view by landscaping.
      (2)   Level of illumination. In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source exceed
100 footlamberts at the sign face. All artificial illumination shall be so
designed, located, shielded, and directed as to prevent the casting of direct
light upon adjacent property or streets. No exposed reflective type bulb or
incandescent lamp, which exceeds 15 watts, shall be used on the exterior
surface of any sign so as to expose the face of the bulb, light, or lamp to any
public street or adjacent property. All sources of light, whether by direct
exposure, surface reflection, or transmission, having an intrinsic brightness
greater than two foot-candles shall be shielded so that the source of light
cannot be seen at any point within a residential district.
      (3)   Signs adjacent to residential areas. Signs located on a lot
abutting a residential district or a sign within 100 feet of any residentially
zoned area shall be so designed, located, shielded, and directed so as to
prevent the casting of direct light upon adjacent properties or streets.
   (D)   Sign area computation. The following principals shall control the
computation of sign area.
      (1)   Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the background or the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing unless such
framework or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign.
      (2)   Computation of area of multiple-faced signs. The sign area for a
sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of
all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are
placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the
same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are
not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the faces.
   (E)   Construction and design standards. All signs shall meet the
construction and design standards set forth for signs in
Chapter 155 of this code of ordinances.
   (F)   Litter control. All signs and the premises surrounding the sign shall
be maintained in a clean, sanitary, and inoffensive condition, and free and
clear of all obnoxious substances, rubbish, and weeds.
   (G)   Maintenance. Every sign established in the town shall, at all times,
be maintained in good structural condition, and be painted at least once every
two years, including all metal parts and supports thereof that are not
galvanized or of rust resistant metals. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to inspect any sign pursuant to §
156.198, and order any remedial action authorized thereunder.
   (H)   Landscaping requirements. Every permit application for a monument sign
shall be accompanied by a landscape plan meeting the standards hereinafter
specified.
      (1)   For every square foot of sign surface area, there shall be provided
one and one-half square feet of landscape area.
      (2)   Any monument sign constructed or erected to a height in excess of
eight feet above the average surrounding grade shall be required to be improved
with an additional one and one-half square feet of landscaped area for each
foot of height or portion thereof that said sign is constructed or erected
above said eight feet in height.
      (3)   Sod or seeded areas shall not qualify as a landscaped area.
      (4)   The required landscaped areas shall be improved with such plantings
as hedges, conifers, flowering plants, evergreens, and the like, of a size and
in quantity proportionate to the size and height of the sign as judged by the
Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   In addition to the plantings herein described, the landscaped areas
shall also include ground protection such as, but not limited to, ground cover
plants, landscaping bark, decorative stone, or landscape timbers.
      (6)   It shall be the duty of each party owning any lot or parcel
improved with the landscaping required herein to maintain said landscaping
including, but not by way of limitation, the replacement of any dead or
diseased vegetation, the trimming of any overgrown vegetation, and the
maintenance of any groundcover or protection provided in accordance with the
terms hereof.
   (I)   Wind pressure and dead load requirements. All signs and sign
structures shall be designed and constructed to withstand wind pressures and
dead loads as required by
Chapter 155 of this code of ordinances.
   (J)   Identification and marking. Each sign hereafter erected or remodeled
shall bear in a prominent position thereon a clearly legible identification
plate, stating the name of the person responsible for its construction and
erection. Electrical signs shall be marked with input amperes at full load
input.

to enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Inspection. The Zoning Administrator may inspect, at such times as
deemed necessary, each sign or sign structure regulated by this section for the
purpose of ascertaining whether the sign is in compliance with this section or
any other relevant town code, law, or ordinance.
   (C)   Unsafe and unlawful signs.
      (1)   Duty to remove or repair.
         (a)   Should the Zoning Administrator find any sign regulated by this
section to be unsafe, unlawful, or a menace to the public, or constructed,
erected, or maintained in violation of the provisions of this section, he or
she shall cause notice to be given to the holder of the permit.
         (b)   If the holder of the permit should fail to remove the sign or
bring the sign or other advertising structure in compliance, the Zoning
Administrator may cause, at the holder’s or property owner’s expense, the sign
or other advertising structure to be removed or brought into compliance.
         (c)   If the holder or owner fails to pay the costs and expenses of
such repair or removal within 30 days of the notice, then such costs and
expenses shall become a lien against the property. In addition, the Zoning
Administrator shall refuse to issue a sign permit to any holder or owner who
refuses to pay the costs and expenses assessed under this provision.
      (2)   Unlawful signs. Unlawful signs, regardless of type, shall be
removed within 24 hours of the time when notice was perfected.

person having the control of the premises upon which the sign is located.
      (2)   Notice. The Zoning Administrator shall give notice to the owner or
to any person occupying the property that the sign on the premises is in
violation.
      (3)   Failure to comply. Failure to comply with the notice within the

premises upon which such sign is located.
      (4)   Lien. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the owner or occupant
of the premises of the total costs incurred for such repair or removal of the

repair or removal within 30 days of the notice, then such costs and expenses
shall become a lien against the property.

      (1)   Authority to continue. Any lawful sign located within the town at

conform to the provisions of this section, may continue, provided the sign
remains in conformance with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Conditions of lawful status. For the purposes of this section,
legal, nonconforming status shall be conferred only on signs authorized by a
sign permit or variance of a preceding ordinance, title, code, or law, or if no
sign permit was required under the applicable preceding ordinance, code, or
law.

relieve the owner or beneficial user of a legal nonconforming sign, or the
owner of the property on which the legal nonconforming sign is located from the
provisions of this section regarding safety, maintenance, and repair. Normal
maintenance, including repainting, cleaning, or routine repair of a legal
nonconforming sign shall not be deemed to be a condition which triggers a loss
of lawful status described below, unless such maintenance increases, in fact,
the nonconforming aspects of the sign.
      (4)   Repairs pursuant to public order. Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a
legal nonconforming sign in accordance with a reasonable order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such
a sign to be unsafe and order its restoration to a safe condition, provided
such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of
this section prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or
destroyed signs.
      (5)   Loss of lawful status.
         (a)   Legal nonconforming status shall terminate under the following
conditions: if the use of a sign is discontinued for a period of 60 days it
shall be deemed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished; if a sign
is structurally altered such that its nonconforming aspects increase; or if a
sign is relocated, replaced, or moved in any way, or the sign is damaged and
the cost of repair is 50% of its replacement value.
         (b)   Upon the happening of any of the aforementioned events, the sign
shall be immediately brought into compliance with this section in conjunction
with a new sign permit or the sign shall be removed. For the purposes of this
section, the changing of copy shall not be considered the replacement of an
existing legal nonconforming sign.

      (1)   PERMANENT OPEN SPACE shall be defined as parks, playgrounds,
landscaped green space, and natural areas, not including schools, community
centers, or other similar areas in public ownership;
      (2)   No plan for a planned unit development shall be approved, unless
such plan provides for permanent landscaped or natural open space. A minimum of
25% of the proposed planned unit development area shall be designated as
permanent open space;
      (3)   In the case of mixed uses, permanent open space shall be allocated
to the property in proportion to the uses assigned to the planned unit
development and shall be located in reasonable proximity to those uses.
Provided, however, the permanent open space need not be located in proximity to
the use in the case of preservation of existing features;
      (4)   If the concept plan provides for the planned unit development to be
constructed in stages, open space must be provided for each stage of the

      (5)   Permanent open space shall be conveyed in one of the following
forms:
         (a)   To a municipal or public corporation;
         (b)   To a not-for-profit corporation or entity established for the
purpose of benefitting the owners and tenants of the planned unit development
or, where appropriate and where approved by the Plan Commission and the Town
Council, adjoining property owners, or both. All conveyances hereunder shall be
structured to ensure that the grantee has the obligation and the right to
effect maintenance and improvement of the common open space, and that such duty
of maintenance and improvement is enforced by the owners and tenants of the
planned unit development and, where applicable, by adjoining property owners
and/or the town;
         (c)   To owners other than those specified in divisions (E)(5)(a) and

§ 156.253 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Introduction. Application shall be accompanied by all plans and
documents required by §
156.254. A three-step application process shall be used. The steps in the
process are:
      (1)   Predesign conference;
      (2)   Concept plan approval; and
      (3)   Site plan approval.
   (B)   Predesign conference. Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a planned unit development, the applicant shall schedule a
predesign conference with the Zoning Administrator. The purpose of the
predesign conference shall be to:
      (1)   Allow the applicant to present a general concept and to discuss
characteristics of the development concept in relation to adopted town
policies;
      (2)   Allow the Zoning Administrator to inform the applicant of
applicable policies, standards, and procedures for the planned unit
development; and
      (3)   The predesign conference is intended only for the above purposes,
neither the developer nor the jurisdiction is bound by any decision made during
a pre-application conference.
   (C)   Procedure for concept plan approval.
      (1)   The concept plan and application for the planned unit development
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator who, after making an initial
determination that the application is not lacking in any substantive manner,
shall initiate a review by the Zoning Administrator and town’s designated
engineer.
      (2)   The application and the results of the review shall then be
forwarded to the Plan Commission for its consideration, public hearing, and
recommendations together with the Zoning Administrator’s report and such other
documents as may be pertinent to the planned unit development.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with
its rules of procedure.
      (4)   Where there are environmentally sensitive features on the site or
the site plan is expected to be complex, or there are other important planning
implications involved, the Plan Commission may reserve the right to review the
site plan. And, where the Plan Commission recommends denial of a concept plan
and the Town Council approves the plan, the Plan Commission shall review the
site plan.
      (5)   Upon completion of its review, the Plan Commission shall certify
the application to the Town Council with a favorable recommendation, an
unfavorable recommendation, or no recommendation.
      (6)   The Town Council shall vote on the proposal within 90 days after
the Plan Commission certifies the proposal. The Council may adopt or reject the
proposal. If the Plan Commission has given the proposal a favorable
recommendation and the Council fails to act on the proposal within 90 days, the
ordinance takes effect as if it had been adopted as certified 90 days after
certification. If the Plan Commission has failed to make a recommendation or
has given the proposal an unfavorable recom- mendation and the Council fails to
act on the proposal within 90 days, the proposal is defeated.
   (D)   Effect of approval of concept plan.
      (1)   When a concept plan for a planned unit development has been
approved by the Council, the plan shall become effective and its location shall
be shown on the Zoning Map. The Zoning Map shall be amended to designate the
site as a planned unit development.
      (2)   Upon such amendment of the Zoning Map, the use and development of
the site shall be governed by the planned unit development concept plan,
subject to approval of a site plan.
      (3)   No permit of any kind shall be issued until the site plan has been
approved.
   (E)   Site plan approval.
      (1)   Purpose of site plan approval. The purpose of the site plan is to
designate the controls for development of the planned unit development. The
site plan shall show the exact location of each building and improvement to be
constructed and a designation of the specific internal use or range of uses to
which each building shall be put.
      (2)   Time limit for approval of site plan. The site plan shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator not more than 18 months following Town
Council approval of the concept plan. The concept and site plans may be
submitted as a single plan if all requirements of §
156.254(B) and (C) are met. The site plan may be submitted and approved in
stages, with each stage representing a portion of the concept plan, at the
discretion of the Plan Commission. The time limit for submitting each stage for
approval may be set forth in the concept plan, in which case that schedule
shall control the timing of development, rather than the time period contained
in this paragraph. The Plan Commission may extend the time for application for
approval of site plan for good cause, consistent with the purposes of this
chapter.
      (3)   Expiration of time limit. Periodically, the Zoning Administrator
shall report to the Plan Commission on planned unit developments whose time
limits have expired. The applicants shall be notified. The Plan Commission
shall determine whether to consider extending the time or to initiate action to
amend the Zoning Map so as to rescind the planned unit development designation.
      (4)   Relationship of site and concept plan. The site plan shall conform
to the concept plan as approved.
      (5)   Procedure for approval of a site plan.
         (a)   Site plan submission. The site plan and supporting data shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   Director review. The Zoning Administrator shall review the site
plan to include site plan review, in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.
         (c)   Director approval. It shall generally be the responsibility of
the Zoning Administrator to review site plans unless the Plan Commission
reviews the site plans as provided in division (C)(4) above, or where a new
site plan is required.
         (d)   Plan Commission review. If the Plan Commission has retained site
plan approval authority, the Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with its rules of procedure. The Commission may approve, deny, or
approve with modifications.
      (6)   Expiration of site plan. The site plan shall expire two years after
approval, unless grading and/or building permits have been obtained and are
still current and valid on that date. This rule shall also apply to each stage
of a site plan approved in stages. The applicant may request an extension of
time in writing, and the approving authority may extend the time limit where
appropriate. Such extension may be considered at the time of site plan
approval.
      (7)   Effect of approval of site plan. No permit of any kind shall be
issued for any purpose within a planned unit development except in accordance
with the approved site plan, and after acceptance by the town of all required
guarantees for improvements pursuant to §
156.254(C)(6).

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the “Town of
Cloverdale Subdivision Regulations”.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.002 POLICY.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Town of Cloverdale to
consider the subdivision of land and the subsequent development of each
subdivided plat as subject to the official Comprehensive Plan and related
polices (such as those embodied in the Cloverdale Zoning Ordinance) for the
orderly and efficient development of the Town of Cloverdale.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be
developed without peril to health or peril from flood, fire or other menace,
and land shall not be subdivided until having access to available existing
public facilities and improvements and proper provision has been made for the
subdivision. Private wells and septic systems in lieu of public water and sewer
facilities are generally not permitted. They are only allowable where
Cloverdale utilities cannot be provided to the property being developed. If
permitted, any such instillation must be approved by Cloverdale, meet State
Health Department standards and be approved by the Utility Superintendent.
   (C)   Both existing and proposed public facilities, serving the subdivision
shall be properly related to and conform to the official Cloverdale
Comprehensive Plan, and related Town of Cloverdale policies and implementation
programs including the Capital Budget, Thoroughfare Plan, Zoning Ordinance and
Housing and Building Codes, if such have been enacted and are in force. (See
definition of Comprehensive Plan.)
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.003 PURPOSE OF THESE REGULATIONS.
   The purpose of these regulations is to protect and promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare, and to provide for:
   (A)   Guidance of future growth and development in accordance with the
comprehensive planning process.
   (B)   Adequate air, light, and privacy, and to prevent overcrowding of the
land and undue -congestion.
   (C)   Protection of the character and the social and economic stability of
all parts of the area, and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development
of all parts.
   (D)   Protection and conservation of the value of land, buildings, and other
improvements upon the land, and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of
land and buildings.
   (E)   Guidance of public and private policy and action in order to assure
adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks,
drainage, and other public requirements and facilities.
   (F)   Avoidance of scattered and uncontrolled subdivision of land that would
result in the unnecessary imposition of an excessive expenditure of public
funds for the supply of services that are a part of the community.
   (G)   Establishment of reasonable standards of design and minimum
requirements for the creation, installation, and improvement of physical
facilities which are, or will be, maintained for the benefit of the general
public.

and re-subdivisions, in order to further the orderly layout and use of land;
and to insure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land.
   (I)   Prevention of the pollution of air and water; provision of drainage
facilities and the safeguarding of the water table; and the encouragement of
wise use and management of natural resources in order to preserve the
integrity, stability, natural beauty and topography, and the value of land.
   (J)   Administration of these regulations by defining the powers and duties
of approval authorities; and the manner and form of making, filing and
processing of any plat.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.004 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This chapter has been enacted pursuant to Indiana home rule and
planning enabling legislation (Indiana Code, titles 36-1-3-4 and the 36-7-4-700
series, as amended.) The Cloverdale Plan Commission has the authority and
jurisdiction to review and approve or disapprove plats for subdivision
throughout the Town of Cloverdale which show lots, blocks or sites with or
without new streets or highways. This authority extends to the development or
re-subdivision of developed and undeveloped portions of already recorded plats
and to any future amendments of such plats.
   (B)   No improvement location permit, building permit or certificate of
occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or plat of land which was created by
subdivision after the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the
provisions of these subdivision regulations, and not excavation of land or
construction of any public or private improvements shall take place or be
commenced except in conformity with the regulations contained herein and in
conformity with Building Code, water, drainage and street construction
standards currently or hereafter adopted by the Town of Cloverdale.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.005 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provisions of law. Where any provisions of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose the highest standards
shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher
regulations, or the determinations of the Plan Commission in approving a
subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and such private provisions are
not inconsistent with these regulations or determinations thereunder, then such
private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and
determinations made thereunder. (Note: private provisions can only be enforced
by private parties unless a public agency such as the Cloverdale Town Council
or Plan Commission has been made party to such agreements).
   (C)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged, invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in any
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other person or circumstances. The Town of Cloverdale
hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations
even without any such part, provision or application.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.006 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as
waiving any right of the municipality under any section or provision existing
at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any
rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the
Town of Cloverdale except as shall be expressly provided for in these
regulations.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.007 REPEALER.
   Upon the adoption of these regulations according to law, all prior
Cloverdale Subdivision Regulations are repealed.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.008 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general
welfare, the Town of Cloverdale, on recommendation of the Plan Commission, may
from time to time amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision
regulations. Public hearings on all proposed amendments shall be held by the
Plan Commission and/or the Town of Cloverdale in the manner prescribed by law.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.009 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the State to this Town of Cloverdale. The developer has the duty of
compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the Plan Commission for
design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land in order to
conform to the physical and economical development of the Town of Cloverdale
and to the safety and general welfare of the future plot owners in the
subdivision and of the town as a whole.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.010 RE-SUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for re-subdivision where future subdivision is indicated.
For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such
change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved thereon
for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan legally
reached prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such
parcel shall be approved by the Plan Commission by the same procedure, rules,
and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future re-subdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller building sites, the
Plan Commission may require that such parcel of land allow extension of
adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of
such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.011 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (A)   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with I. C. 36-7-3.
   (B)   Hereunder, power is given to the Town of Cloverdale to vacate, by
proper ordinance, any such existing plat and addition to the Town of Cloverdale
or such part or parts thereof as the Town of Cloverdale may deem advantageous
and best for its interest; and the power granted shall be exercised by the Town
of Cloverdale upon the petition of the owner or all of the owners of lots and
lands in such plat or addition.
   (C)   Such ordinance vacating such plat or addition shall specify whether
and, if any, what public highways, streets, alleys, and public grounds thereof
are to be retained by the Town of Cloverdale; otherwise, such ways, streets,
and public grounds shall upon vacation revert to the owner or owners of the
lots and land abutting the same in proportion to the respective ownerships of
such lots or grounds. In case of total or partial vacation or such plat or
addition, the ordinance providing therefore shall be, at the costs of the owner
or owners, certified to the office of the County Recorder and be there recorded
by the owner or owners. Whereupon such office shall note such total or partial
vacation of such plat or addition by writing in plain and legible letters upon
such plat, or portion thereof so vacated, the word “vacated,” and also make on
the same reference to the volume and page in which said ordinance of vacation
is recorded; and the owner or owners of the lots and lands in a plat so vacated
shall cause the same and the proportionate part of the abutting highway,
streets, alleys, and public grounds so vacated to be replatted and numbered by
the Town or County Surveyor. When such replat so executed is acknowledged by
such owner or owners and is recorded in the office of the County Recorder of
Putnam County, such property so replatted may be conveyed and assessed by the
numbers given in such replat.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.012 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Plan Commission finds that extraordinary hardships
may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of
these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal,
it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such
variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations; and further provided the Plan Commission shall not approve
variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;

the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan or Official Map as interpreted by the
Plan Commission and the President of the Plan Commission;

facilities, all appropriate public agencies have been given ample time to
comment in writing to the Plan Commission.

such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.

writing by the subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is filed for the
consideration of the Plan Commission. The petition shall state fully the
grounds for the application and the significant facts relied upon by the
petitioner.
   (D)   Nothing herein shall be construed as altering or conflicting with the
powers and duties of the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to Title 36-7-4-900
series of the Indiana statutes, as currently amended, Ordinance or
Comprehensive Plan which may have been developed.
   (E)   In approving variances, the Plan Commission may require such
conditions as will in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.

within the purpose of this chapter.
   (G)   A Comprehensive group housing, commercial, or industrial development,
including the large-scale construction of housing, commercial or industrial
units, together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by
the Plan Commission although the design of the project does not include
standard street, lot, and subdivision arrangements, provided that departure
from the standards of these regulations can be made without destroying their
intent and is in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
relating to Planned Unit Developments.

APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE
§ 157.030 GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Discussion of requirements: predesign conference. Prior to submitting
any of the materials required by this chapter, the applicant or his or her
representative shall discuss with the Administrator the nature of the land
division being proposed, so that the applicant may be instructed concerning the
classification of his subdivision and the regulatory procedures that apply to
it and must be followed under this chapter in order to secure primary and
secondary approval. Where applicable, requirements concerning the general
layout of streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, drainage,
sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters, as well as the availability of
existing services should be discussed. The Administrator should also advise the
applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those
other officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision
plat coming within their jurisdiction. The distinction between major and minor
subdivisions and exempt divisions, as defined in this chapter, shall be made by
the Administrator when the applicant submits an application for sketch plan
approval in the case of major and minor subdivisions, division.
   (B)   Classification of land divisions.
      (1)   All land to be divided shall be categorized into one of the three
main classes of land division indicated in this chapter’s definition of
subdivision. These classes are:
         (a)   Major subdivisions;
         (b)   Minor subdivisions; and
         (c)   Exempt divisions.
      (2)   Exempt divisions are not subject to the requirements of this
chapter unless and until development of any nature is undertaken on the lots
created by the division. As a point of emphasis, any division that would
otherwise be an exempt division that is actually undertaken with the intent to
undertake development of the resulting lots within a reasonable time frame from
the division is NOT an exempt division. It is expressly the intent of this
chapter to include within its scope divisions which may appear to be exempt but
are undertaken with the intent or effect of avoiding the application of this
chapter.
      (3)   Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on
land to be subdivided into a major or minor subdivision, the subdividing owner
or his subdivision agent shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed §
157.032 or §
157.033 of this chapter as appropriate. Before any permit shall be granted for
a structure to be erected on a parcel of land to created or altered by an
exempt division within two years of the effective date of the division, the
land divider or his agent shall certify to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that all requirements for exemption have been met.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.031 MAJOR AND MINOR SUBDIVISIONS: SKETCH PLAN APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR
PRIMARY APPROVAL.
   (A)   Application requirements. In order to begin the subdivision process,
the applicant shall file an application for review of sketch plan and
certificate with the Administrator and be entitled to a signed receipt for
same. This application shall:
      (1)   Be made on forms available at the Town Offices and signed by the
owner.
      (2)   Include indication of all contiguous holdings of the owner,
including land in the same ownership with an indication of the portion which is
proposed to be subdivided.
      (3)   Be presented to the Administrator in duplicate.
      (4)   Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the sketch plan.
      (5)   Be accompanied by an initial fee plus a fee for each lot in excess
of four lots. This fee will vary according to the Plan Commission’s costs for
their consulting engineer. The current amount will be found on the printed
application form at the time of submission as well as by contacting the office
of the Administrator.
      (6)   Include an address and telephone number of an agent located in
Cloverdale, Putnam County or the Indianapolis Metropolitan area who shall be
authorized to receive all notices required by this chapter.
      (7)   Include a listing signed by the checkpoint agencies indicating that
they have received a copy of the proposed sketch plan or a certification that
it has been sent.
   (B)   Checkpoint submission. In order to fulfill this last application
requirement, a copy of the proposed plan shall be submitted to each of the
agencies appropriate to the plan’s location so that their comments may be made
to the Administrator. The checkpoint agencies are listed in Figure 3-01. The
Administrator may request that all officials and agencies, to whom a request
for review has been made, submit a written report to him within 15 days after
receipt of the request. No response from an agency shall be interpreted as
meaning “no objection”.
   (C)   Classification of subdivision. After an application for sketch plan
approval has been submitted, and at the time of sketch plan review, the
Administrator shall classify the proposed subdivision as either major or minor
as defined in this chapter. The required procedures and approvals for major
subdivisions are described in §
157.032; corresponding information concerning the minor subdivision approval
process is provided in §
157.033.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.032 MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   General procedures for primary and secondary approval. Should the
Administrator, during sketch plan review, classify the proposed land division
as a major subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and be
subject to the processes outlined in Figure 3-2, and detailed in this section.
In addition to a sketch plan, which is reviewed by the Administrator and check
point agencies, the applicant, seeking approval of a major subdivision, shall
submit a preliminary subdivision plat to be approved, conditionally approved,
or rejected by the Plan Commission at a public meeting, and a final subdivision
plat which must be found in compliance with the preliminary plat as approved by
the Plan Commission or otherwise approved in order to be signed and recorded.
   (B)   Official submission dates. The deadline for submittal of a sketch plan
and application for certificate of approval shall be 61 calendar days prior to
the date of the public meeting at which the subdivider intends to have his
preliminary plat submission heard, and 31 calendar days prior to the deadline
for the submission of the preliminary plat. Thus, as a minimum sketch plan
submission shall precede preliminary plat submission by not less than 31
calendar days, which in turn shall precede the public hearing at which it is
intended to be heard by no less than 30 calendar days.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the
subdivider’s sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and
possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this
chapter. The Administrator shall request that a representative of each
checkpoint agency wishing to be involved in a sketch plan review be present to
participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration the
requirements of this chapter, particular attention shall be given to the
arrangement, location, and width of streets, their relation to the topography
of the land, sewage disposal, drainage, lot size and arrangement, the further
development of adjoining lands as yet not subdivided, and the requirements of
the Thoroughfare Plan and the policy represented by the Comprehensive Plan as
adopted by the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Preliminary plat procedures for primary approval.
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following the submission, review and
report on the sketch plan application, the subdivider may file for primary
approval of a preliminary plat. This submission shall:
         (a)   Include indication of all land which the applicant proposes to
subdivide and all land immediately adjacent and across any street extending 600
feet there from but no more than two property owners deep to the proposed
subdivision, with the names and addresses of the owners as shown in the records
of the Putnam County Recorder. This information may be shown on a separate
current Plan Map reproduction from the Recorder Office showing the boundaries
of the subdivision superimposed thereon.
         (b)   Be presented in duplicate to the Administrator no later than 60
calendar days prior to the regular meeting of the Plan Commission at which it
is intended to be heard.
         (c)   Be accompanied by four copies of the preliminary plat as
described in this chapter.
         (d)   Generally comply with the sketch plan as reviewed.
      (2)   Placement on the Plan Commission agenda. Subsequent to the
submission for primary approval, the Plan Commission shall place the matter on
the agenda for formal action at the next regular hearing that provides adequate
time for publication of public notice.
      (3)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
prior to the date of public hearing, the Administrator shall review the
proposal and prepare a written report to the Plan Commission and applicant
indicating a recommendation with regard to the subdivision being proposed.
      (4)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The Plan
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat and notice of
such hearing shall be in local newspapers of general circulation as required by
Indiana statute in effect at the time of the application at the applicant’s
expense. At the time of the public hearing, the applicant shall submit an
affidavit stating that the applicant has placed posters provided by the
Administrator (advising interested parties of the hearing) at the locations
designated by the Administrator on the proposed subdivision property at least
ten days prior to the public hearing and show proofs of publication that the
notices of public hearing were published prior to the public hearing.
Interested parties shall be notified by the applicant of the date, time, place
and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision as required by law in
advance of the hearing by certified mail. The applicant shall file with the
Plan Commission, at the time of the public hearing, an affidavit so testifying,
along with the certified mail receipts provided by the post office.
      (5)   Primary approval of the preliminary plat. After the Plan Commission
has held a hearing upon the preliminary plat, the Administrator’s report,
checkpoint recommendations, testimony, and exhibits submitted at the public
hearing, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or
additions. The Plan Commission shall at a public hearing, grant primary
approval, conditional approval, disapprove the preliminary plat or continue the
hearing and/or consideration of the matter for a reasonable period of time. One
copy of the preliminary plat shall be returned to the applicant with the date
of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval and, when requested by the
applicant, the reasons thereto accompanying the plat, within 30 days of the
public hearing. Before the Plan Commission approves a preliminary plat showing
park reservation(s) of land for another local governmental unit, the Plan
Commission shall obtain approval of the park or land reservation from the
participating jurisdiction. Primary approval by the Plan Commission is subject
to review by certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until
a minimum of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval.
      (6)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of two years
after the date of primary approval, at the end of which time secondary approval
of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by the Designated
Officials. Any plats not receiving secondary approval within the period of time
set forth herein shall be null and void, and the developer shall be required to
resubmit a new application for sketch plan review and certificate, subject to
all the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations in effect at the time
of resubmission. Upon written application of the applicant, the Plan Commission
may extend the primary approval of preliminary plat in increments of one year
beyond an expiration date without further notice and public hearing. Not more
than two such extensions may be granted.
   (E)   Approval of construction plans and specifications.
      (1)   After primary approval of the Preliminary Plat, the applicant shall
submit copies of the construction plans and specifications satisfactory to the
Plan Commission and in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

         (c)   Storm Sewers. Drawing of proposed system on a topographic base
map, profiles, details of manholes and other structures. Such system must be
consistent with all storm water requirements in force in the Town of Cloverdale
at the time of the application.
         (d)   Water mains. Drawing of proposed water distribution systems
including details of hydrants and other appurtenances.
         (e)   Design summary. 
            1.   A summary for basis of design in selection of water and sewer
mains. This should include anticipated water demands, sanitary waste flow, and
storm drainage. Consideration must be given to handle demands from adjacent
land.
            2.   When existing water and sewer mains are extended to serve the
new subdivision, the subdivider shall provide, as a minimum, equal facilities,
unless otherwise approved by the Town of Cloverdale.
            3.   Should the Town of Cloverdale desire larger mains, additional
costs will be negotiated and may be shared by the Town of Cloverdale. Subject
to the following requirement:
               a.   If the proposed development is anticipated to be part of a
continuing pattern of development that is owned by the applicant, land owner(s)
or any entity in coordination with the applicant or land owner(s) or associated
with the applicant or land owner(s) via common directors, owners or officers,
all cost associated with sizing the mains for all of the development (including
anticipated future development) that will utilize them will be borne by the
applicant.
      (3)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer these
plans to the appropriate agencies for review. Once these agencies indicate
their approval of construction plans, or fourteen working days have elapsed
since their distribution without a written response, the Administrator shall
stamp the plans approved and return one set to the applicant. In no event shall
secondary approval (of the final plat) be given prior to approval of the
construction plans.
      (4)   Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements
shall be inspected by the designated official. Such inspections are required in
all instances regardless of whether the work is performed before or after
secondary approval. Failure to request inspection or to procure inspection of
work performed after the date of this chapter and before secondary approval may
be cause for denial of secondary approval.
   (F)   Submission of documents to regulatory agencies. It is the
responsibility of the subdivider to submit all necessary documents, plans, and
specifications to State and County regulatory agencies for consideration of
approval as prescribed by their laws and regulations. Such agencies include,
but are not limited to, the State Board of Health, the Administrative Building
Council, and County Health Department. The Plan Commission reserves the right
to prohibit final acceptance of the subdivision contingent upon receiving
approvals from these agencies where applicable.
   (G)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following primary approval or conditional
primary approval of the preliminary plat and construction plans, the applicant,
if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file with the
Administrator a request for secondary approval of a final plat. The application
shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the town offices;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof which derives
access from an existing state, county, or municipal roadway;
         (c).   Be accompanied by four copies of the final plat as described in
this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of primary approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by a performance bond or other financial
guarantee, if required, in a form satisfactory to the Plan Commission Attorney
and in an amount established by the Plan Commission that shall guarantee the
completion of all required subdivision and off-site public improvements;
         (f)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Plan Commission, where they have been proposed by the subdivider or
required by the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final plat shall either be found to be in conformance with the
primary approval by the Administrator, or by the Plan Commission at a public
hearing. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the preliminary plat that
received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the Plan
Commission at a public hearing for a new primary approval. The subdivider,
submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval, shall choose as to
whether this review is to be performed by the Administrator, or by the Plan
Commission at a public hearing.
         (a)    Should the subdivider not choose Plan Commission review, the
Administrator shall, within ten working days, review the items submitted as per
Section 3.3(6) (a) (DOES NOT EXIST) in order to ascertain the sufficiency as to
conformance with the primary approval. If the submission is found to be in
conformance and complete, the Administrator shall recommend the signing of the
certificate granting secondary approval.
         (b)   Should the subdivider choose Plan Commission review, the Plan
Commission shall determine conformance with the primary approval at a public
hearing. The subdivider shall request Plan Commission review in writing not
less than 30 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which he
intends to have his final plat reviewed. The Plan Commission shall place the
matter on its next regular meeting agenda. The Administrator shall review the
proposal and submit a written report and recommendations to the Plan Commission
and the applicant; and the Plan Commission, at the public hearing, shall
approve or disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval, it shall
be signed by the Designated Officials. If not granted secondary approval, then
the subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of this submittal.
      (3)   Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a
major subdivision plat, the Plan Commission may permit the plat to be divided
into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the
sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the
plat. The Plan Commission may require that the performance bond be in such
amount as will be commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be
filed, and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount
until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections
must contain at least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in
the approved plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections
not filed with the Administrator shall automatically expire after two years
from the date of primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the
expiration date has been extended.
   (H)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the President
and Secretary of the Plan Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate only after the bond and the construction plans have
been approved, and all the conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required, the President and
Secretary of the Plan Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat
by signing the certificate only after all conditions of the primary approval
have been satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for
public maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans submitted (as
required by §
157.090(B), (C)), and an approved maintenance bond has been provided (as
required by§
157.090(B)). There shall be written evidence that the required public
facilities have been installed in a satisfactory manner as shown by the
certificate signed by the Cloverdale Town Council or the County Drainage Board
that the necessary improvements have been accomplished.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the Subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Plan Commission shall have no
other recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of Final Plat.
         (a)   The President and Secretary of the Plan Commission shall sign
the certificate which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar
of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The
Mylar prints shall be returned to the subdivider and his engineer or surveyor.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence
of the Administrator or his designee to file the plat with the County Recorder
within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to file the
plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.033 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures for primary approval. Should the Administrator,
upon examination of the sketch plan application, classify the proposed land
division as a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and
be subject to the process outlined in Figure 3-3, and detailed in this section.
In addition to a sketch plan, which is reviewed by the Administrator and
checkpoint agencies for primary approval and by the Plan Commission, the
applicant seeking approval of a minor subdivision shall submit for secondary
approval a final subdivision plat which must be found in compliance with the
sketch plan or otherwise approved by the Plan Commission in order to be signed
and recorded.
   (B)   Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application
for sketch plan approval shall be submitted no less than 30 calendar days prior
to a regularly scheduled public meeting of the Plan Commission at which the
proposal is intended to be acted upon. The Administrator shall place such
application on the agenda of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Plan
Commission to occur 30 days after the date the application is submitted.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the sub-
divider’s sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and
possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this
chapter. The Administrator shall request that a representative of each
checkpoint agency that wishes to be involved in a sketch plan review be present
to participate in a sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration
the requirements of this chapter, particular attention shall be given to
arrangement, the further development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided,
and the requirements of the Thoroughfare Plan and Comprehensive Plan as adopted
by the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
prior to the date of public hearing, the Administrator shall review the
proposal and prepare a written report to the Plan Commission and applicant
indicating a recommendation with regard to the subdivision being proposed.
   (E)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The Plan
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the sketch plan and notice of such
hearing shall be in local newspapers of general circulation as specified by
Indiana Law at the applicant’s expense. At the time of the public hearing, the
applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the applicant has placed
posters provided by the Administrator (advising interested parties of the
hearing) at the locations designated by him on the proposed subdivision
property at least ten days prior to the public hearing, and show proofs of
publication that the notices of public hearing were published pursuant to law..
Interested parties shall be notified by the applicant of the date, time, place
and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in
advance of the hearing by certified mail within the time frames specified by
Indiana law. The applicant shall file with the Plan Commission at the time of
the public hearing an affidavit so testifying, along with the certified mail
receipts provided by the post office.
   (F)   Primary approval of the sketch plan. After the Plan Commission has, at
a scheduled hearing, examined the sketch plan, Administrator’s report, check
point recommendations, testimony and exhibits submitted, the Plan Commission
shall, at a scheduled hearing, approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
sketch plan. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the applicant
with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval and the reasons
therefore accompanying the sketch plan within five days after the public
hearing. Primary approval by the Plan Commission is subject to review by
certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until the minimum
of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval.
   (G)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a minor subdivision sketch plan shall be effective for a period of
two years after the date of primary approval, at the end of which time
secondary approval of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by
the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission. Any plats not receiving
secondary approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and
void, and the developer shall be required to resubmit a new application for
sketch plan review and certificate, subject to all the zoning restrictions and
subdivision regulations in effect at the time of resubmission. Upon written
application of the applicant, the Plan Commission may extend the primary
approval of a minor subdivision sketch plan in increments of one year beyond an
expiration date without further notice and public hearing. A maximum of two
such approvals may be granted.
   (H)   Final subdivision plat procedure for secondary approval.
      (1)   Application requirements. Following approval or conditional
approval of the sketch plan, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the
subdivision, shall file with the Administrator an application for secondary
approval of a subdivision plat. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the Town Offices;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision or section thereof;
         (c)   Be accompanied by four copies of the final plat as described in
this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of primary approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Plan Commission Attorney and in an amount established by
the Plan Commission that shall guarantee the completion of all required
subdivision and off-site public improvements;
         (f)   Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by
the Plan Commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the Plan
Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval).
         (a)   In order to be recorded, a final subdivision plat must be found
to be in conformance with the approved sketch plan by the Plan Commission at a
public hearing. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the sketch plan
that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the
Plan Commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval.
         (b)   The subdivider shall request in writing Plan Commission review
no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing at which
he intends to have his final plat reviewed. The Plan Commission shall place the
matter on its next regular hearing agenda. If approved, it shall be signed by
the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission. If not approved, then the
subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his submittal.
      (3)   Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a
minor subdivision plat, the Plan Commission may permit the plat to be divided
into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the
sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the
plat. The Plan Commission may require that the performance bond or other
satisfactory financial guarantee be in such amount as is commensurate with the
section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer the remaining
required performance bond principal amount until the remaining sections of the
plat are offered for filing.
   (I)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   (a)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
President and Secretary of the Plan Commission shall endorse secondary approval
on the plat only after the bond has been approved, and all the conditions of
primary approval have been satisfied.
         (b)   When installation of improvement is required the President and
Secretary of the Plan Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat
by signing the certificate only after all the conditions of the primary
approval have been satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and
accepted for public maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans
submitted, (as required by§
157.090(B)(5)), and an approved maintenance bond has been provided, (as
required by§
157.092(B)). There shall be written evidence that the required public
facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating
jurisdiction as shown by a certificate signed by the Cloverdale Town Council
that the necessary improvements have been accomplished.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he applies for secondary approval and it is shown that the
conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat completely
conforms to the primary approval, the Plan Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of plat.
         (a)   The President and Secretary of the Plan Commission shall sign
the certificate granting secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing
cloth or reproducible Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of
the subdivision plats. The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and
his engineer or surveyor. The Plan Commission may require digital documents in
a form compatible with a digital format utilized by the Putnam County Recorder
or other countywide office in addition to or in lieu of Mylar prints.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence
of the Administrator or his designee to file the plat with the County Recorder
within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to file the
plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT RESERVATIONS AND DESIGN
§ 157.045 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules, and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (2)   The Cloverdale Zoning Ordinance, Building and Housing Codes, and
all other applicable laws and ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions;
      (3)   The Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, Public Utilities Plan
and Capital Improvements Program including all streets, drainage systems, and
parks shown on the Comprehensive Plan as adopted;
      (4)   The special requirements of these regulations and any applicable
rules of the County Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies;
      (5)   The rules and regulations of the Indiana Department of Highways if
the subdivision or any lot contained therein abut a state highway or state
frontage road;
      (6)   The highway and drainage standards and regulations adopted by the
Town Engineer and all boards, Plan Commissions, agencies, officials of the Town
of Cloverdale and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management;
      (7)   All pertinent standards contained within still valid planning
guides published by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity
with the preceding guides and requirements set forth in division(A)(1) through
(7) of this section or with the policies and purposes of these regulations
established in §
157.004 of this chapter.
   (C)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Plan Commission may
require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in a
form approved by the Town Attorney.
   (D)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another jurisdiction, the Plan
Commission may require the developer to procure written assurance from the
other jurisdiction that such access is legally established, and from the Town
Engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that a performance
bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the
construction or reconstruction of the access road. Lot lines shall be laid out
so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   (E)   Boundary monuments, markers and improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
Registered Land Surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches
in diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each
corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following
grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (2)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
Registered Land Surveyor, pipes or steel rods, three-fourths of an inch in
diameter by 30 inches in length at the corners of each lot. They shall be set
prior to the issuance of any Improvement Location Permit.
   (F)   Character of the land. Land which the Plan Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, or other features which might reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Plan Commission, upon recommendation of the Town Engineer,
to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land
shall be set aside for such uses permitted by the Zoning Ordinance not involve
any such danger.
   (G)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Plan Commission shall
have final authority to disapprove the name of the subdivision which shall be
determined at the time of primary approval.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.046 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing improvement locations permits to build on each of the created lots in
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and Health Regulations and in providing
driveway access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Plan Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front-yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivided
lots.
      (2)   Access from primary and secondary arterials.
         (a)   Lots shall not, in general, derive access from a primary or
secondary arterial street. Where driveway access from a primary or secondary
arterial street may be the only possible access for several adjoining lots, the
Plan Commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive
in order to limit possible traffic hazards from multiple access to such
streets.
         (b)   Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as
to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on primary or secondary
arterials.
   (D)   Soil preservation, grading and seeding.
      (1)   Soil preservation and final grading. 
         (a)   No certificates of occupancy shall be issued until final grading
has been completed in accordance with the approved construction plans and the
lot covered with top soil having an average depth of at least six inches which
shall contain no particles over two inches in diameter over that portion not
covered by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been
changed or natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed
from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to
provide at least six inches of cover in those areas between the sidewalks and
curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
         (b)   Any lot in excess of one acre will be required to comply with
all State and Federal erosion control measures.
      (2)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the
lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for
in the approved construction plans.
      (3)   Lawn-grass seed and sod.
         (a)   Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less than four pounds to
each 1,000 square feet of land area. The seed to be sown shall be consistent
with the season of the year when the property is completed. The seed shall
consist of a combination of quick germinating annual and slower germinating
permanent grass that will assure coverage of the entire lot that is not covered
by buildings or other structures. All seed shall have been tested for
germination within one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing
shall be on the label. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge of the
unpaved right-of-way to the back property line. No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued until spreading of top soil and seeding of lawn has been
completed. In the event that construction is completed under weather conditions
that make seeding impossible, the applicant shall submit an agreement in
writing signed by the developer and the property owner, with a copy to the Plan
Commission, that spreading of top soil an seeding of the lawn will be done
immediately upon the end of the particular weather conditions, and leave a cash
escrow for performance in such amount as shall be determined by the Plan
Commission. Sod may be used to comply with any requirement of seeding set forth
herein.
         (b)   The developer and/or builder is responsible for assuring that a
reasonable grass cover is established as soon as practical but in any event
within 12 months following substantial completion of the construction.
   (E)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within
a subdivision, not shall any be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (F)   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Plan Commission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards
established by the Town Engineer and shall be noted as to height and material
on the final plat. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until said fence
improvements have been duly installed.
   (G)   Bodies of water and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains
a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute
the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Plan Commission may approve an alternative allocation of interests whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so
placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No part of
the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied
by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area
of a lot from the street from which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure, of a design approved by the Town
Engineer.
   (H)   Performance bond to include lot improvement. The performance bond
shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained
in Section 4.2 of these regulations including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of
debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the Plan
Commission. Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the
expiration of the performance bond, the Town of Cloverdale may enforce the
provisions of the bond where compliance with the provisions of this section or
any other applicable law, ordinance, or regulation has not occurred. (See also
§
157.090(B)(4) for an alternative to the Performance Bond).
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.047 STREETS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Frontage on improved streets. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from:
         (a)   An existing state, county, or township highway, or Town of
Cloverdale street; or
         (b)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Plan Commission and
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder. Such street or highway must be
suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulation specifications,
or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under these
regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these regulations or
as indicated in the Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever the area to be subdivided is to
use an existing street frontage, such street shall be suitably improved as
provided herein above.
   (B)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the Town of Cloverdale’s construction standards and specifications
and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the Town Engineer in
accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to
secondary approval.
   (C)   Topography and arrangement.
      (1)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and sharp curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established in
the Thoroughfare Plan and/or Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   All arterials and collector streets shall be properly related to
the pattern of existing and proposed land uses, to population densities and to
special traffic generators including, without limitation, traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers.
      (4)   Minor or local streets which do not serve also as collectors shall
be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use
by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to
require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe
access to the property.
      (5)   Rigid, rectangular “gridiron” street patterns are generally to be
avoided, and the use of casually curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or loop
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable
layout and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land, innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns (e.g.: non-grid rectilinear, trapezoidal,
polygonal, or other geometric patterns) shall be encouraged where they are
likely to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those using them.
Particular attention shall be paid to issues relating to natural vehicular
traffic control. Recognizing the tendency of drivers to travel faster on
straight stretches of road, road grids shall be designed that utilize the
natural tendency of drivers to drive slower where the field of vision is
limited by gradual curves. Road grids shall also be designed with attention to
ease of ingress and egress.
      (6)   Proposed collector streets shall, where appropriate, be extended to
the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless this is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Plan
Commission such extension(s) is/are not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision under consideration with the
existing street layout or for the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts (see division (K) of this section).
      (7)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access ways shall be planed in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways, and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
   (D)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads and waterways.
      (2)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,600 feet nor be less than
400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along arterials and collector
streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length.
      (3)   In blocks over 800 feet long the Plan Commission may require the
reservation of easements through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities, or pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than
ten feet wide, may be required by the Plan Commission through the center of
blocks more than 800 feet long or at other appropriate locations and at the
ends of the cul-de-sacs where deemed essential to provide for circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other
community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such
length and width as may be determined to be suitable by the Plan Commission for
prospective use.
   (E)   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided and
lots on the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple family residential areas entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and
such entrances shall be widely spaced.
   (F)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Plan Commission may
require that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of the lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street. Where there is required, no access
shall be provided from the primary arterial and screening shall be provided
within a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots:
      (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs or loop streets, entered from and designed
generally to be at right angles to an access street which is at some distance
from and parallel to the arterial street with the rear lines of their terminal
lots backing onto the major arterial.
      (3)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass strip and having
access thereto at widely spaced suitable points).
   (G)   Street names. The sketch plan, as submitted, shall indicate names of
proposed streets. As part of his review the Administrator shall refer proposed
street names to the local postmaster and the Putnam County “911” administrator
for their comments regarding duplication of names or possible confusion. After
reviewing them the Administrator shall inform the subdivider of his
recommendations for their possible revision during the sketch plan review.
Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other
street names in the Town of Cloverdale or other nearby areas so as to avoid
confusion. A street which is, or is planned as, a continuation of an existing
street shall bear the same name.
   (H)   Street regulatory signs. The applicant shall provide and install a
street sign at every street intersection within the subdivision. Specific
locations are to be approved by the Cloverdale Utility Manager. The Town of
Cloverdale shall inspect and approve all street signs before issuance of
certificates of occupancy for any residence on the approved streets.
   (I)   Street lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Cloverdale
Utility Manager. Street light standards and fixtures
shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the minimum design standards utilized
by the local electric utility for the least expensive utility provided standard
and fixture.
   (J)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access to it from
adjacent property if such street is a local street rather than a collector or
arterial street (see divisions (E) and (F) of this section).
   (K)   Construction of streets.
      (1)   Construction of streets other than cul-de-sacs. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between
adjacent subdivisions or other properties when such continuation is necessary
for the convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient
provision of utilities, or where such continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
be a dead-end (stub) street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be provided for
all such temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat
that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters
whenever the street is continued. Temporary turnarounds must be provided at he
ends of such stub streets. The Plan Commission may limit the length of
temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards in these
regulations.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs (permanent dead-end streets). A street that does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision because its continuation is not
required for access to adjoining property shall terminate at least 50 feet from
the boundary of the subdivision. The Plan Commission may require the
reservation of an easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic or utilities from the end of the cul-de-sac to the boundary of the
subdivision. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with Town of Cloverdale construction
standards and specifications available from the Administrator’s office. For
greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection,
permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in
accordance with the design standards in these regulations.
   (L)   Design standards. In order to provide for streets of suitable
location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access for police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and
street-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate street location in order to
achieve a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties,
the following design standards for streets are hereby required. (Street
classifications are indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan.)
      (1)   Street surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and
gutters and shall surface or cause the roadways to be surfaced to the widths
prescribed in these regulations. Said surfacing shall be of such character as
is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements
in the surrounding areas. Types of pavements shall be as determined by the Town
Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains and bridges.
All street pavement, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds,
and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications
adopted by the Plan Commission, Town Engineer, or the Town of Cloverdale and
shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by
the developer for plat approval.
      (2)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designed in this regulation shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes.
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (3)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
         (a)   In residential districts a buffer strip at least ten feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the zoning
district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated on the plat: ‘This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structures hereon other than earth berms walls, fences and other landscape
screening devices approved by the Plan Commission is prohibited.”
         (b)   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad
shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance from the railroad to
ensure a suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (c)   Streets parallel to a railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of a least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (4)   Intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet from the intersecting
street. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless
specifically approved by the Plan Commission.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has
separated, dual drive, without median breaks at either such intersection. Where
local streets intersect with major streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (c)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least 20 feet; the minimum curb radius at an intersection involving
a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
         (d)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
         (e)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trimming trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-
of-way to the extent seemed necessary by the Engineer to provide an adequate
sight distance.
         (f)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% or less.
      (5)   Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Plan Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant
without reimbursement from the Town of Cloverdale. The sharing of expense for
the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as
determined by the Plan Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between
the Town of Cloverdale and the applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the
applicant pro-rata as the percentage of his land to be developed and so served.
   (M)   Street dedications and reservations. 
      (1)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Plan Commission
may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and
dedicates the entire required right-of-way width within his own subdivision’s
boundaries.
      (2)   Widening and realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow street or when the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare
Plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
of a street that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate such streets at his own
expense. Such frontage streets and other streets on which subdivision lots
front shall be improved and dedicated by the applicants at his own expense to
the full width required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserve for any
street purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or area requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance.

§ 157.048 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any
development or subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for
discharging storm or flood water using storm sewers, channels, detention basins
or other approved conveyance systems. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed in accordance with
the Town of Cloverdale’s Design Standards for Storm Water & Subsurface
Drainage, and a copy of the design computations shall be submitted along with
the plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across
or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the
gutter and at locations where the encroachment of storm water into the street
disrupts traffic. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded
at a location, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that location
and catch basins or inlets shall be installed to intercept flow. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Plan Commission to
carry away, by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist,
either previously to, or as a result of development. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of the width specified in the Town of Cloverdale Design
Standards for Stormwater and Subsurface Drainage, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the Town’s Design and Construction Standards and specifications
currently or hereafter adopted.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers. Where a public storm sewer of
adequate size and capacity is accessible, the applicant shall install storm
sewer facilities for the project and make a connection to the public storm
sewer system. If no storm sewers of adequate size and capacity are located
within a reasonable distance from the project, the applicant shall make
provisions for the disposal of storm water, subject to the approval of the Town
of Cloverdale.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
development. The developer shall determine the necessary size of the facility,
based on the provisions of the required construction standards and
specifications, assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The developer shall determine
the effect of each proposed development on existing drainage facilities outside
the area of the development. County drainage studies together with such other
studies as may be available and appropriate may serve as a guide to needed
improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development will exceed the capacity of an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Plan Commission may withhold secondary approval of the
subdivision until provisions (such as a storage facility) has been made for the
improvement of said potential condition in a manner approved by the Town of
Cloverdale. No development shall be approved unless adequate drainage is
provided to a drainage water course or facility having adequate capacity.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the flood plan, but
contain soils which are subject to flooding, may be approved for development by
the Plan Commission, provided that the developer fills the affected areas of
said development to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets
two feet above ponding levels subject to approval of the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, if applicable.
      (6)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the Putnam County
Soil and Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type
construction, unless the Plan Commission determines that appropriate
engineering techniques will be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (7)   Floodway area. If a development is proposed within the flood plain
of a stream or watercourse, the floodway portion of the flood plain shall be
preserved and not diminished in capacity by filing or obstruction, except as
approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources in writing. No
residential building site may be located within the floodway. Ordinances
governing regulation of development within the flood plain of a stream or
watercourse shall be applicable to the development.
      (8)   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an
area of the flood plain designated as a floodway fringe, the Plan Commission
may approve such subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated
sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for
residential usage have a flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory
flood elevation; where provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are
constructed to eliminate contamination of or by, flood water; and, approval to
fill the area from the Natural Resources Plan Commission has been obtained in
writing. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for
computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (9)   Flood plain areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area
of the flood plain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not
been made, the Plan Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all
streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all
lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by flood water; and filling to achieve the above will not
raise the level of the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one
foot for that reach of the stream. All filling in the flood plain must be
approved in writing by the Indiana Natural Resources Plan Commission. Lands
below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area
replacement for any lot.
      (10)   Recording of plats in the flood plain floodway fringe. All final
plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that of the
regulatory flood boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is
drawn, shall include, in detail, all of the information necessary to set out
the location and nature of the regulatory flood boundaries upon the final plat
for recording.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage course, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided granting or dedicating to the public or
the Town of Cloverdale said area in an amount conforming substantially to the
lines of such watercourse and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose of both drainage and maintenance of the right-of-way.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way;
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 fee in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses of a width
to be determined by the Plan Commission and, in the case of legal drains, the
County Drainage Board.
         (c)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured by
the developer and indicated on the plat.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be included for
computing the area requirement for any individual lot.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.049 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   The applicant shall take all actions necessary to extend or create
a water-supply district for the purpose of providing a water-supply system
capable of providing for domestic water use and fire protection.
      (2)   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) conforming to the
requirements and specifications of the Town Engineer and /or State Authorities.
All water mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
      (3)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the Cloverdale Utility
Board.
      (4)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, water
supply improvements, and the boundary lines of proposed districts indicating
all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the preliminary plat
and the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
      (5)   The design of all water facilities shall conform to or exceed the
standards described in the latest edition of Recommend Standards for Water
Works as published by Health Education Service, Inc., Albany, New York, and the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management requirements
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   In low-density zoning districts, if a public water system is not
available, at the discretion of the Plan Commission, individual wells may be
used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision.
Water sample test results shall be submitted to the County Health Department
for its approval and individual wells and central water systems shall be
approved by the appropriate health authorities. These approvals shall be
submitted to the Plan Commission.
      (2)   If the Plan Commission requires that a connection to a public water
main be eventually provided as a condition for approval of an individual well
or central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives secondary approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to insure compliance.
   (C)   Fire hydrants. Hydrants should be provided at each street intersection
and at intermediate points between intersections as recommended by the State
Insurance Services Office and the Town Engineer. Generally, hydrant spacing may
range from 350 to 600 feet depending on the nature of the area being served as
determined by the Town Engineer.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.050 SEWERAGE FACILITIES,
   (A)   General requirements. The developer shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the Town of Cloverdale Construction
Standards and Specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with
the rules, regulations, and standards of the Town of Cloverdale, the latest
edition of the Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities as published by
Health Education Service, Inc., Albany, New Your, and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management requirements.
   (B)   Sanitary sewerage system requirements. Where provided, sanitary
sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems and
shall be installed to serve each lot to grades and sizes required by approving
officials and agencies. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including the
installation of laterals in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations, and guidelines of the Utility Manager and
the appropriate State agency.
   (C)   Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities
are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot
areas shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance establishing
lot areas for individual sewerage disposal systems. Such systems shall be
subject to approval by the County Health Department.
   (D)   Selected design criteria.
      (1)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with a straight alignment
between manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the Utility Manager.
      (2)   Manholes. Manholes shall be as specified in the Town of Cloverdale
Construction Standards and Section 34 of Recommended Standards For Wastewater
Facilities.
      (3)   Sewerage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street
or alley rights-of-ways unless topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes. Where
sewer lines in private easements cross a public street or alley rights-of-way,
a manhole shall be provided in such rights-of-way where possible. Imposed
loading shall be considered at all manhole locations. Not less than six feet of
cover shall be provided over the top of pipe in street and alley rights-of-way
or three feet in all other areas.
      (4)   Cleanouts. Cleanouts will not be permitted as a substitute for
manholes.
      (5)   Water supply interconnections. Protection of water supplies and
relation to water mains shall be specified in Section 38 of Recommended
Standards For Water Facilities.
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.051 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Required improvements.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated, unpaved, portions
of the rights-of-way of all streets as shown in
Table 4-1.
      (2)   Concrete curbs are required for all streets where sidewalks are
required by these regulations or required at the discretion of the Plan
Commission.
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be improved to meet the Town of Cloverdale’s
building standards. A grassed or landscaped median strip at least two feet wide
shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs.
   (B)   Pedestrian accesses. In order to facilitate pedestrian access from the
street to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby streets, the Plan
Commission may require perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in
width. Such easements shall be indicated on both preliminary and final plats.

§ 157.052 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location. All utility lines, including but not limited to gas,
electric power, telephone and CATV cables shall be located under ground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing lines are located above ground,
except on public roads and rights-of-ways, they shall be removed and placed
under ground. All utility lines and other facilities existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat or sketch
plan in the case of a minor subdivision. Underground service connections to the
street property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider’s
expense. At the discretion of the Plan Commission, the requirement for service
connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be
retained in single ownership intended to be developed for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for
utilities (private and municipal). Such easements shall be at least 20 feet
wide. In the event that there are two adjoining lots subject to the application
of this chapter at the time of approval of the plat, ten feet may be allocated
to each adjoining lot, so long at that aggregate easement of the combined
individual lot easements meets the total requirements of this chapter. Proper
coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable
utility companies for the coordination of utility easements with those
established in adjoining properties.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusions of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. In the event
that there are two adjoining lots subject to the application of this chapter at
the time of approval of the plat, ten feet may be allocated to each adjoining
lot, so long at that aggregate easement of the combined individual lot
easements meets the total requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   All easements shall be indicated “On preliminary and final plats.”
(Ord. 2011-07, passed - - )
§ 157.053 PUBLIC USES.
   (A)   Parks, playgrounds, and recreation areas.
      (1)   Recreation standards. The Plan Commission shall require that land
be reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreational purposes in
locations designated on the Comprehensive Plan or otherwise where such
reservations would be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size,
dimension, topography, and general character and shall have adequate road
access for the particular purposes envisioned by the Plan Commission. The area
shall be shown and marked on the plat as follows: When recreation areas are
required, the Plan Commission shall determine the number of acres to be
dedicated from the following table, which has been prepared on the basis of
providing three acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling units. The Plan
Commission may refer such proposed reservations to the local government
official or agency in charge of parks and recreation for recommendation. If
approved by such official or agency, the developer shall dedicate all such
recreation areas for the benefit of the citizens of Cloverdale as a condition
of secondary approval. The maintenance of such recreational areas shall be the
responsibility of the subdivision, via its Home Owner’s Association (HOA) if
such a body exists. In the event that there is no HOA or if the HOA has become
inactive, maintenance of the recreational areas may be undertaken by the town
and assessed to the lot owners. Each lot owner will be responsible for the
portion of the cost of maintenance of the recreational areas as the percentage
that that lot represents of the total lots approved in the plat.

Table 4-2 above would create less than four acres, the Plan Commission may
require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of
the subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as the
adjacent land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than two acres be
dedicated for recreational purposes where it is impractical or impossible to
secure additional lands in order to increase its area. When recreational land
in any subdivision is not dedicated or the land indicated in division (A)(1) of
this section cannot be provided for due to physical impossibility, the
provisions of division (A)(3) of this section shall be applicable.
      (2)   Recreation sites. Land dedicated for recreation purposes shall be
of a character and location suitable for use as playground, play field, or
other active recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry. It
shall be improved by the developer to the standards required by the Plan
Commission and the cost of the improvements shall be included in the amount of
the performance bond. Passive recreation areas along stream valleys may be
accepted by the Plan Commission as part of the required area if adequate flat
land is also provided for space-consuming recreational activities. A recreation
site shall have a total frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet,
and no part of the site shall be narrower or shallower than 200 feet except for
stream-valley and other linear passive recreation areas which shall at no point
be narrower than 50 feet. The Plan Commission may refer any subdivision
intended to contain a dedicated park to the local government official,
department, or agency in charge of parks and recreation for a recommendation.
Land may be dedicated to the Town of Cloverdale for park purposes provided that
this dedication shall have prior approval of the Town of Cloverdale. Any land
so accepted by the Town of Cloverdale shall be shown on the plat as “Dedicated
to the Town of Cloverdale for Park and/or Recreation Purposes.”
      (3)   Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the preceding subsections of this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from dedicating other land for recreation
purposes in addition to the requirements of this section if such dedications
are deemed to be desirable and accepted by the Town of Cloverdale. This
includes dedications for public use and maintenance. Nothing in this chapter
prohibits the developer from using deed restrictions to establishing ownership
in and legal responsibilities for group recreation areas to which lot owners
have mutual exclusive access that is in addition to the minimum requirements of
this chapter.
   (B)   Other public uses.
      (1)   Plat to provide for public uses. Whenever a tract to be subdivided
includes a school, recreation area, (in excess of the requirements of division
(A) of this section), or other public uses as indicated on the Comprehensive
Plan or any portion thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the
applicant into his sketch plan. Except when an applicant uses planned unit
development procedures in which land is set aside by the developer for public
uses as required under those procedures in the Zoning Ordinance. After proper
determination of its necessity by the Plan Commission and the Utility Manager
or other public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each such site
and a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public agency, the
site shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into the preliminary and
final plats. Upon such a determination by the Plan Commission, the following
procedures shall apply:
         (a)   Referral to public agency. The Plan Commission shall refer the
sketch plan to the public agency concerned with acquisition for its
consideration and report. The Plan Commission may propose alternate areas for
such acquisition and shall allow the public agency 30 days for reply. The
public agency’s recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the
boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time
within five years required to complete the acquisition.
         (b)   Notice to property owner. Upon a receipt of an affirmative
report from the public agency, the Plan Commission shall notify the property
owner and the Administrator shall designate on the preliminary and final plats
each area proposed to be acquired by a public agency.
      (2)   Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within five years of
notification in writing from the owner that he or she intends to develop the
land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a site plan of the proposed
development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of
the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed five years
shall result in the removal of the “reserved” designation from the property
involved and the freeing of the property for development in accordance with
these regulations.

§ 157.054 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (A)   General. Existing features which would add value to the type of
intended development or to the Town of Cloverdale as a whole, such as trees,
watercourses, falls, beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets,
shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed
from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land affected until primary
approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. . The sketch plan shall show
the number and location of existing trees, and shall further indicate all those
marked for retention and the location of all proposed trees on each lot as
required by these regulations.
   (B)   Required shade trees planted by developer.
      (1)   As a requirement for subdivision secondary approval, the applicant
shall plant trees on the property of the subdivision. One tree shall be planted
for every primary structure along each street unless the Plan Commission, upon
recommendation of the Utility Manager, shall grant a waiver. Such waiver shall
be granted only if there are existing trees growing along such a right-of-way
or on the abutting property which in the opinion of the Plan Commission comply
with these regulations.
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall be
approved by the Utility Manager and shall be planted in accordance with the
regulations (if any) of the Utility Manager Such trees shall have a minimum
trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above ground level) of not less than two
inches.

   (A)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall meet such special provisions as the Plan Commission finds
appropriate and requires. A non-residential subdivision shall also be subject
to all the requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Site plan approval
(as provided for under Section 4.12 of this chapter (DOES NOT EXIST) and
Section 6 of the Cloverdale Zoning Ordinance) and non-residential subdivision
plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the Plan
Commission. A non-residential subdivision shah be subject to all the
requirements of these regulations as well as such additional standards required
by the Plan Commission and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, and Zoning Ordinance,
except that where lot lines are to be established incrementally they need not
be shown on the sketch plan or the preliminary plat for primary approval. All
shopping centers and other non-residential subdivisions of buildings for
leasehold shall be subject to the relevant provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principals and standards in these
regulations which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivision, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that the
street, parcel and block pattern proposed are appropriate for the uses
anticipated and adequately take into account other uses in the vicinity. The
following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed commercial or industrial parcels shall be suitable in
minimum area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Proposals for incremental lot by lot subdivisions must be made clear in a
statement on the plat which is satisfactory to the Plan Commission.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement construction shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated
thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Plan Commission upon
recommendation of the Town of Cloverdale with respect to street, curb, gutter,
and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Plan Commission with
respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and
storm water drainage and preprocessing of sewage.
      (5)   Special requirements may also be imposed regarding the storage and
disposal of toxic materials.
      (6)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing onto existing or
potential residential development and provision of a permanently landscaped
buffer strip where necessary.
      (7)   Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.

ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 157.090 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of Improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
Designated Officials, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Plan Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the
Town Engineer, the following: (1) all the streets, sanitary, and other public
improvements; (2) all lot improvements on the individual lots of the
subdivision as required by this chapter and specified in the approved
construction plans and on the final subdivision plat as approved by the Plan
Commission, and (3) to dedicate the public improvements to the Town of
Cloverdale, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and
public improvements thus dedicated.
   (B)   Performance bond.
      (1)   The Plan Commission, in its sole discretion, may waive the
requirement that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the
approval of the final subdivision plat or section thereof, and that, in lieu
thereof, the applicant shall post bond securable to the Town of Cloverdale,
hereinafter referred to as performance bond, in an amount equivalent to 100% of
the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements. This
amount of bond shall be sufficient to secure to the participating jurisdiction
the satisfactory construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of
required public improvements, as provided for in §§
157.032(G)(1)(a) and
157.033(H)(1)(a) of this chapter.
      (2)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the Town of Cloverdale in an amount equivalent to 100% of the
estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public
improvements as provided for in §§
157.032(G)(1)(a) and
157.033(H)(1)(a) of this chapter. Any such check shall be held by the
Cloverdale Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit on behalf of the subdivider and securable by the Town of
Cloverdale in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion
of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided in §§
157.032(G)(1)(a) and
157.033(H)(1)(a) of this chapter. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit
is used, it shall be written for a maximum length of two years. The Plan
Commission, two months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall
determine if the public improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the
Town of Cloverdale or other units of government having jurisdiction over them
and, if they have not been accepted shall so notify the subdivider of the Town
of Cloverdale’s intent to secure the funds pledged by such letter of credit,
or, at the discretion of the Plan Commission, to grant an extension of the
original period fixed by the Plan Commission. No extension shall exceed one
year and the subdivider shall file with the Plan Commission a new letter of
credit for the period so extended.
      (4)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to the Town of Cloverdale and the subdivider to be held by the
Cloverdale Clerk-Treasurer in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in §§
157.032(G)(1)(a) and
157.033(H)(1)(a) of this chapter. The subdivider must endorse the certificate
of deposit before submitting it to the Plan Commission so that the Town of
Cloverdale may secure the funds.
      (5)   A performance bond furnished pursuant to this chapter shall comply
with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the Town Attorney
as to form, sufficiently, and manner of execution as set forth in this chapter.
(See Appendix A for forms.) The period within which required public
improvements must be completed shall be specified by the Plan Commission in the
primary approval of the preliminary plat and shall be incorporated into the
bond and shall not in any event exceed two years from date of secondary
approval. Such bond shall be approved by the participating jurisdiction as to
amount. The Plan Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension
of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one
additional year, provided that the bond submitted for this extension period
meets all other requirements herein. The Plan Commission may, at any time
during the term of such bond, accept a substitution of principal or sureties on
the bond.
   (C)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Plan Commission and
shall maintain same for the period specified by the Plan Commission. Prior to
construction of any temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider
shall file with the Plan Commission a separate suitable bond for temporary
facilities. This bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be
properly constructed, maintained, and removed (except for turnarounds at ends
of the peripheral stub streets intended for connection into adjacent future
subdivisions).
   (D)   Costs of public improvements. All required public improvements shall
be made by the applicant at his expense without reimbursement by the
participating jurisdiction or any public improvement district therein, unless
sharing of expenses is agreed upon by the Town of Cloverdale.
   (E)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions
apply may file a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this Section in lieu of said bond.
   (F)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Plan Commission in the primary approval of
the preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision,
the approval shall be deemed to have expired by operation of law. In those
cases where a performance bond has been posted and the required public
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond,
the participating jurisdiction may thereupon request the Town of Cloverdale to
declare the bond to be in default and cause all public improvements to be
installed according to secondary approval regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (G)   Acceptance of dedication offers. The approval by the Plan Commission
of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance
by the Town of Cloverdale of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat.
The Plan Commission may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes
to this effect. The approval relates only to the real property itself.

inspection per §§
157.032(G)(1)(a) and
157.033(H)(1)(a) that any of the improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the application, the applicant shall be responsible for
completing the public improvements according to such plans. Where the cost of
the public improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the
bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the public
improvements according to specifications.
   (B)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (1)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The Town of Cloverdale
shall not accept required public improvements, nor the Plan Commission release
nor reduce a performance bond, until the Town of Cloverdale has submitted to it
a certificate stating that all required public improvements have been
satisfactorily completed. The applicant’s engineer or surveyor shall provide
the participating jurisdiction with detailed and certified “as built”
construction plans of the public improvements, indicating location, dimensions,
materials, and other information required by the Plan Commission or the Town of
Cloverdale. Upon such certification, the Town of Cloverdale shall thereafter
accept the public improvements for maintenance in accordance with the
established procedures, unless the Town of Cloverdale has reliable information
as to noncompliance with the plans and specifications.
      (2)   Reduction of performance. A performance bond shall be reduced upon
actual acceptance of public improvements, but only by the amount originally
estimated for the completion of said public improvements.

Attorney. The maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory condition
of the required public improvements for a period of three years after the date
of their acceptance by the Town of Cloverdale.

§ 157.093 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued until all improvements required by the
Cloverdale Subdivision Control Ordinance, and/or by the Plan Commission, for
the subdivision, or for an approved section of the subdivision, have been fully
completed and accepted by the Town of Cloverdale. This requirement may be
waived in part, with respect to the final completion of some public
improvements, in situations where the applicant/developer can demonstrate, to
the satisfaction of the Administrator, the completion of a particular public
improvement prior to the construction of buildings would not create a
substantial risk of harm to the public improvement or to other direct interest
of the Town of Cloverdale. Request for waivers must be in writing and signed by
the Administrator to be effective.
