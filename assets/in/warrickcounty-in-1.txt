(BC Ord. 2017-03, passed 2-27-17)
§ 31.14 USE OF COUNTY VEHICLES AND FRINGE BENEFIT POLICY.
   (A)   County vehicles in general. Warrick County owns various motor vehicles
and may from time to time in its discretion provide a motor vehicle to a county
employee to be utilized for county business. A Warrick County motor vehicle is
property of the county and an employee that is assigned to a county motor
vehicle is expected to follow all rules and regulations pertaining to the use
of that county owned motor vehicle including the duty to operate the motor
vehicle safely and according to all state and local laws, and to display
reasonable care and prudent behavior when operating and maintaining an assigned
county vehicle.
   (B)   Personal use of county vehicles; prohibitions. Personal use of a
Warrick County vehicle is defined as all use not for county business and
includes commuting to and from work on a daily basis even if the county
requires the employee to take the vehicle home. Under the Internal Revenue Code
and IRS rules and regulations, personal use of a county vehicle is a taxable
fringe benefit to the employee. It is the policy of Warrick County that
personal use of a county vehicle, other than commuting and other de minimis
personal use, is prohibited.
   (C)   Qualified non-personal use vehicles. All county vehicles which are
otherwise classified as qualified non-personal use vehicles, as that term is
defined in IRS Publication 15B and as designated by the County Commissioners,
are exempt from this section such that a county employee using such qualified
non-personal use vehicle may be eligible for a working condition benefit as
provided by law.
   (D)   Calculation of taxable fringe benefit to employee; commuting valuation
rule. Pursuant to IRC § 274 and Internal Revenue Service guidelines, as may be
amended from time to time, the commuting valuation rule may be utilized for
reporting of taxable value of employer provided take home vehicles. Warrick
County will add the personal value of a county provided vehicle to the taxable
wages of the employee and will so report that attributed income for tax
purposes for the daily round trip for the commutation of the employee from work
to home and from home to work on regularly-scheduled work days. Days not worked
including sick or vacation days, if reported on the employee’s salary schedule,
shall not have use imputed to them for those days off work.
(BC Ord. 2017-05, passed 3-13-17; Am. BC Ord. 2022-22, passed 9-12-22)
§ 31.15 PHOTO IDENTIFICATION POLICY.
   (A)   (1)   Each employee, regardless of department, office, or position, is
required to wear and/or carry on their person their official photo ID badge
during the employee's scheduled work hours. Employees are further encouraged to
wear their photo ID badges when present at official Warrick County functions,
such as Warrick County Commissioners meetings or Warrick County Council
meetings.
      (2)   Elected officials are also encouraged to participate in the
Personnel Photo Identification Badge Policy.
      (3)   However, an employee whose name and department or office are
displayed on their shirt is not required to display their photo ID badge, but
is nevertheless still required, during scheduled work hours, to carry their
photo ID badge on their person, such as in one's wallet or purse.
   (B)   An employee may request to have only their first name printed on the
front of his or her photo ID badge, so long as the employee's full name is
printed on the back of the photo ID badge. Such request can be made in advance
by the employee to the Sheriff’s Department Technician or the Emergency
Management Agency Office.
   (C)   Each employee is required to wear their photo ID badge on their upper
torso in a manner that makes the photo ID badge clearly visible to others. This
provision does not apply to an employee whose uniform or shirt clearly displays
the employee's name and department.
   (D)   Continued failure of an employee to wear and/or carry their photo ID
badge in accordance with this policy may result in disciplinary action against
the employee. Any disciplinary action taken against the employee under this
provision will be at the discretion of the employee's supervisor having
disciplinary authority.
   (E)   An employee is required to replace their lost, stolen, or damaged
photo ID badge as soon as is practicable. An employee whose photo ID badge is
lost, stolen, or damaged shall immediately notify the employee's supervisor.
The supervisor must then contact the Warrick County Sheriff’s Department or the
Emergency Management Agency Office to arrange for a replacement photo ID badge
to be issued to the employee. An employee required to replace their photo ID
badge shall be charged the following fee(s) for the replacement of the
employee's lost or damaged identification badge:
      (1)   There shall be no fee charged to an employee for the replacement of
employee's photo ID badge due to damage or wear and tear resulting from normal
use.
      (2)   Employee shall be charged $5 for the replacement of employee's lost
or stolen non-proximity badge.
      (3)   Employee shall be charged $15 for the replacement of employee's
lost or stolen proximity badge.

the employee's photo ID badge to be taken at, and the photo ID badge itself to
be issued from, either the Warrick County Sheriff’s Department or the Warrick
County Emergency Management Office. The county shall provide transportation to
the Sheriff’s Department or the EMA Office for any employee who requests such
transportation for the purpose of taking a photo for the employee's photo ID
badge.

issue an “advisory” or a “watch” level travel advisory.
   (C)   A “warning” level travel advisory may be issued only after a local
disaster emergency is declared under I.C. 10-14-3-29.

equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government's general fixed assets.
   ENTERPRISE FUNDS. Those funds used to account for operations (a) that are
financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise, where
the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including
depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a
continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
(b) where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and
other purposes.
   FIXED ASSET. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods or services are termed  property, plant and
equipment or fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the ordinary
course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the items (e.g. land, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and
fixtures).
   HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services
at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most inventories
are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute.
   IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS. Improvements to land for better
enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and with a life expectancy of
greater than two years. Examples are walks, parking areas and drives, golf cart
paths, fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, planter underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items. Improvements do not include roads,
streets, or assets that are of value only to the public. For example, Vann Road
is a public road with greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon
county-owned land that provide support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk
down the road for public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not
capitalized. However, sidewalks installed upon county-owned land for use by the
public and for the support of our facility are capital assets.
   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. An apparatus, tool, or conglomeration of pieces to
form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become a part of a basic
structure or building.
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.

(BC Ord. 2021-12, passed 1-25-21; Am. BC Ord. 2022-08, passed 2-14-22)
§ 40.07 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The county and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The cost of
property, plant and equipment includes all expenditures necessary to put the
asset into position and ready for use. For purposes of recording fixed assets
of the county and its departments, the valuation of assets shall be based on
historical cost or where the historical cost is indeterminable, by estimation
for those assets in existence.
   (B)   When an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply
recorded as the amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its
purchase and preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a
number of other arrangements including:
      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price;
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract;
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease;
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets;
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction;
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the cost to be
recorded. For example, in utility accounting, interest during a period of
construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost. Reference to
an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of acquisition
of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For purposes of
recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of assets shall be based
on historical cost.
   (C)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detailed record of the capital assets of the
governmental unit.
(BC Ord. 1997-19, passed 12-1-97)
§ 40.08 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   Accounting controls shall be designed and implemented to provide reasonable
assurances that:
      (1)   Capital expenditures made by the county, its various departments
and possible future utilities be in accordance with management’s authorization
as documented in the minutes.
      (2)   Transactions of the possible future utilities be recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted principles.
      (3)   Adequate detail records be maintained to assure accountability for
county and possible future utility owned assets.
      (4)   Access to assets be permitted in accordance with management’s
authorization.
      (5)   The recorded accountability for assets be compared with the
existing assets at least every two years and appropriate action be taken with
respect to any differences.

§ 52.01 POLICY ADOPTED.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners hereby adopts as policy those
recommendations made by the Warrick County Drainage Board for stormwater runoff
from developed real property.
   (B)   The following shall be required:
      (1)   All stormwater drainage systems shall be designed for a minimum 50-
year one hour storm. A time concentration for each sub-area, based on post
development conditions shall be used to determine the appropriate rainfall
intensity for the sizing of all storm sewer pipes, inlets, and catch basins
that will be located inside the developed area. All storm sewers shall be
installed on proper backfill and with proper cover, as per manufacturer
specifications for the particular materials being used.
      (2)   For the purpose of calculating stormwater retention basins, pre-
developed run-off from the site shall be determined as a five-year storm
intensity rainfall event release rate. Stormwater storage shall be then
calculated as a 50-year storm storage capacity (developed) over a 5-year
release rate (undeveloped). Pipes flowing into retention basins shall be
designed in such a manner that the design pipe flow capacity is not restricted
by the basin pool elevation. All storm water storage basins shall include a
controlled discharge structure for the restricted release rate, plus an
emergency surface overflow at or equal to the basin design storage elevation.
      (3)   The Rational Method shall be used for the purpose of calculating
pre-development and post- development run-off. Run-off coefficients shall be
taken from the Herpic Storm Drainage Manual. A composite coefficient for post-
developed conditions shall be determined by using methods described in the
Herpic Storm Drainage Manual.
      (4)   All preliminary drainage plans submitted will show the following
information on the plat:
         (a)   X-sections of all surface drains and waterways.
         (b)   Surface contour lines at intervals of not more than five feet.
         (c)   Flow direction arrows on all streets and surface waterways.
         (d)   All storm sewers within and adjacent to the subdivision by size,
length, type, grade, invert and rim elevations.
         (e)   Locations, storage volumes, release rates, discharge structure
details and overflow details for all retention basins.
         (f)   All sub-drainage areas inside the development shall be
delineated. Off-site areas draining through the development site should also be
shown.
         (g)   Certification and signature of the design engineer.
      (5)   All preliminary drainage plans submitted shall be accompanied by
the following:
         (a)   A copy of the drainage study and calculations for the proposed
subdivision.
         (b)   A letter of certification by the design engineer stating that
the drainage plan was prepared in accordance with the criteria as set forth in
the Herpic County Storm Drainage Manual and the plan requirements of the
Warrick County Drainage Board.

§ 54.01 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Construction site stormwater control.
      (1)   During the construction process, the soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing
water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates the repair of sewers, ditches,
and streams. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes the
loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
      (2)   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the county.
This chapter will also promote public welfare by guiding, regulating, and
controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development,
redevelopment, or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results
in the movement of earth on land in the county.
   (B)   Post-construction stormwater control.
      (1)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates, runoff volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-
point source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation
of stormwater runoff from development sites. Following the completion of
construction activities, dust, dirt, erosion, and runoff from developed areas
(parking lots, driveways, rooftops, roadways, and the like) will continue to
affect the stormwater facilities and receiving streams, unless post-
construction practices are implemented during construction and are maintained
in perpetuity.
      (2)   This chapter establishes minimum stormwater management requirements
and controls for the protection of the general health, safety, and welfare of
the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This chapter seeks
to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
         (a)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development to
reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank
erosion, and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
         (b)   Minimize increases in point and non-point source pollution
caused by stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local
water quality;
         (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that
flows from any specific site during and following development so as not to
exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
and
         (d)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and
other source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls, and ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and
pose no threat to public safety.

(BC Ord. 2024-09, passed 7-8-24)
§ 54.11 POST-CONSTRUCTION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   Unless judged by the Board to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at the
applicable sites.
   (A)   The post-development runoff discharge from the project site must not
exceed the pre-development discharge, based on the two-year, ten-year, and one-
hundred-year peak storm events.
   (B)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate (when
possible) stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots,
and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical, to provide treatment for
both water quality and quantity.
   (C)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration using structural and nonstructural methods.
   (D)   BMPs must be capable of removing 80% of the TSS load from post-
construction runoff. Constructed BMPs listed in
Table 54.11 are approved to meet this requirement. For the purposes of this
requirement, TSS is defined as particles smaller than 125 microns in diameter.
Larger material is considered part of the total solids load of the stormwater
runoff.
   (E)   BMPs shall incorporate floatables control to capture floating debris
and remove it as part of the routine maintenance of the BMPs. Standalone BMPs
must include floatables control. For BMP systems, or treatment trains, at least
one of the components of the BMP system, located after the last inflow point to
the system, must provide control of floatables.
   (F)   Measures shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Utilize one or more post-construction measures working in tandem to
treat stormwater runoff and to increase the overall efficiency of individual
and specialized measures;
      (2)   In combination with proper post-construction measure selection,
design and development strategies must be selected and incorporated into the
plan to reduce the contribution of pollutants from the project area to the
post-construction measures. These strategies include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Low-impact development (LID) and green infrastructure;
         (b)   When selected, infiltration measures must take into
consideration the pollutants associated with runoff and the potential to
contaminate groundwater resources. Where there is a potential for
contamination, implement measures that pre-treat runoff to eliminate or reduce
the pollutants of concern. Infiltration practices will not be allowed in
wellhead protection areas.
   (G)   In addition to TSS removal, BMPs must also be designed to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) or water quality flow rate. All projects requiring
post-construction SWPPPs shall be required to treat the WQv or flow rate,
depending on the selected BMP. Redevelopment projects will be required to
obtain stormwater approval if the redevelopment activity disturbs more than one
acre. Refer to the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or another technical
resource for further details regarding the calculation of the WQv or flow rate.
   (H)   The BMPs in
Table 54.11 are acceptable for use in the county if they are designed,
constructed, and maintained according to the criteria outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual. It is presumed that these acceptable BMPs achieve a
target TSS removal rate of 80% when correctly constructed and maintained.
   (I)   Should they choose to implement a stormwater control device, method,
or system not listed as one of the acceptable BMPs for the county, the
developer or project site owner must provide proof that the stormwater control
device, method, or system can achieve the target TSS removal rate of 80% and
include floatables control when correctly constructed.

§ 92.32 MINIMUM REPAIR REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Upon completion of the work the permittee shall refill the trenches or
sub-grade areas with sand, pea-size gravel or crushed white rock of a size
numbered 53, 63 or 73; provided, however, if an area to be filled will not be
covered with street pavement or is a sidewalk, and is not an alley, then the
area shall be filled with sand or dirt. All fill material shall be free of
rubbish and vegetation and shall be compacted throughout in six-inch layers
while being installed. All streets shall, where possible, be restored, under
the pavement area, with at least six inches of concrete and above that a four-
inch final surface of concrete or asphalt. All sidewalks shall be restored with
compacted dirt or aggregate as a base and the sidewalk surface shall be of a
material and design equal to the adjoining undisturbed sidewalk.
   (B)   In all cases where fill has been placed but a final surface has not
yet been completed, the permittee shall lay a suitable temporary surface to
provide for the safe transit of the work area by the public.
(BC Ord. 1991-22, passed 8-12-91)
§ 92.33 INSPECTION.
   The County Highway Engineer may inspect the work from time to time and shall
inspect the work during filling and final restoration. Such work shall also be
inspected by the county within 30 days before the two-year security period
shall expire. Any deterioration of the repair or restoration other than that
normally anticipated by reasonable use shall be repaired by permittee before
release of the security.

§ 92.46 PERMIT BONDING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All bonds shall name "The Board of Commissioners of the County of
Warrick" as beneficiary of the bond and shall run for a minimum of one year. A
certificate of insurance is not acceptable for bonding purposes. The bond must
name the Board of Commissioners exclusively and not be subordinate to any other
claims against the bond. The bond amount will be set by the Board of
Commissioners. In general, the following are minimum bond amounts that will be
required by the Board of Commissioners. Where there is a higher risk to county
infrastructure, or the permitted work is much larger or more complex than
normal permitted work, the Board of Commissioners reserve the right to increase
the bond requirement after reviewing the application for permit and before
approving the permit. The minimum bonding amounts are as follows:
      (1)   Open road cut: $50,000;
      (2)   Underground construction, grading, trenching or excavation parallel
to the road: $50,000;
      (3)   Push or bore: $50,000;
      (4)   Placement/removal of poles/overhead lines: $50,000;
      (5)   Tap pit (including a directly associated push or bore): $10,000 per
tap pit;
      (6)   House moving: $30,000 per move;
      (7)   Vehicle weight restriction exemption: $40,000 per mile;
      (8)   Maintenance bonds: equal to the initial permit bond amount.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners will allow applicants who intend to file
for multiple permits to have an annual permit bond for utility work in the
county right-of-way. The minimum annual permit bond amount requirement is
currently $75,000. The annual permit bond shall be written so that it
automatically renews, unless the surety gives a written notice 60 days prior to
the annual expiration date. The written notice must be by certified mail to the
Warrick County Board of Commissioners, ATTN: County Administrator.

§ 92.47 TRAFFIC CONTROL STANDARDS.
   Anyone performing work within the county road right-of-way must conform with
the requirements set out in the latest edition of the Indiana Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices or the latest edition of the Handbook for Traffic
Control in Construction and Maintenance Areas which is published by HERPICC at
Purdue University. The traffic control procedures must be followed even if a
permit is not required for work in the right-of-way. A permit holder must also
provide all traffic control as set out in the conditions of the permit. A road
must not be completely closed to traffic at any time unless it has been
requested as a part of the permit and a traffic detour plan has been approved
by the Board of Commissioners for Warrick County. When working on a low volume
road, the guidelines in §
92.48 may be used to determine if flaggers are not required on the project.
(BC Ord. 1998-4, passed 5-11-98) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.48 GUIDELINES FOR USE OF FLAGGERS BY UTILITIES AND CONTRACTORS.
   (A)   When traffic lane is fully or partially obstructed by a maintenance or
construction operation, a flagger or flaggers will not be required only when
all of the following are met:
      (1)   The ADT of the given section of road is less than 400 vehicles per
day. If the ADT is not on record at the Warrick Highway Engineering Department,
the County Highway Engineer shall determine if this criterion is met, and:
      (2)   The work zone on any road (except a local residential street) must
be more than 400 feet from an intersection. On local residential streets the
work zone must be greater than 100 feet from an intersection, and;
      (3)   Motorists in both directions can see approaching motorists from the
opposite direction with no sight obstruction. In order for a vehicle to stop,
this means that the motorists shall have an unob- structed view from “d” feet
from their end of the work zone to "d" feet from the far end of the work zone
(where "d" = length of maximum # of cars in storage + distance required for
driver to react + distance required for vehicle to stop), and:
Posted ** Speed d (feet) *
Posted ** Speed d (feet) *
20              310
25              370

50              670
55              755
 
*   These shall be increased for wet pavement, gravel or on descending grades.
**   Use 55 MPH if not posted.
***   These are guidelines based on the Handbook for Traffic Control - HERPICC,
the Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices - 1988 IDOH and the
Handbook of Traffic Control Practices for Low-Volume Roads in Indiana - HERPICC
1984. These are only guidelines and as specified in the manuals, good judgment
should be used in determining when flaggers should be used but may not be
required by these guidelines.
      (4)   The work activity does not create congestion or backup of more than
five vehicles at any time.
   (B)   The work zone shall include all cones making the taper protecting the
actual work area. Traffic control devices, placement of traffic control devices
and requirements for flaggers (including clothing, procedures and locations)
shall be detailed in the HERPICC - Handbook for Traffic Control in Construction
and Maintenance Areas. A lane shall be considered partially obstructed when a
ten-foot lane for each direction of traffic can be maintained.

§ 92.49 STANDARD PERMIT CONDITIONS FOR POLE LINES AND UNDERGROUND CABLES AND
UTILITY LINES.
   Due to widespread inconsistencies in the location and depth of buried
cables, buried pipes and pole lines, these provisions will be standard
condition of approval of most all utility permits where there is a right-of-way
less than the recommended county thoroughfare plan right-of-way. Plans should
reflect these requirements when submitted for permit approval. These
requirements are necessary due to the limited right-of-way along many of our
county roads and the problems associated with multiple utilities in the right-
of-way. The location of poles and guy anchors in the flowline of ditches and
the insufficient burial depth of cables and pipes has become a major problem
for the County Highway Department when maintaining ditches, shoulders,
installing signs and other safety-related items. Where sufficient right-of-way
exists, utility locations shall be as shown on the standard detail sheets
elsewhere in this manual.
   (A)   Pole lines. All poles shall be located within one foot of the edge of
right-of-way. All new pole installations and guy line locations shall be marked
and notification made to the County Engineering Department a minimum of 96
hours before construction begins. Field adjustments shall be made at the
Superintendent or County Highway Engineer's request for poles and guy lines
presenting drainage and safety problems.
   (B)   Buried cable and utility lines. All buried cables and utility lines
shall be located within two feet of the edge of the right-of-way, with all
pedestals being located a distance of two feet from the edge of right-of-way.
All cables and utility lines shall be located a minimum of 48 inches below
ground level and at least 48 inches below any drainage structure. Any variances
shall be requested in writing and have explicit written approval by the County
Highway Engineer. This requirement is needed to allow for the installation of
signs and guardrail, and the maintenance and reestablishment of roadside
ditches. If the permittee does not install his or her cables or lines at this
depth, he or she shall waive all rights to damages incurred to his or her lines
or cables made by the County Highway Department or its contractors during its
routine maintenance activities and the installation of guardrail at hazardous
locations.
   (C)   All permits. Any permittee or permittee's contractor who cuts an
underground drain tile, whether or not it appears to be abandoned, shall notify
the County Engineering Department immediately upon cutting the tile. The
permittee shall then repair the tile as directed by the inspector.

§ 92.50 PERMITTED WORK IN COUNTY RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Definitions. The following definitions apply only to this subchapter
of the Warrick County Ordinance. For the purpose of this subchapter, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
   EMERGENCY. A situation where there is an immediate need to perform repair
work on an existing utility service which has been interrupted or damaged, and
where the failure to perform such work would result in an immediate danger to
life or property.
   CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. Those items commonly used in the construction of
roads, buildings, landscaping and the like, including, but not limited to,
stone, gravel, soil, mulch, timbers, brick, block, trusses, lumber, sod and the
like.
   (B)   All persons who desire to perform construction operations or other
work within the county's right-of-way shall, prior to start of construction,
apply for and receive approval from the Board of Commissioners or its designee.
Permit application forms, supplied by the Board of Commissioners Office or the
Highway Engineering Department, and related exhibits shall be submitted to the
Highway Department, to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate agencies as
specified by the County Commissioners.
   (C)   In the event of an emergency, the repairs of a utility may be
undertaken without first receiving a permit. However, in an emergency
situation, the entity making the emergency repairs must notify the County
Engineering Department as soon as possible. In the event of an emergency during
non-work hours, a faxed notification must be made to the Board of Commissioners
or County Highway Engineer as soon as possible on a county-supplied form. A
regular permit must be filed with the Highway Engineering Department within 72
hours of the time the work is begun in an emergency situation. Any work
completed as emergency work that does not meet the definition of emergency as
set out in this section is a violation of this section; any work completed
without a permit when one is required is also a violation of this section.
   (D)   Any applicant, as required by the County Board of Commissioners, shall
provide a permit bond running to "The Board of Commissioners of Warrick County"
in an amount designated by the County Commissioners. The bond shall not expire
in less than one year. Prior to the release of any permit bond, the County
Highway Engineer will require inspections during and at the completion of
construction. The bond shall insure that the applicant on the permit will
complete all permitted work in accordance with the requirements of this section
of the County Ordinance and any other applicable sections of the County
Ordinance. In the event a permit bond expires or the bond company cancels the
permit bond and all work authorized by any permits already issued using the
permit bond have not been completed and the County Board of Commissioners has
not released the bond, then the bond shall become immediately due and payable
to the County Board of Commissioners. Applicants who desire to do so may post
an annual or continuous permit bond for utility work in an amount designated by
the County Commissioners. An annual or continuous permit bond may not be used
for drive or public road approach permits. In the event an annual or continuous
permit bond expires or the bond company cancels the annual or continuous permit
bond and all work authorized by any permits already issued using the annual or
continuous permit bond has not been completed and the County Board of
Commissioners has not released the bond, then the bond shall become immediately
due and payable to the County Board of Commissioners. At the discretion of the
Highway Engineer, a maintenance bond may be required from an applicant as a
condition of approval or as a condition of releasing the permit bond. A utility
company having a certificate of authority or franchise issued by the Indiana
Utility Regulatory Commission, and who has a continuous bond on file with the
County Board of Commissioners, may use, in lieu of the maintenance bond when
approved by the County Board of Commissioners. Permits issued for the cutting
of a road may require a three-year main-tenance bond, which cannot be canceled
prior to three years from the completion of the road cut. If the bond company
sends notice that the bond is being canceled at any time prior to three years,
the total amount of the bond shall become immediately due and payable to the
County Board of Commissioners and no additional permits will be issued to the
applicant.
   (E)   The recipient of a permit and/or anyone working within the right-of-
way of a county road shall comply with the following terms.
      (1)   Construction materials shall conform to the requirements of the
Standard Specifications of the State Department of Transportation and shall be
approved by the County Highway Engineer.
      (2)   Traffic control devices and flaggers shall be used to regulate
traffic safety if construction affects the flow of traffic as set out in the
Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and as required by the County
Highway Engineer or the County Board of Commissioners. Traffic will be
maintained at all times. If a road closing is approved in accordance with the
County's Ordinance, the permit holder will mark and maintain any detours
approved by the County Highway Engineer and notify all appropriate agencies of
the time and location of the closing a minimum of 48 hours prior to closing and
again immediately upon reopening of the roadway.
      (3)   Utility trench backfill for cuts of the roadway, flowable mortar,
shall be placed and compacted in lifts under the supervision of and to the
specification of the County Highway Engineer. The County Highway Engineer may,
at his or her discretion, permit #53 aggregate, require any additional
specifications, and/or require testing for density by an independent testing
laboratory.
      (4)   Pavement shall be restored to a smooth permanent as required by the
County Highway Engineer or County Highway Superintendent. This shall also
include any damage done to pavement markings. Temporary patches shall be
maintained in a smooth and safe condition by the permit holder until a
permanent patching is accomplished. Temporary patching shall not exceed 30
days, except during the period from November 15 through April 15 each year when
the materials are not available. During this time period, the applicant may
leave a temporary patch in place, but a routine inspection shall be made by the
applicant to insure the temporary patch is in good condition. An extension
beyond the 30-day requirement may be granted at the Highway Department's
discretion upon request with a justification by the applicant. Aggregate
surfaces shall be restored in kind and shall be stabilized to prevent loose
material, which constitutes a safety hazard.
      (5)   The filling of a curb or gutter line of the drainage system of any
road with any material or pipe is strictly prohibited. Any curb modifications
shall require a driveway permit.
      (6)   Tree-trimming operations do not require a permit to work in the
right-of-way; however, they are bound by all of the requirements of this
subchapter and are required to obtain a road obstruction permit if they desire
to close a road.
      (7)   All sod, swale, side ditches, shoulders and other improvements
within the right-of-way that are disturbed by any work or construction within
the right-of-way shall be repaired or replaced in a condition equal to or
better than they were prior to the work or construction. Materials used in the
repair of any disturbed area and the method used to make the repairs shall be
approved by the County Highway Engineer or the County Commissioners. The proof
of the condition of these items prior to work shall be the contractors or the
individual completing the work responsibility.
      (8)   Anyone who cuts or damages an underdrain tile, storm sewer pipe or
culvert pipe, whether or not it appears to be abandoned, shall notify the
County Highway Department immediately upon cutting the tile or pipe. The person
cutting the tile shall be responsible for all damages resulting from this
action. The person cutting the tile shall then repair the tile as directed by
the Superintendent or County Highway Engineer. If the tile or pipe is a
regulated drain, then immediate notification and repair approval shall also be
made to the County Surveyor or his or her designated representative.
      (9)   Loading or unloading any equipment on a county road that results in
an undue or unsafe restriction of traffic or damage to the pavement is not
allowed and is a violation of this section.
      (10)   Crossing or traveling on a county road with a tracked vehicle
directly in contact with the pavement surface is a violation of this section.
Crossing or traveling along the road will be allowed, provided suitable
protection (timbers, tires and the like) is provided for the pavement. No
damage will be allowed to the pavement, structures, grading, drainage and the
like. Failure to use adequate protection or damage to the pavement is a
violation of this section.
      (11)   Dragging or depositing mud or soil onto a county road from any
site is not allowed and is a violation of this section. Cleanup of any mud or
soil on the road due to accessing a site shall be immediately after the
material is deposited. A site having a high volume of vehicles accessing a
muddy site shall have a full-time cleanup crew or install cleaning mechanisms
in accordance with the plan approved by the County Highway Engineer or County
Highway Superintendent.
      (12)   Allowing erosion of soils from a site onto a county roadway or
into a county roadway drainage system is a violation of this section. Anyone
excavating on county right-of-way or adjacent to county right-of-way shall
protect the county right-of-way from the deposit of eroded materials in
accordance with the plan approved by the County Highway Engineer or County
Highway Superintendent.
      (13)   Depositing any construction materials or the cleaning of any
equipment directly or indirectly into any county roadway drainage system is not
allowed and is a violation of this section.
      (14)   Installation of sprinkler systems within the right-of-way is not
allowed. Any sprinkler systems installed within the right-of-way prior to the
date of this subchapter shall be relocated, at the owner's expense, within
seven calendar days when requested by the County Highway Engineer or
Superintendent for road improvement purposes or drainage problems.
      (15)   An individual or agency who has directed work to be done in the
right-of-way shall be jointly and separately liable for all actions taken by
his or her contractor or representative.
      (16)   Failure to stop work for any violation of this section of the
code, when so directed by an authorized representative of the County Highway
Department, is a violation of this section.
      (17)   Failure to provide traffic control, provide a safe work site
(safety fencing, shoring, and the like) or comply with the conditions set out
in a permit, or as directed by an authorized representative of the County
Highway Department, is a violation of this section.
      (18)   A permit is not required for surfacing or resurfacing of a
driveway, provided it does not change any drainage flows and does not expand
the width of the existing drive. The maintenance of any drive and its
associated culverts will remain the responsibility of the applicant or
subsequent property owner and must be maintained by the property owner in a
manner that does not interfere with the use of the right-of-way for its
dedicated purpose.
      (19)   Any improvements installed by permit or without a permit within
the public right-of-way are done so at the risk of the property owner or entity
installing the improvements. Whenever the County Highway Engineer or
Superintendent determines a change is required or maintenance is needed in the
improvements, the applicant, subsequent property owner or entity who owns the
improvements must make the changes upon notification and within a reasonable
time limit at the owner's expense.
      (20)   No improvements can be made by any permit applicant that obstructs
or impedes an existing farm field entrance or an existing farm field loading
area without permission from the property owner. It is the applicant's
responsibility to comply with this requirement.
   (F)   After the application is approved, the County Highway Engineer shall
issue a permit. Once work begins, the permit or a photocopy of the permit must
be on site for inspection. The County Highway Department shall be notified at
least 24 hours in advance of construction and when construction is complete, in
accordance with the procedures of the County Highway Department. An approved
permit will expire one year from the date of application or 60 days prior to
the expiration of the permit bond covering the work being applied for,
whichever comes first.

§ 150.42 HARMFUL GASES CONTROL METHODS.
   (A)   General. The following construction techniques are intended to resist
the entry of harmful gases and prepare the building for post-construction
harmful gases mitigation, if necessary. These techniques are required only in
MINE RECLAMATION SITES, which are defined as land that has been mined using
surface mining methods or underground mining methods, specifically and
primarily for the removal of coal, and land that is contiguous to land that has
been mined using surface or underground mining methods.
   (B)   Subfloor preparation. A layer of gas-permeable material shall be
placed under all concrete slabs and other floor systems that directly contact
the ground and are within the walls of the living spaces of the building, to
facilitate future installation of a subslab depressurization system, if needed.
The gas-permeable layer shall consist of one of the following:
      (1)   A uniform layer of clean aggregate, not less than four inches (102
mm) thick. The aggregate shall consist of material that will pass through a
two-inch (51-mm) sieve and be retained by a quarter-inch (6.4 mm) sieve.
      (2)   A uniform layer of sand (native or fill), not less than four inches
(102 mm) thick, overlain by a layer or strips of geotextile drainage matting
designed to allow the lateral flow of soil gasses.
      (3)   Other materials, systems or floor designs with demonstrated

   (I)   Foundation walls.  Hollow block-masonry foundation walls shall be
constructed with either a continuous course of solid masonry, one course of
masonry grouted solid, or a solid concrete beam at or above the finished ground
surface to prevent the passage of air from the interior of the wall into the
living space. Where a brick veneer or other masonry ledge is installed, the
course immediately below that ledge shall be sealed. Joints, cracks or other
openings around all penetrations of both exterior and interior surfaces of
masonry block or wood foundation walls below the ground surface shall be filled
with polyurethane caulk or equivalent sealant. Penetrations of concrete walls
shall be filled.
   (J)   Dampproofing.  The exterior surfaces of portions of concrete and
masonry block walls below the ground surface shall be dampproofed.
   (K)   Air-handling units.  
      (1)   Air-handling units in crawl spaces shall be sealed to prevent air
from being drawn into the unit.

sealed by the manufacturer to prevent leakage.
   (L)   Ducts. Ductwork passing through or beneath a slab shall be of seamless
material unless the air-handling system is designed to maintain continuous
positive pressure within such ducting.
      (1)   Joints in such ductwork shall be sealed to prevent air leakage.
      (2)   Ductwork located in crawl spaces shall have seams and joints sealed
by closure systems.
   (M)   Crawl-space floors. Openings around all penetrations through floors
above crawl spaces shall be caulked or otherwise filled to prevent air leakage.
   (N)   Crawl-space access. Access doors and other openings or penetrations
between basements and adjoining crawl spaces shall be closed, gasketed or
otherwise filled to prevent air leakage.
   (O)   Passive submembrane depressurization system. In buildings with crawl-
space foundations, the following components of a passive submembrane
depressurization system shall be installed during construction:
      (1)   Ventilation.  Crawl spaces shall be provided with vents to the
exterior of the building. The minimum net area of ventilation openings shall
comply with the 2020 Indiana Residential Code.
      (2)   Soil-gas retarder. The soil in crawl spaces shall be covered with a
continuous layer of six-mil (0.15 mm) polyethylene soil-gas retarder. The
ground cover shall be lapped not less than 12 inches (305 mm) at joints and
shall extend to all foundation walls enclosing the crawl space area.
      (3)   Vent pipe. A plumbing tee or other approved connection shall be
inserted horizontally beneath the sheeting and connected to a three- or four-
inch-diameter (76- or 102-mm-diameter) fitting with a vertical pipe installed
through the sheeting. The vent pipe shall be extended up through the building
floors, and terminate not less than 12 inches (305 mm) above the roof in a
location not less than ten feet (3,048 mm) away from any window or other
opening into the conditioned spaces of the building that is less than two feet
(610 mm) below the exhaust point, and ten feet (3,048 mm) from any window or
other opening in adjoining or adjacent buildings.
   (P)   Passive subslab depressurization system. In basements or slab-on-grade
buildings, the following components of a passive subslab depressurization
system shall be installed during construction.
      (1)   Vent pipe. A minimum-three-inch-diameter (76 mm) ABS, PVC or
equivalent gas-tight pipe shall be embedded vertically into the subslab
aggregate or other permeable material before the slab is case.
         (a)   A “T fitting or equivalent method shall be used to ensure that
the pipe opening remains within the subslab-permeable material.
         (b)    Alternatively, the three-inch (76-mm) pipe shall be inserted
directly into an interior perimeter drain tile loop or through a sealed sump
cover where the sump is exposed to the subslab aggregate or connected to it
through a drainage system.
         (c)   The pipe shall be extended up through the building floors, and
terminate not less than 12 inches (305 mm) above the surface of the roof in a
location not less than ten feet (3,028 mm) away from any window or other
opening into the conditioned spaces of the building that is less than two feet
(610 mm) below the exhaust point, and ten feet (3,048 mm) from any window or
other opening in adjoining or adjacent buildings.
      (2)   Multiple vent pipes.  In buildings where interior footings or other
barriers separate the subslab aggregate or other gas-permeable material, each
area shall be fitted with an individual vent pipe. Vent pipes shall connect to
a single vent that terminates above the roof or each individual vent pipe shall
terminate separately above the roof.
   (Q)   Vent-pipe drainage. Components of the harmful gases vent pipe system
shall be installed to provide positive drainage to the ground beneath the slab
or soil-gas retarder.
   (R)   Vent-pipe accessibility.

rural rock roads are requested a written request to permit rural rock roads
must be submitted in the Office of the Area Plan Commission at least two weeks
prior to any County Commissioners meeting. The request must explain in detail
the reasons and facts supporting the request setting forth location, number of
lots proposed, approximate acreage of lots, sketch of proposed subdivision.
Justification for rural roads may include unusual conditions of the plat such

conditions peculiar to the site that would result in extra ordinary hardship or
deny the reasonable use and value of said land.
   SUBDIVIDER. Person or persons who own all or any part of the real estate
included within the plat at the time of the final approval of said plat. This
person or persons are also known as the APPLICANT.
   SUBDIVISION OF LAND and SUBDIVIDE.
      (1)   The division of a parcel of land into two or more lots, parcels,
tracts, sites, units, plats or interests, whether for residential or non-
residential use, for the purpose of offer, sale, lease or development in a
manner prescribed by this chapter. PARCELS OF LAND are those separately
identified as tracts for property tax assessment. The two types of subdivisions
provided for under this chapter are defined as follows:
         (a)   A MAJOR SUBDIVISION means a division of land not classified as a
"minor" subdivision including, but not limited to:
            1.   A division of land into more than three new lots (that is
three new parcels excluding the residual of the original parcel) per year; or
            2.   Any division of land (regardless of the number of new lots
being created) requiring the extension of an existing street or municipal
facilities, or the creation of a new street or municipal facilities, or the
creation of any public improvements.
         (b)   A MINOR SUBDIVISION means a division of land containing not more
than three new parcels (that is three new parcels excluding the residual of the
original parcel) in One Family Dwelling “R-1", “R-1A”, “R-1B”, “R-1C”, “R-1D”
districts, "A" Agriculture and "CON" Recreational and Conservancy zoning
districts.
      (2)   The following divisions of land shall be considered PARCELIZATION.
         (a)   Area affected. The following divisions of land shall not be
considered a SUBDIVISION. All other subdivisions of land shall be subdivided in
accordance with this chapter as a minor or major subdivision.
         (b)   Parcelization. The following subdivisions are excluded from the
necessity of conforming to the platting provisions of this chapter only after
review and approval by the Plat Review Committee for conformity with this
chapter and the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. Parcelization may only be done
in "CON" Recreation and Conservancy, "A" Agricultural and “R-1", “R-1A”, “R-
1B”, “R-1C”, “R-1D” One Family Dwelling Districts. Parcelization may not be
done on any property located within a recorded major or minor subdivision.
            1.   The conveyance of not more than two new lots or parcels, with
a minimum of 2 1/2 acres, located within a metes and bounds described legal
description deed with no further parcelization within a 12-month period. If the
division is to be a building site, the applicant shall submit to the Plat
Review Committee proof of septic site/sewer connection and water line or
potable water approval.
            2.   The conveyance of parcels, 25 acres or greater, conveyed from
a parcel of land, provided the new parcels so conveyed do not require any new
street improvements, meets all Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance provisions;
however, there shall be no further re-parcelization of, or conveyances from,
the lots or parcels so created. All newly created parcels shall state that they
are not yet approved as a building site and shall be for recreational and or
agricultural purposes.
            3.   The conveyance of land not within a recorded subdivision,
between the owners of contiguous parcels of land, provided that no additional
building sites are created by the parcelization.
            4.   For the purposes of parcelization, the term PARCEL shall be
defined as a separately identified parcel for property tax purposes.
         (c)   Parcelization procedure and approval.
            1.   Meet with the Plat Review Committee with a conceptual plan to
determine whether the conceptual plan would meet the parcelization
requirements.
            2.   If the requirements have been met, a licensed land surveyor
must create metes and bounds description(s) of the parcel(s) along with a
proposed survey drawing of the parcelization plat.
            3.   File a copy of a completed APC Parcelization Checklist and the
proposed plat of survey along with any required fees. Staff will assign
addresses for the parcel(s).
            4.   Three different circumstances exist for public notice and
opportunity to comment on the "parcelization" application:
               (a)   If the subdivider has obtained the signatures of all
abutting property owners stating their approval (or no objection to Area Plan
Commission approval) and such accompanies the "parcelization" plat at the time
of application for approval by the Area Plan Commission, no further public
notice nor a public hearing are necessary, and the Executive Director of the
Warrick County Area Plan Commission may certify (approve) the "parcelization"
plat for recording.
               (b)   If the subdivider has not obtained the signatures of all
abutting property owners stating their approval at the time of the application
to the Area Plan Commission for approval of the plat, the applicant shall give
notice of the right to voice objections to the Subdivision Review Committee and
then the right to appeal to the full Area Plan Commission to all abutting
property owners of record. Within seven days of filing of the application, the
notice shall be sent by the applicant to abutting property owners of record by
certified mail with return receipts using a prescribed form furnished by the
Area Planning Commission. The notice of the right to voice objections to the
Subdivision Review Committee and then the right to appeal to the full Area Plan
Commission shall inform the abutting property owner that he or she has ten days
from the post marked date of the mailing of the notice to submit a written
objection (the address of the Area Plan Commission being included in the
notice) to the Area Plan Commission for an audience before the Subdivision
Review Committee. Only abutting property owners of record shall make such an
objection, and the objection shall be heard before the Subdivision Review
Committee before the objector may appeal to the full Area Plan Commission. An
affidavit which lists the abutting property owners and attests that notice has
been duly given to said property owners must be filed with the Area Plan
Commission along with all return receipts within ten days of the filing of the
application. Two possible actions may occur:
                  (i)    If the affidavit is in order and no oral nor written
objection has been received by the Area Plan Commission on or before the close
of the ten days of notification of the abutting property owners, the Executive
Director of the Warrick County Area Plan Commission may certify (approve) the
"parcelization" plat for recording.
                  (ii )   If on the other hand, an oral or written objection is
received by the Area Plan Commission on or before the close of the tenth day
subsequent to the notification of the abutting property owners, the Executive
Director of the Warrick County Area Plan Commission shall announce, within 14
days of receipt of the application, the date that the objection will be
reviewed by the Subdivision Review Committee by giving written notification to
the applicant and the objector.
Following the review before the Subdivision Review Committee, the Executive
Director of the Area Plan Commission may approve, disapprove (with written
findings that set forth its reasons for denying approval and provide the
applicant a copy) the "parcelization" application, or request the full Area
Plan Commission to review the matter. If the application is to be approved, the
Executive Director shall inform all objectors by certified mail of their right
to appeal to the full Area Plan Commission by oral or written request within
ten days. Only those abutting property owners who have raised an original
objection and requesting a review by Subdivision Review Committee can appeal to
the full Area Plan Commission. lf no oral or written appeal is received within
ten days, the Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission shall certify
(approve) the "parcelization" plat for recording.
               (c)    After the Subdivision Review Committee has met and the
Executive Director has made a finding to deny the parcelization, the applicant
may appeal to the full Area Plan Commission. After the Subdivision Review
Committee has met and the Executive Director has informed all objectors of the
intent to approve the parcelization an original objector who is also an
abutting property owner may appeal orally or in writing to the full Area Plan
Commission within ten days of receiving notice of the intent to approve the
subdivision. Finally, the Executive Director may request an appeal before the
full Area Planning Commission. Under any of these three circumstances, the Area
Planning Commission will hold a Public Hearing at the next scheduled Area
Planning Commission and the Executive Director shall give written notice to the
applicant and any objectors of the date of the Public Hearing.
            5.   If the parcelization is approved, the applicant must record
the deeds when property is transferred in the Office of the County Recorder. A
copy must be submitted to the APC office.
      (3)   Lot line adjustments. A lot line adjustment may be done for changes
to a lot line where the adjoining lots/parcels are platted having a common lot
line and common zoning (“R-1", “R-1A”, “R-1B”, “R-1C”, “R-1D” One Family
Dwelling Districts, Agriculture and Conservancy zonings are done by
parcelization).
         (a)   No additional lots of building sites may be created.
         (b)   The newly created sites must meet all requirements of the
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.
         (c)   The lot line adjustment cannot exceed 30 feet. Anything larger
than said 30 feet shall require a major subdivision or replat.
         (d)   The actual property line is not officially moved until a deed to
transfer the title is recorded.
      (4)   The term SUBDIVISION includes resubdivision and, when appropriate
to the context, includes the process of subdividing and the land subdivided.
   SUBDIVISION REVIEW COMMITTEE. A five member committee appointed by the
Commission for the review of plats. At least one member of the Subdivision
Review Committee shall also be a member of the Area Plan Commission. Other
members of the committee shall include a staff member designated by the
Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission, a representative of the County
Engineer's Office, a representative of the County Surveyor's Office, and a
representative of the County Health Department.
   THOROUGHFARE PLAN. The Thoroughfare Plan identifies the future roadway
system supporting the Future Land Use Plan that is part of the Comprehensive
Plan. The Thoroughfare Plan places the major streets and highways of the county
into functional class (i.e., the purpose the road serves.) In turn, each
functional class has a typical right-of-way width and design cross section
(i.e., number of lanes, pavement width, etc.). The Thoroughfare Plan is used in
the development review process to reserve right-of-way for future roadway
improvements and to guide the design of roadway improvements by the public or
private sectors. (See §§ 154.145 et seq.)
   ZONING ORDINANCE. An ordinance and Zone Map now or hereafter adopted which
divides the jurisdiction of the county into districts, with regulations and
requirements and procedures for the establishment of land use controls.

Engineer or town board of the participating jurisdiction prior to the
installation of any pavement for street construction. Such inspections are
required in all instances regardless of whether the work is performed before or
after the subdivision plat has been recorded. Failure to request inspection of
work performed after may be cause for denial of acceptance of the streets by
the county or participating jurisdiction for maintenance.
   (B)   Basic and street improvements inspection by Registered Engineer. The
installation of all basic and street improvements shall be inspected during
construction by a registered professional engineer at the expense of the

(BC Ord. 2006-05, passed 3-20-06)
§ 154.022 PROOF OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   (1)   If the subdivider elects to install all improvements, including
traffic control devices, before he applies for secondary plat approval and it
is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission that the conditions of this
chapter have been met, and if the secondary plat conforms substantially to the
plat that received primary approval, the sudivider (applicant) is exempt from
the remaining provisions of this section of the chapter provided, however, that
said application for secondary approval is made within five years of primary
plat approval without the granting of extensions. Extensions shall be for not
less than one year, nor more than five years. Moreover, if the above conditions
are met, the Commission shall have no other course than to give secondary plat
approval within 30 days after application for secondary approval.
      (2)   The following provisions allowing for other proof of financial
responsibility in lieu of installing all improvements before applying for
secondary plat approval shall not apply to traffic control devices. The cost of
all devices shall be borne by the subdivider, and shall be installed by the
subdivider prior to any street being constructed, either completely or
partially, and opened to the public.
   (B)   If the subdivider (applicant) elects to apply, for secondary approval
prior to the complete installation of all basic and street improvements that
received primary approval, then in lieu thereof, the subdivider (applicant)
shall file with the Area Plan Commission an irrevocable letter of credit
guaranteeing that the improvements will be completed or other proof of
financial responsibility, as hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   If the subdivider (or applicant) elects to file an irrevocable
letter of credit with the Area Plan Commission to assure completion of all
basic and street improvements required by the Commission, such surety shall:
         (a)   Be securable to Board of Commissioners.
         (b)   Be in an amount determined by the County Highway Engineer and
County Surveyor to be sufficient to complete the improvements required.
         (c)   Provide surety satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners.
      (2)   Any funds received from irrevocable letters of credit shall be used
by the county only for the purpose of making the improvements and installations
for which the irrevocable letter of credit was provided. The proceeds of the
irrevocable letter of credit may be used for these purposes without
appropriation. If the improvement or installation is to be made within a
participating city or town, the county shall transmit the proceeds of the
irrevocable letter of credit or cashier's check to the participating city or
town who shall complete the improvements or installation.
      (3)   Such irrevocable letter of credit shall comply with all statutory
requirements and shall be satisfactory to the Attorney of the Board of County
Commissioners as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. The period
within which required public improvements must be completed shall not exceed
two years from date of secondary approval. Such bond shall be approved by the
participating jurisdiction as to amount. The Plan Commission may upon proof of
difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond
for a maximum period of one additional year, provided that the bond submitted
for this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission
may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond as hereinafter provided.
   (C)   The subdivider shall have the option of providing proof of financial
responsibility to the county by means of any of the following courses of action
in lieu of providing the irrevocable letter of credit as specified in division
(B) of this section: the subdivider may submit a certified check (cashier's
check) to the County Auditor made payable to the county in an amount equivalent
to 100% of the estimated costs to complete the improvements as determined by
the County Highway Engineer and County Surveyor. In this event, the subdivider
shall be entitled to receive progress payments from the funds deposited by the
subdivider of not more than 90% of the value of any work completed; provided,
however, that all such work completed shall have been inspected and approved by
the registered professional engineer or land surveyor responsible for
inspecting the basic and street improvements. The remaining 10% of the
cashier's check over and above the 90% progress payments shall be paid by the
County Auditor upon receipt by the Area Plan Commission of a certificate of
completion of basic and street improvements as provided in §
154.021. Any payments or release of funds by the County Auditor shall be made
only upon receipt of an approval certificate signed by the Area Plan Commission
Executive Director.
   (D)   In the event that surety is required, which shall be in the form of an
irrevocable letter of credit or cashier's check, the time for each shall be as
follows.
      (1)   Streets and drainage.
         (a)   First submittal. Shall be a minimum of one year and maximum of
two years. If a cashier's check is used, it shall be deposited into an escrow
account with the Warrick County Auditor.
         (b)   Second submittal. If the improvements have not been completed;
the subdivider may have their engineer submit a certified report of percentage
of street and drainage completion yet to be finished and the dollar amount
required to complete the work. This submittal must be made to the Area Plan
Commission office a minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration date of the one
or two year expiration time line. The County Highway Engineer shall make an
inspection to verify said Engineer's certification. Once the County Engineer
gives his written approval, the subdivider may submit a new letter of credit a
minimum of ten days prior to the expiration date of the one being replaced. The
new letter of credit shall not exceed a time period of one year. In the case of
a cashier's check, a claim shall be submitted to the County Auditor for the
reduced dollar amount with the remainder needed for the completion to remain in
the escrow account. The time period for this shall not exceed one year.
         (c)   Third submittal. At the discretion of the Warrick County Board
of Commissioners, an extension of one additional year may be granted upon a
written request which shall be submitted to the Area Plan Commission office a
minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration date of the current surety in place.
This request must be placed on the agenda of the Warrick County Commissioners.
         (d)   Fourth submittal. In the event the subdivider can demonstrate
that due to some unforeseen circumstance or hardship beyond his or her control
and not self-created, they may request a second and final extension to be
granted by the Warrick County Board of Commissioners if improvement location
permits have been issued for less than 75% of the subdivision lots. At the
discretion of the Warrick County Board of Commissioners, they may grant the
extension for such period of time they deem adequate, however, not less than
one year and not to exceed two years.
      (2)   Sidewalks.
         (a)   First submittal. Shall be for a minimum of one year and a
maximum of five years. In the case that the subdivider has existing letters of
credit for sidewalks on sections of the same subdivision, the subdivider may
have the expiration date of less or more time than the time allowed to be the
same expiration date of other letters of credit being held on that development.
This will not shorten or lengthen the time period allowed to complete the
improvements.
         (b)   Second submittal. If the improvements have not been completed;
the subdivider may have his or her engineer submit a certified report of
percentage of sidewalk completion yet to be finished and the dollar amount
required to complete the work. This submittal must be made to the Area Plan
Commission office a minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration date of the
existing letters of credit or date cashier's check was submitted. The County
Highway Engineer shall make an inspection to verify said Engineer's
certification. Once the County Highway Engineer gives his or her written
approval, the subdivider may submit a new letter of credit a minimum of ten
days prior to the expiration date of the one being replaced. The new letter of
credit shall not exceed a time period of one year. In the case of a cashier's
check, a claim shall be submitted to the County Auditor for the reduced dollar
amount with the remainder needed for the completion to remain in the escrow
account. The time period shall not exceed one year.
         (c)   Third submittal. At the discretion of the Warrick County Board
of Commissioners, they may grant an extension of one additional year upon
written request of the subdivider and provided he or she follows the previously
mentioned procedure for submittal by the subdivider's engineer and agreed upon
by the County Highway Engineer. This request must be placed on the agenda of
the Warrick County Commissioners.
         (d)   Fourth submittal. In the event the subdivider can demonstrate
that due to some unforeseen circumstance or hardship beyond their control and
not self-created, they may request a second and final extension to be granted
by the Warrick County Board of Commissioners. If improvement locations permits
have been issued for less than 75% of the subdivision lots, at least one side
of each street must be installed for pedestrian safety and convenience by this
time. This is to be certified to by their engineer and verified by the County
Highway Engineer.
      (3)   There shall be no reduction in the dollar amount of any surety
during it's term.
   (E)   At such time all street construction has been completed and streets
accepted for maintenance and sidewalk construction acknowledged, any
irrevocable letter of credit guaranteeing the construction shall be released.
      (1)   The subdivider may submit an irrevocable letter of credit in favor
of the Board of County Commissioners to be held by the Area Plan Commission and
in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of completion of the uncompleted
portion of required basic improvements.
      (2)   The subdivider may submit any combination of an irrevocable letter
of credit or cashier's check to the county in an aggregate amount equivalent to
100% of the cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public
improvements.
      (3)   If water and/or sewer lines are required per this chapter, proof of
financial responsibility provided by subdivider to the municipality furnishing
water and/or sanitary sewage may be accepted as the proof of financial
responsibility required by this section provided the Area Plan Commission has
received written assurances from such municipality which furnishes such
services.
         (a)   With respect to the installation or extension of water, sewer,
or other utility service, the applicant may show by written evidence that he or
she has entered into a contract with the political subdivision providing the
service; and
         (b)   The Area Plan Commission determines based on written evidence

§ 154.035 APPLICATION AND FEES.
   (A)   A subdivider desiring approval of a plat for a minor subdivision of
any land lying within the jurisdiction of the Area Plan Commission shall submit
a plat of the subdivision in accordance with this subdivision to the Area Plan
Commission.
   (B)   A minor subdivision plat may be filed for approval for any division of
land creating not more than three new parcels (that is three new parcels
excluding the residual of the original parcel) provided that:
      (1)   The original parcel was not previously subdivided in the past 12
months;
      (2)   All parcels have frontage on an existing street with an improved
right-of-way maintained by the county or other participating jurisdiction;
      (3)   No extension of existing or creation of new streets, municipal
facilities or public improvements is proposed;
      (4)   It does not adversely affect the remainder or the parcel or
adjoining projects; and
      (5)   It does not conflict with any provision or portion of the
Comprehensive Plan, the Thoroughfare Plan, Zoning Ordinance (both text and
map), or this chapter.
   (C)   No land shall be subdivided if such land is considered by the
Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper
drainage, objectionable earth and rock formation, topography, or any other
feature harmful to the health and safety of future residents and of the
community as a whole.
   (D)   At the time of filing of an application for minor subdivision plat
approval, the application shall be accompanied by an application fee as set by
the Area Plan Commission pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-411.
(BC Ord. 2006-05, passed 3-20-06)
§ 154.036 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Three different circumstances exist for public notice and opportunity to
comment on the minor subdivision application:
   (A)   If the subdivider has obtained the signatures of all abutting property
owners stating their approval (or no objection to Area Plan Commission approval
of the plat) and such accompanies the minor subdivision plat at the time of
application for approval by the Area Plan Commission, no further public notice
nor a public hearing are necessary, and the Executive Director of the Area Plan
Commission may certify (approve) the minor subdivision plat for recording.
   (B)   If the subdivider has not obtained the signatures of all abutting
property owners stating their approval at the time of the application to the
Area Plan Commission for approval of the plat, the applicant shall give notice
of the right to voice objections to the Subdivision Review Committee and then
the right to appeal to the full Area Plan Commission to all abutting property
owners of record. Within seven days of filing of the application, the notice
shall be sent by the applicant to abutting property owners of record by
certified mail with return receipts using a prescribed form furnished by the
Area Planning Commission. The notice of the right to voice objections to the
Subdivision Review Committee and then the right to appeal to the full Area Plan
Commission shall inform the abutting property owner that he or she has ten days
from the post-marked date of the mailing of the notice to submit a written
objection (the address of the Area Plan Commission being included in the
notice) to the Area Plan Commission for an audience before the Subdivision
Review Committee. Only abutting property owners of record shall make such an
objection, and the objection shall be heard before the Subdivision Review
Committee before the objector may appeal to the full Area Plan Commission. An
affidavit which lists the abutting property owners and attests that notice has
been duly given to said property owners must be filed with the Area Plan
Commission along with all return receipts within ten days of the filing of the
application. Two possible actions may occur:
      (1)   If the affidavit is in order and no oral nor written objection has
been received by the Area Plan Commission on or before the close of the ten
days of notification of the abutting property owners, the Executive Director of
the Area Plan Commission may certify (approve) the minor subdivision plat for
recording.
      (2)   If on the other hand, an oral or written objection is received by
the Area Plan Commission on or before the close of the tenth day subsequent to
the notification of the abutting property owners, the Executive Director of the
Area Plan Commission shall announce, within 14 days of receipt of the
application, the date that the objection will be reviewed by the Subdivision
Review Committee by giving written notification to the applicant and the
objector.
      (3)   Following the review before the Subdivision Review Committee, the
Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission may approve, disapprove (with
written findings that set forth its reasons for denying approval and provide
the applicant a copy) the minor subdivision application, or request the full
Area Plan Commission to review the matter. If the application is to be
approved, the Executive Director shall inform all objectors by certified mail
of their right to appeal to the full Area Plan Commission by oral or written
request within ten days. Only those abutting property owners who have raised an
original objection and requesting a review by Subdivision Review Committee can
appeal to the full Area Plan Commission. If no oral or written appeal is
received within ten days, the Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission
shall certify (approve) the minor subdivision plat for recording.
   (C)   After the Subdivision Review Committee has met and the Executive
Director has made a finding to deny the subdivision, the applicant may appeal
to the full Area Plan Commission. After the Subdivision Review Committee has
met and the Executive Director has informed all objectors of the intent to
approve the subdivision, an original objector who is also an abutting property
owner may appeal orally or in writing to the full Area Plan Commission within
ten days of receiving notice of the intent to approve the subdivision. Finally,
the Executive Director may request an appeal before the full Area Planning
Commission. Under any of these three circumstances, the Area Planning
Commission will hold a public hearing at the next scheduled Area Planning
Commission and the Executive Director shall give written notice to the
applicant and any objectors of the date of the public hearing.

§ 154.037 PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF MINOR SUBDIVISION PLAT.
   (A)   A minor subdivision requires the submittal of a plat prepared by a
licensed land surveyor and duly signed and sealed prior to submission attesting
to the legal boundary descriptions and the monumenting of property corners of
all lots (existing and created).
   (B)   The minor subdivision plat shall include the information cited in §
154.038. Prior to submission of the plat, the subdivider is encouraged to
obtain the certifications of access, sewage disposal, potable water and
stormwater drainage. The plat will be accepted for processing by the Area Plan
Commission without these four certifications; and the Area Plan Commission
staff will forward the plat to the appropriate agencies for these three
certifications. Prior to submission of the plat, the subdivider is also
encouraged to obtain the signatures of all abutting property owners stating
their approval (or no objection to Area Plan Commission approval of the plat).
The plat will be accepted for processing by the Area Plan Commission without
abutting property owner signature. However, the subdivider shall (within seven
days of the filing) send out notifications to abutting property owners of their
right to voice objections to the Subdivision Review Committee and then to
appeal to the full Area Plan Commission within ten days notify, and shall file
an affidavit within ten days with the Area Plan Commission verifying the
notification. If any abutting property owner requests the review of an
objection by the Subdivision Review Committee, the review by the Subdivision
Review Committee shall be scheduled; if not, the Executive Director may certify
(approve) the plat for recording provided the plat and affidavit are in order.
If any party appeals to the full Area Plan Commission after the review by the
Subdivision Review Committee, a public hearing will be scheduled before the
full Area Plan Commission; after the public hearing, the Area Plan Commission
may approve or deny the subdivision stating the conditions for denial. If
approved, the President and Executive Director of the Area Plan Commission may
certify (approve) the plat for recording provided the plat and affidavit are in
order.
   (C)   The minor subdivision plat shall be submitted on a reproducible piece
of paper (with original signatures) drawn to a scale no larger than one inch
equals 200 feet plus six copies and a read-only electronic version of the plat.

§ 154.039 MINOR SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL.
   Four different circumstances exist under which approval of the minor
subdivision plat is given:
   (A)   The Executive Director may certify the plat for recording if the minor
subdivision application and plat are in order; and the certificates of access,

(BC Ord. 2006-05, passed 3-20-06)
GENERAL REGULATIONS AND DESIGN
§ 154.070 GENERAL.
   (A)   No land shall be subdivided for any non-agricultural purpose if such
land has inadequate access or if such land is considered by the Area Plan
Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper
drainage, or objectionable earth or rock formations, topography or other
feature harmful to the health, safety and welfare of future residents and the
community as a whole.
   (B)   The subdivision plan shall conform to the principles and standards
which are generally exhibited in the Comprehensive Plan as is now or hereafter
shall be adopted, in whole or in part; and, specifically with that part of the
plan which deals with land use and thoroughfares.
   (C)   The following standards and requirements shall be deemed as a minimum
and whenever the applicable standards and requirements of any applicable zoning
ordinance or of any participating city or town are higher or more restrictive,
the latter shall control.
(BC Ord. 2006-05, passed 3-20-06)
§ 154.071 STREETS.
   (A)   The street and highway design shall conform both in width and
alignment to any Comprehensive Plan or Thoroughfare Plan of Streets and
Highways approved and/or adopted by any participating city or town or the
county as indicated in the Thoroughfare Plan being a part of the Long Range
Transportation Plan. Right-of-way for any such street or highway indicated on
said Thoroughfare Plan shall be dedicated.
   (B)   If a parcel of land to be subdivided includes a portion of the right-
of-way to be acquired for a freeway or expressway, the Area Plan Commission
shall determine the boundaries of the right-of-way to be acquired, and the
subdivider shall either dedicate or create an outlot in the subdivision
covering all the area included in said right-of-way. This right-of-way or
outlot shall revert back to the subdivider if not used within eight years.
   (C)   All streets shall be in alignment with existing and proposed exterior
streets by continuations of the centerlines thereof or by advantageous
development of the area in which the subdivision lies. When continuation of the
centerline is impractical in the opinion of the Area Plan Commission, the
centerlines shall be separated by at least 150 feet.
   (D)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage rapid through
traffic. Straight tangents of more than 1,350 feet are prohibited.
   (E)   (1)   Where it is desirable in the opinion of the Plan Commission to
provide street access to abutting property, proposed streets shall be extended
by dedication to the boundary of such property. Unless deemed unnecessary by a
traffic study, residential subdivisions with 60 or more lots (or dwelling
units) shall be served by two access points, and shall be served by:
         (a)   Two different roadways if bordered by more than one roadway; or
         (b)   Two access points or a divided main entry roadway from the same
roadway if bordered by only one roadway.
      (2)   The Commission may require additional access on any development
where deemed necessary.
   (F)   Proposed streets and highways shall be adjusted to the contour of the
land as far as practicable so as to produce usable lots and streets of
reasonable gradient.
   (G)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
limited (full or partially controlled) access highway, the Area Plan Commission
may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting
contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots
with rear service alleys, or other treatment necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
   (H)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited (fully or partially controlled) access highway right-of-way, the Plan
Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential district, or for
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distance shall
also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grade separations.
   (I)   Minimum street and highway right-of-way widths.

eight inches of rock with side ditches. Subbase shall be at least four inches
in depth using #2 rock or #5 rock with the base constructed of at least four
inches of #53 rock. The intermediate course shall be a minimum of two and one-
half inches of asphalt binder. The surface shall be a minimum one and one-half
inches of asphalt or as directed by the Board of Commissioners.
   (G)   Where granular material of a quality equal to requirements for subbase
material is placed for use as a construction the neat lines for subbase for the
pavement may be left in place and be considered subbase for whatsoever part of
the subbase area it occupies, and the existence of such materials outside those
lines will not be considered subbase for whatsoever part of the subbase area it
occupies, and the existence of such materials outside those lines will not be
considered subbase or base or pavement surface. The subbase and base courses
shall be constructed simultaneously, and in no case shall the subbase be used
as a construction road.
   (H)   Alternate materials and methods may be used to take advantage of local
material conditions providing the depth, the materials used and the
construction methods produce a pavement which satisfies the design criteria set
out by this chapter.
   (I)   When minor residential streets serve commercial or industrial
development the Rural Minor Collector/Commercial Collector road specifications
shall be required.
   (J)   (1)   The subdivider shall provide for inspection by a registered
professional engineer of all street and highway construction. Prior to start of
construction, a time schedule estimating starting date and completion date of
construction and stating the registered professional engineer in charge of
inspection shall be submitted to the County Engineer, the Area Plan Commission
and the Board of Commissioners. Should any change be made in the submitted time
schedule from starting date to completion date, the change must be submitted in
writing and to the same agencies.
      (2)   Upon completion, all requests for acceptance of streets for
maintenance by the county must be accompanied by a certification by the
registered professional engineer in charge that the streets were constructed in
accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the County Highway
Engineer, and the Board of Commissioners.
   (K)   (1)   As a part of the Street Construction Plans there shall be
compaction specifications submitted and included in the design specifications
of the proposed streets. Upon review and approval of said Street Construction
Plans the Certifying Engineer or Developer shall then be required to provide
the subgrade compaction test results to the County Highway Engineer. Said
compaction results must be submitted to the County Highway Engineer prior to
submittal of the Request for Acceptance of Streets for Maintenance. The County
Highway Engineer shall not recommend that the county accept the streets for
maintenance until said results are provided, reviewed and deemed satisfactory.
      (2)   In the event that the results are not provided and reviewed prior
to date of expiration of the irrevocable letter of credit, the Board of
Commissioners may require that the developer submit an amount approved by the
County Highway Engineer to be deposited in the County Road Donation Fund. Said
amount shall be used for repairs of the streets within the development.

§ 154.094 CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   (A)   Curbs and gutters shall be installed along all streets in the
subdivision except where they are judged unnecessary by the County Highway
Engineer for adequate drainage of storm water or for factors of safety. Curbs
and gutters must be of integral concrete or other approved design and the
materials and methods of construction must conform to the latest approved
minimum requirements of the standard specifications or any subsequent amendment
thereto. The minimum gutter grade shall not be less than 0.65%. Side drains
from the gutter (or curb spill-outs) are prohibited. No curbs shall be modified
for house gutter drains.
   (B)   For asphalt streets, curbs and gutters shall be constructed on
prepared compacted aggregate base. The construction on the Street Construction
Plans shall contain an illustration detail. The depth of the compacted
aggregate shall conform to the County Specifications for locally-maintained
roads and to Indiana Department of Transportation specifications for state-
maintained roads.

§ 154.095 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Concrete sidewalks, at least four feet wide, four inches thick, shall
be installed on both sides of each street in all residential subdivisions with
lots of one acre or less for pedestrian safety and convenience, unless waived
by the Board of Commissioners. Sidewalks shall be located within the street
right-of- way a minimum of two feet from the back of curb on curbed streets or
in lieu of the two feet strip the sidewalk may be placed next to the back of
curb provided the width of the sidewalk is increased to a minimum of six feet.
In the event curbs are not required and side ditches are permitted, the
sidewalks are to be located in the street right-of-way at lease one foot from
the lot line. The sidewalks shall conform to the standard specifications or any
subsequent amendment thereto. The design of the sidewalks shall be a part of
the Street Construction Plans that must be submitted and filed at the same time
the primary plat is filed.
   (B)   Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete.
Sidewalks shall conform to Section 604 of the Indiana Department of
Transportation specifications. Sidewalks shall slope one-quarter inch per foot
toward the roadway. Concrete shall have a minimum 28 day compressive strength
of 3,500 pounds per square inch (p.s.i.).

Indiana Department of Transportation Standards. The design shall be shown on
the submitted and approved Street Construction Plans with a note stating that
the sidewalks are designed and constructed accordingly. The property owner is
responsible for maintenance of the sidewalks and any mailboxes placed in the
public right-of-way.
(BC Ord. 2006-05, passed 3-20-06)
§ 154.096 STORM DRAINAGE.
   (A)   A storm water sewer or a surface drainage system adequate to serve the
area being subdivided shall be provided to accommodate a 50-year storm. The
Indiana Department of Transportation for crossings of state-maintained
facilities or U.S. Corps of Engineers for the crossings of "blue water" streams
may require accommodation of greater than the 50-year storm. Any storm water
retention or detention facilities shall be designed to accommodate the
difference between the 5-year storm without the proposed development and the
50-year storm with the proposed development. Such system shall be in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by the County Drainage Board prior to
primary plat approval. The flow in any drainage structure shall not exceed 90%
of the structure capacity, except for basin discharge pipes that can be 100% of
capacity.
   (B)   (1)   Wherever curbs and gutters are provided or when the Area Plan
Commission and the County Surveyor determine the natural surface drainage to be
inadequate, the subdivider shall construct a storm water sewer system with
catch basins appropriately spaced along the streets in the subdivision. Valley
gutters extending across the street surface shall not be used.
      (2)   Wherever curbs and gutters are provided within a development,
stormwater flow in the gutterline shall not exceed 600 lineal feet. In cases of
excessive lengths of drainage, an inlet should be installed to intercept the
water and direct the water through a structure. In design of the subdivision,
provisions shall be made to prohibit the drainage of stormwater across
intersections. Positive drainage shall be achieved and no standing water shall
be allowed. The minimum gutter grade shall not be less than 0.65%. Side drains
from the gutter (or curb spill-outs) are prohibited.
   (C)   A natural surface drainage system shall be permitted when curbs and
gutters are not provided and the natural drainage will, in the opinion of the
County Surveyor, adequately drain the storm water from the subdivision. The
drainage ways should be shallow swales sowed in grass rather than deep, open
ditches and have a minimum grade of 1% unless lined with a concrete ribbon.
Roadside drainage shall not be disrupted by private driveways. The subdivider
shall install a suitable pipe in accordance with the county's Driveway Culvert
Ordinance.
   (D)   In the design of a storm water sewer system for a subdivision, the
present and future expected run-off from the larger drainage area should be
considered. For this reason, it may be desirable that larger sewers than those
needed to service the immediate subdivision be installed.
   (E)   All pipes shall conform to American Society of Testing Materials
Standards Specifications in Section 7, 8 and 9 and Design Criteria shall
conform to the County Storm Drainage Manual to insure maximum hydraulic
efficiency.
   (F)   All drainage structures shall be designed and shown on the Street
Construction Plans with a detail sheet showing the size and type of structures
to be used, including drop structures, culverts, street inlets, manholes,
beehives and area drains. These shall be constructed in accordance with the
plans and specifications on file as well as the manufacturers specifications.
Adequate grade and drainage structure friction coefficients shall be obtained
and indicated on supporting drainage calculations for the type of structure
used. The flow in any drainage structure shall not exceed 90% of the structure
capacity, except for basic discharge pipes that can be 100% of capacity. All
drainage structures shall have junction boxes at major changes in grade or
direction that are accessible for maintenance and repair of the structure.
   (G)   Drainage swales flatter than 1% grade shall use either 16-inch wide,
six-inch thick, concave, reinforced, concrete ribbons or 16-inch wide, six-inch
thick, reinforced, concrete flat ribbons with three feet of sod on each side.
Drainage swales greater than 8% shall have appropriate, permanent erosion
control measures.

sanitary sewer system approved by the sanitary sewer utility or the Indiana
State Board of Health, including a lateral connection for each lot in the
subdivision, shall be installed.
   (B)   If, in the judgment of the Plan Commission, a public sanitary sewer
main is not reasonably accessible, sanitary wastes may be disposed of by one of
the following methods:
      (1)   The subdivision may be provided with a complete sanitary sewer
system, including a lateral connection for each lot and a neighborhood or
community sewage treatment plant, all meeting the approval of the Indiana
Stream Pollution Control Board and the State Board of Health.
      (2)   The subdivider may provide a private sewage disposal system on
individual lots consisting of a septic tank and soil absorption field or other
approved sewage disposal system, provided such disposal systems are installed
in accordance with the minimum standards of the Indiana State Board of Health
and provided that the soil in the subdivision will properly absorb sewage
effluent as determined by percolation tests. The private sewage disposal system
shall be approved by the Public Health Department.
   (C)   If a sanitary sewer system is to be installed, it must be approved by
the accepting utility.

§ 154.101 TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES/PAVEMENT MARKINGS.
   (A)   The subdivider shall be required to provide traffic control devices in
all new subdivisions. The devices shall include, but not be limited to, stop
signs at intersections, yield signs at intersections, dead end signs, warning
signs, and speed control signs. Location of devices shall be shown on the
street construction plans, as a separate sheet, submitted to the Area Plan
Commission as a part of the primary plat application and must receive approval
by the County Highway Engineer and Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   These devices must be installed in accordance to the provisions of the
Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways. The
cost of all devices shall be borne by the subdivider, and shall be installed by
the subdivider prior to any street, being constructed either completely or
partially, and opened to the public.
   (C)   Where deemed necessary by the County Highway Engineer pavement
markings shall be included in design of all subdivisions and entrances.
Thermoplastic stop bars, lane stripings and any other stripings deemed

§ 154.146 CLASSIFICATIONS.
   (A)   State/Federal Principal Arterial (NHS).
      (1)   The State/Federal Arterial class has been split into the Principal
Arterial Class and Other Arterial Class to better reflect the state/federal
functional designation of highways. State/Federal Principal Arterials are part
of the national highway system, and may be freeways with full access control,
(i.e., grade separation of all crossroads and railroads and interchanges with
select crossroads), expressways with some at-grade signalized intersections
with full access control, or multiple-lane divided arterials with partial
access control. This class would be equivalent to the arterial or expressway
with full controlled access.
      (2)   The Principal Arterials under the state/federal functional
classification are I-64, I-164 and S.R. 66. The right-of-way requirements and
design cross sections for these highways vary. (The total setback shall be
determined by the state or the federal government, whichever is appropriate).
   (B)   Other State/Federal Arterial. The Other State/Federal Arterial
designation applies to the United States and state designated routes that are
not Principal Arterials. This class includes minor arterials and major
arterials under the state/federal functional classification system that are
maintained by the state. In the county, these facilities are S.R. 57, S.R. 61,
S.R. 62, S.R. 68, S.R. 161, S.R. 261 and S.R. 662. The right-of-way
requirements and design cross section for these highways vary. (The total
setback shall be determined by the state.) This class would be equivalent to
the arterial or expressway with partially controlled access.
   (C)   Arterial. This class contains four lane roads that are not designated
as state or federal routes. In the county, Epworth Road from S.R. 66 to
Telephone Road is the only road in this class. This class is equivalent to the
primary class with dual roadway.
   (D)   Urban major collector. This class generally contains two lane roads
under the maintenance of the county that are in the urbanized portions of the
county. These roads are to collect traffic from local streets and get the
traffic to the arterial system. This class is equivalent to the primary class
with single roadway in an urban area. Since these roads are in the urban areas,
they would have roadside ditches/curb and gutter requiring additional right-of-
way.
   (E)   Rural major collector. This class contains two lane roads under the
maintenance of the county that are in the rural portions of the county. These
roads are to collect traffic from local streets and get the traffic to the
arterial system. This class is equivalent to the primary class with single
roadway in a rural area. Since these roads are in the rural areas, they would
have roadside ditches requiring additional right-of-way than the urban major
collectors.
   (F)   Rural minor collector. This class contains two lane roads under the
maintenance of the county that are in the rural portions of the county. These
roads are to collect traffic from local streets and get the traffic to major
collectors or arterials. These roads have generally lower traffic volumes than
major collectors and the design standards are different than major collectors.
This class is equivalent to the secondary class of street.
