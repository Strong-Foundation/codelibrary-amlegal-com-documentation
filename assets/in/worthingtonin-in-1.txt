§ 10.01  TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“Worthington town code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified
ordinances”, or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

§ 10.06  SEVERABILITY.

or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.

whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or

liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.

§ 10.09  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12  LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,

contribution of surface and storm water runoff from a given parcel to the
town’s storm water system. This storm water user fee rate is designed to
recover and be able to pay the cost of rendering storm water service to the
users of the storm water system, and shall be the basis for assessment of the
town’s storm water system user fee. This rate is established so as to maintain
adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected variations in the
cost of providing services, as well as variation in the demand for services.
This rate shall be evaluated annually as to its sufficiency to satisfy the
needs of the storm water system.
   (B)   The following methods may be used to determine the nonresidential
factors:
      (1)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using on-site
measurements of the apparent outside boundaries of the parcel or impervious
area in or on such developed parcel, respectively, made by the town or on its
behalf;
      (2)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using the
dimensions of the parcel or impervious area in or on the parcels which are set
forth and contained in the records of the office of the County Assessor;
      (3)   Estimation, calculation, and computation of the parcel size or
impervious area using aerial photography or photogrammetry, or using the
information and data from on-site measurements of like or similar property or
features or as contained in the records of the town or county; or
      (4)   Computation of parcel size or impervious area using data provided
by the owner, tenant, or developer. The authorized official may require
additional information as necessary to make the determination.

permits and report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules
and regulations adopted by the USEPA published in the Federal Register October
16, 1973 (and any subsequent revisions subject to approval by the town). In the
event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24- hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (G)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance.

§ 151.15  RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.
   (A)   The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without
the written consent of the President of the Council members and the owner of
the utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing utility, this
shall be done by its owner. No facility owned by the town shall be moved to
accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the
permittee. The cost of moving privately-owned utilities shall be similarly
borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person
owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or
otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be in
any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to
support, sustain, and protect them under, over, along, or across said work. The
permittee shall secure approval of method of support and protection from the
owner of the utility.
   (B)   In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or apparatus should
be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement of devices
are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly
notify the owner thereof. All damaged utilities shall be repaired by the agency
or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the
permittee. It is the intent of this division (B) that the permittee shall
assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or
injury to anyone because of such utility damage and such assumption of
liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee, the only exception will
be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the
owning utility. The town shall not be made a party to any action because of
this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and
location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage.

controlling, or having an interest therein shall, within 30 days after such
abandonment, file with the President of the Council members a statement in
writing giving in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such
abandoned substructure is in the way, or subsequently becomes in the way, or an
installation is pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove
such abandoned substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of
excavation for construction of the utility by the town or any other public
body.

   (A)   The permittee shall at all times and at his, her, or its own expense
preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper
foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the
protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for
the purpose of taking appropriate protecting measures, the permittee shall
obtain consent from the owner of such private property for such purpose and, if
he or she cannot obtain such consent, the President of the Council members may
authorize him or her to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of
making the property safe.
   (B)   The permittee shall, at his, her, or its own expense shore up and
protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other properly likely to be damaged
during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all
damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure
properly to protect and carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for
the permittee to trench through any lawn, said area shall be reseeded or sod
shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this chapter. All construction and maintenance work
shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and
debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before
such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or
shrubs which exist in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent
of the appropriate town official having supervision of such property.

endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians, or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the President of the Council members shall
have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to
a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of
backfilling. It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary
permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and
disposal sites.
   (B)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the Street
Superintendent. Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or
to abate the dirty or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the
President of the Council members to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic
lanes.

of all rubbish, excess earth, rock, and other debris resulting from such work.
All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be
accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the President of the Council members. From time to time, as may
be ordered by the President of the Town Council, and in any event immediately
after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at his, her, or its own
expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind
resulting from said work.  Upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having
been notified to do so by the President of the Town Council, the town may enter
upon the premises of the permittee, and undertake such clean up, upon which the
cost of such clean up shall be  charged to the permittee, and the permittee
shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided
hereunder.
