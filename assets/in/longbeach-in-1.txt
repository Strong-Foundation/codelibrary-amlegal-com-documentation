(IC 1-1-4-1)
   (A)   General. Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary,
and usual sense. But technical words and phrases having a peculiar and

      (1)   In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this code

designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of
the period so computed is to be included unless it is:
         (a)   A Saturday;
         (b)   A Sunday;
         (c)   A legal holiday as defined by state statute; or

regular business hours.
      (2)   In any event, the period runs until the end of the next day that is
not a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal holiday, or a day on which the office is
closed. When the period of time allowed is less than seven days, intermediate
Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days on which the office is closed

month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
      (5)   In all cases where the law requires any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean the time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.
   (D)   Act by assistants. When a statute requires an act to be done which, by

contains any express provision excluding such construction, or when the subject
matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
§ 10.06 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed.
   (B)   When a provision of the code is repealed or amended, the repeal or
amendment does not affect pending actions, prosecutions or proceedings, civil
or criminal. When the repeal or amendment relates to the remedy, it does not
affect pending actions, prosecutions, or proceedings, unless so expressed, nor
does any repeal or amendment affect causes of the action, prosecution, or
proceeding, existing at the time of the amendment or repeal, unless otherwise
expressly provided in the amending or repealing law.

been incurred by virtue of the repealed provision;

liabilities existing or arising thereunder.

provision.

continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the repeal, provided this
does not affect the limitation of actions, prosecutions, or proceedings imposed
by any state statute.
§ 10.07 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
such reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as
subsequently amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject
matter is changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
   (B)   Whenever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, the reference shall be construed to
mean a violation of any provision of the section or sections included in the
reference.
   (C)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by the code.
§ 10.08 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, chapters, or sections of the codified
ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the subject matter taken as a whole.
§ 10.09 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this code as now or later amended or its application to
any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions that can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application.
(IC 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.10 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.11 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error be discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected, and
such word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration
shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or
extent of such error.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   This code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code

ordinances.
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.

for special pedestrian signals under IC 9-4-1-36, and the lights indicate and
apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits
either turn;
      (2)   Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall
yield right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent sidewalk at the time such signal is exhibited;
      (3)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time;
      (4)   Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection; and

turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.

signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated
and that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and

      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall
stop at clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown
except as provided in division (C)(2);
      (2)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting such a turn, vehicular

street into another one-way street with the flow of traffic; but such vehicular
traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic using the intersection; and
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal under IC
9-4-1-36, pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone shall not enter
the roadway.

displays no indication or conflicting indications, where no other control is
present, shall stop before entering the intersection; and
      (2)   After stopping, vehicular traffic may proceed with caution through
the intersection and shall yield the right-of-way to traffic within the
intersection, or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
   (E)   Nonintersection installations: the provisions of this section apply to
traffic-control signals located at a place other than an intersection except
those provisions which by their nature have no application. Any stop required
under this division must be made at the signal except when the signal is
supplemented by a sign or pavement marking indicating where the stop must be
made.

which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the
movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with
the effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or
signal. No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority
permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting any
public department or public utility of the city in any emergency or temporarily
from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign whose placing has been
approved by the chief police officer.
   (B)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to be a

   No provision of this traffic code for which signs are required shall be
enforceable against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation the sign herein required is not in proper position and sufficiently
legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. However, when any
particular section of this traffic code does not state that signs are required,
such section shall be effective without signs being placed to give notice
thereof.
§ 70.21 TEMPORARY CONTROL OF DEVICES.
   In any emergency any police officer may at his discretion disregard traffic-
control lights or signals or established regulations in order to facilitate the
movement of traffic.

as provide a clear space of at least 16 feet above street surface. All dead,
diseased, invasive, or dangerous town trees, or broken or decayed limbs on or
over town property, which constitute a menace to the safety of the public,
shall be removed. Any such pruning or clearing shall only occur after the town
has provided notice by certified mailing to adjacent property owners at least
14 days prior to the commencement of any such work. This notification
requirement also applies to the removal or trimming referred to in §
99.10.
   (B)   The town shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private

visual obstruction. Shrubs and other landscape features may be permitted in the
clear vision triangle area if they are trimmed and maintained so that they are
not more than 24 inches above grade. Trees shall not be planted closer than 25
feet to the corner intersection of two road right-of-way lines at street
intersection; however, trees with at least eight feet of limbless trunk may be
permitted within the clear vision triangle area.
   (C)   Pruning shall be limited to the offending branches but may not be
limited to the property line when such limited pruning will endanger the health
of an entire tree. Pruning shall begin only after the homeowner has been
notified by certified mail sent to the address of record obtained from the Town
of Long Beach Water Department at least 14 days prior to the start of the
proposed work. Only one attempt will be made to notify homeowner. Tree limbs
that grow near high voltage electrical conductors shall be maintained clear of

correct the violation, fixing a reasonable time within which such correction
shall be made or accomplished and, upon compliance with such order, the Town
Council may dismiss such complaint. If the contractor does not correct such
violation within the time required by the previous order, the Town Council
shall have the power to extend such time for correction of the violation or
shall have the right to suspend such contractor registration for a
determinative period or may revoke the contractor registration without any
further right to hearing by registrant.
      (3)   After revocation of any contractor registration, such registration
shall not be renewed, and no new contractor registration shall be issued to the

one year subsequent to the date of revocation. After the expiration of the one-

documentation showing that all violations, acts, or omissions for which the
contractor registration was revoked have been corrected and that compliance
with all conditions imposed by the decision of the revocation has been met. The
town shall maintain a list of all revocations and suspensions of a contractor
registration and which shall be available for public access for a period of
four years from the date of suspension or revocation.

TITLE, INTERPRETATION AND ENACTMENT
§ 154.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the Zoning Code of
the Town of Long Beach, LaPorte County, Indiana.
(Ord. 0203, passed 6-10-02)
§ 154.002 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflicts with public and private provisions:
      (1)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, those provisions which are more restrictive or impose higher
standards shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easements, covenants, or other
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall
govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Advisory Plan Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals in enforcing these
regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with these
regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be
operative and supplemental to these regulations and determinations made
thereunder. Private provisions can only be enforced privately unless a public
agency such as the Town of Long Beach has been made a party to such agreement.
      (3)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgement shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgement shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The town hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of the these regulations even without
any such part, provision or application.

rights obtained by any person, firm, limited liability company, or corporation,
by lawful action of the town except as shall be expressly provided for in this
chapter.
(Ord. 0203, passed 6-10-02)
§ 154.004 EXCLUSION.
   Nothing in this chapter or in any rules, regulations or orders issued

common nuisance, and the owner or possessor of the structure, land, or premises
upon which the use is maintained shall be liable for such nuisance.
   (E)   Daily violation and fines. Any person whether owner or possessor, who
shall violate, or who permits or allows a violation, of any of the provisions

of the town.

sewer services where not otherwise currently provided, substantially in excess
of such requirements and costs if the district were developed solely for
single-family dwelling of compatible size of dwellings within the immediate

   (B)   Intended purpose. This section provides regulations for solar energy
systems as an alternative energy-providing source. These regulations shall
guide the safe and effective use and installation of solar energy systems
throughout the town while taking care to avoid adverse effects as to cost or
efficacy of the system in accordance with IC 36-7-2-8.
(Ord. 2021-15, passed 11-8-21)
§ 154.081 SYSTEMS PERMITTED AND APPLICABILITY OF OTHER TOWN ORDINANCES.
   All buildings shall be allowed to incorporate solar energy systems in their
design, provided they are in compliance with the applicable requirements set
forth in this chapter and all building and zoning ordinances of the town,
including all lot and setback requirements. A building permit shall be required
for all such systems.
(Ord. 2021-15, passed 11-8-21)
§ 154.082 RESTRICTIONS ON SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   In addition to the requirements set forth in §
154.081, solar energy systems shall comply with the following requirements:
   (A)   (1)   Solar energy systems may be roof-mounted and or ground-mounted
in the rear yard only.
      (2)   Height. The solar energy systems shall generally comply with
general height restrictions set forth in the Zoning Code. However, ground-
mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed 15 feet in height when oriented
at maximum tilt.
   (B)   Setback. In addition to meeting the accessory structure setback
requirements set forth in the town code, solar energy systems shall comply with
the following standards:
      (1)   Roof-mounted solar energy systems. The collector surface and
mounting devices for roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not extend beyond
the exterior perimeter of the building on which the system is mounted or built,
unless the collector and mounting system has been explicitly engineered to
safely extend beyond the edge, and setback standards are not violated. Exterior
piping for solar hot water systems shall be allowed to extend beyond the
perimeter of the building on a side yard exposure. Solar collectors mounted on
the sides of buildings and serving as awnings are considered to be building-
integrated systems and are regulated as awnings.
      (2)   Ground-mounted solar energy systems. Ground-mounted solar energy
systems may not extend into the side-yard or rear setback when oriented at
minimum design tilt except as permitted under the Zoning Code.
   (C)   Visibility. In general, solar energy systems shall be designed to
minimize visual impacts from the public right-of-way and subject to the
following considerations:
      (1)   Building integrated systems. Building integrated solar energy
systems shall be allowed regardless of whether the system is visible from the
public right-of-way, provided the building component in which the system is
integrated meets all other provisions of the Zoning Code.
      (2)   Aesthetic restrictions. Roof-mounted solar energy systems shall be
permitted or ground-mounted solar energy systems shall not be restricted for
aesthetic reasons if the system is not visible from the closest edge of any
public right-of-way other than an alley or if the system meets the following
criteria:
         (a)   Roof-mounted systems on pitched roofs that are visible from the
nearest edge of the front right-of-way shall have the same finished pitch as
the roof and be no more than ten inches above the roof.
         (b)   Roof-mounted systems on flat roofs that are visible from the
nearest edge of the front right-of-way shall not be more than five feet above
the finished roof and are exempt from any rooftop equipment or mechanical
system screening.
      (3)   Reflectors. All solar energy systems using a reflector to enhance
solar production shall minimize glare from the reflector affecting adjacent or
nearby properties.
   (D)   Screening.
      (1)   Visual impact. If a solar energy system can be viewed from a public
right-of-way or adjacent property, the town, by and through its Building
Commission, as appropriate, may require screening if it first determines there
is a clear community interest in maintaining a view shed. Screening
requirements imposed by the town should be reasonable, practical and should not
unreasonably impair the efficiency of the solar energy system.
      (2)   Large solar structures. Any ground-mounted solar energy system
exceeding 400 square feet shall be screened from existing residential dwellings
and public rights-of-way, and a landscape plan shall be submitted with the
building permit application that identifies the type and extent of the proposed
screening.
   (E)   Compliance and components.
      (1)   Approved solar components. Electric solar energy system components
must have an Underwriters Laboratory (UL) or equivalent listing and solar hot
water systems must have a Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC) or
equivalent rating.
      (2)   Compliance with Building Code. All solar energy systems shall
comply with the town building code, consistent with the State of Indiana
Building Code, and solar thermal systems shall comply with HVAC-related
requirements of the Energy Code.
      (3)   Compliance with State Electric Code. All photovoltaic solar energy
systems shall comply with the Indiana State Electric Code.
      (4)   Compliance with State Plumbing Code. All solar thermal systems
shall comply with the applicable Indiana State Plumbing Codes requirements.
      (5)   Utility notification. No solar energy generating system connected
or capable of being connected to a local utility, also known as grid tied,
shall be installed until evidence has been provided to the town that the local
utility has been informed of the property owner's intention to install an
interconnected customer-owned generator and any utility required
interconnection agreement between the utility and the property owner has been
executed. Stand alone or off grid solar systems are exempt from these
requirements.

   (A)   Earth changes and alteration of topography. It is a goal of the town
to retain the current dune topography to the maximum extent possible and
require developers of zoning lots to plan the development of the zoning lot so
as to minimize changes in topography. Therefore, a building permit is required
to modify the topography of any zoning lot from its current condition. All
applicants for a building permit shall be required to submit a topographic
survey, signed by an Indiana Registered Surveyor, showing the existing
topography of the zoning lot and proposed final topography of the zoning lot.
In granting a permit, the Building Commission shall consider and make the
following determinations:
      (1)   The planning and design of the of all structures, revetments,
retaining walls and the like are designed to minimize the amount of topographic
change of the zoning lot necessary for the construction of the proposed
buildings and structures;

§ 154.118 OUTDOOR SIGNS.
   (A)   Intent. This chapter is intended to regulate signs and to minimize
outdoor advertising in order to protect public safety, health and welfare;
minimize abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist
distraction, and loss of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve
property values; and enhance the aesthetic appearance and quality of life of
the community. The requirements contained herein are intended to be content
neutral. The following objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum
amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction,
illumination, and other aspects of signs in the town in order to:
      (1)   Protect the public right to receive messages, including religious,
political, economic, social, philosophical and other types of information
protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution;
      (2)   Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to
motorists and non-motorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs
directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform
traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents;
      (3)   Maintain and improve the image of the community by encouraging
signs of consistent size which are compatible with and complementary to related
buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings;
      (4)   Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs, to meet
the purpose of these requirements and serve the public interest, should be for
identification of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising
special events, brand names or off-premise activities, as these can be
advertised more appropriately by other methods;
      (5)   Eliminate potential conflicts between business signs and traffic
control signs, thereby minimizing the potential for confusion and hazardous
consequences;
      (6)   Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without
undue difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of
signs;
      (7)   Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of
adjacent uses;
      (8)   Prevent off-premise signs from conflicting with other land uses;
      (9)   Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to
structural deficiencies or disrepair; and
      (10)   Regulate portable commercial signs in recognition of the negative
impact on traffic safety and aesthetics.
   (B)   Definitions. The definitions set forth in this division shall be

Long Beach town ordinances and the property owner has provided all applicable
federal, state, county, and town permit(s) and approval(s), shall a building
permit for the construction of a protection structure be issued.

106.6 foot line, the Army Corps of Engineers’ jurisdictional line, and the
NOHWM. The NOHWM location is to be certified on the site plan by the property
owner’s surveyor and must conform with the determination by applicant’s town
approved delineation consultant. However, if the Building Commission in its
sole discretion finds that the Army Corps of Engineers’ elevation is outdated
because of lake level changes or expiration of the elevation since the last
formal determination, the applicant shall be required to obtain an updated
delineation from the Army Corps of Engineers if required in conformance with
its standard and this shall be at the property owner’s expense in accordance
with this section;
         (c)   Soil boring are preferred and recommended but not required. If
obtained, the soil borings report performed by a state licensed soil engineer
and plans certified by a structural engineer shall be submitted;

erosion and other adverse impacts on other properties and the public trust and
lands while simultaneously protecting the subject property.
      (2)   The proposed protection structure involves the minimum shore
hardening necessary to provide for the level of protection necessary to achieve
the purpose and intent of this subchapter.
      (3)   Access to the lakeshore and public trust lands at town beach stops
is not adversely affected.
      (4)   The applicant’s protection structure will not encroach on any
neighboring private or public property or any conservation, drainage, utility,
or any other easements of record.
      (5)   The protection structure is the alternative or option least likely
to cause: a measurable increase in erosion, including lakebed erosion at the
development site or at other locations along the shoreline of the Coastal Zone
and/or adverse effects upon natural protective features, existing erosion
protection structures, and natural resources, such as significant wildlife
habitats, including the transport of sand known as littoral flow.
      (6)   All installations of a seawall are to comply with the Steep Slope
Resolution #301 of the Town of Long Beach. The slope shall be measured at its
steepest point and is not measured as the average slope of the lot.

government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Long Beach does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2022-12, passed 9-26-22)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of the Town of Long Beach are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2022-12, passed 9-26-22)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health.
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains.
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area.
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas.
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain.
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible.
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2022-12, passed 9-26-22)
§ 155.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2022-12, passed 9-26-22)

of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in
the SFHA. For sites within a SFHA designated as “Zone AO,” the BFE is
equivalent to the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map,
measured from the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth is specified, two
feet is used as the minimum depth. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA.  Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town of
Long Beach Town Council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by:
         (a)   An approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
Interior, or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved
programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LATTICE WORK. See BREAKAWAY WALL.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEM A maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F).  A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).  An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes, the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
natural grade.

which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.

structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.

equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are

in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
155.16 of this chapter. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term “Base
Flood”, “One-Percent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Food-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Solid waste also includes sewage sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition
wastes, mining wastes, and liquids and gases stored in containers.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter consistent
with the variance conditions herein.

the community.
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and,
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the BZA can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted at
the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
155.05.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
155.55(A), (C)(1), or (D) of this chapter may be granted.
   (G)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §

regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §§
155.55 through
155.60 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an “historic
structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (L)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of

variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 2022-12, passed 9-26-22)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 155.55 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
155.16, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions to the
requirements of the Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1 and 312IAC 10) may apply to
qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential structures,
rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings,
outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
155.16, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (IC 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this section.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to quality for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of §
155.39(A). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority granted
to the Town of Long Beach, Indiana (the “town”) under “Home Rule” and further
is required by Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Stormwater program (40 CFR Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999)
authorized by the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management’s (IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management’s Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP). Based
on this authority and these requirements, this chapter regulates:
      (1)   Discharges of prohibited non-storm water flows into the storm drain
system.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the town.
      (3)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
      (6)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (7)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
      (8)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
      (9)   The design, construction, and maintenance of new dams.
      (10)   The development downstream of existing dams.
      (11)   Development within floodplains, floodways, fluvial erosion hazard
corridors, and bluff zones.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Town Stormwater
Management Ordinance. Once adopted, this chapter will supersede any conflicting
ordinances previously adopted by the town.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the town. No building permit shall be issued and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
156.006, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the town. With the exception of the requirements of
§§
156.040 through
156.046 and §
156.093, single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted subdivisions,
and land-disturbing activities affecting less than 10,000 square feet of area
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also exempt from this
chapter shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, compliance with all applicable
ordinances of town as well as with applicable federal, State of Indiana, and
other local statues and regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise
stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most
recent edition available. Town capital improvement projects shall be exempt
from obtaining a permit, but are expected to meet all applicable technical
requirements of this chapter and the Town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. If the project site is located within a LaPorte County Regulated Drain
Watershed, the applicant will need to check with the LaPorte County Surveyor’s
Office to learn if additional Surveyor’s Office requirements specific to that
regulated drain would apply to the site. In case there are conflicts between
the requirements contained in this chapter and applicable requirements
contained in other regulatory documents referenced above, the most restrictive
shall prevail.
   (C)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the town within a two-year period prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in
excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance.
Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in §§
156.040 through
156.046.
   (D)   The town has the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive
any and all the requirements of this chapter and its associated technical
standards document. A presubmittal meeting with the town may be requested by
the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions of the chapter
and its associated technical standards document with regards to unique or
unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any initial determination
of such applicability shall not be binding on future determinations of the town
that may be based on the review of more detailed information and plans.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.003 FINDINGS.
   The town finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the town
or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town’s water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the town. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

which is inundated by the regulatory flood.
   FLUVIAL EROSION HAZARD (FEH) CORRIDOR. Fluvial erosion hazard corridors
represent the areas along the streams (including the channel and immediate
overbanks areas) that are believed to be subject to stream movement or
streambank erosion. These corridors have been delineated for most actively
migrating and relatively stationary streams in Indiana through an Indiana
Silver Jackets initiative.
   FOOTING DRAIN. A drain pipe installed around the exterior of a basement wall
foundation to relieve water pressure caused by high groundwater elevation.

defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The town has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town’s control, in
an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the
system. This inspection will include a screening of discharges from outfalls
connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being
conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could also include spot testing of
waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction
of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as
dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the town’s properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger’s property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §§
156.110 through
156.113.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the town, the town has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 156.040 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the town. The town, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may
waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and
parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention
requirements are provided under § 156.041 below.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.041 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined in §
156.006) located within the town. Release rate requirements, downstream
restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property impact
considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on pluvial erosion hazard
corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the Town
Stormwater Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the town to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) adopted by
the town substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by town include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.042 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all

conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by town. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the Town Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed relative to the
conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within
the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner
association.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 156.060 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The town will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP),
which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land disturbing activities
resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total land area
is subject to the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both new
development and re-development. This subchapter also applies to disturbances of
land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land
area. Section
156.077 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM’s CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a storm water permit from the town, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§
156.090 through
156.099, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For an individual lot where land disturbance is 10,000 square
feet or more but less than one acre, an individual lot plot plan permit
application is required prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §§
156.090 through
156.099.
   (D)   An individual lot located within a larger permitted project site is
considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot
operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit
approved for the larger project site. The stormwater permit application for the
larger project site must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures
for individual lots. In addition, the builders of these individual lots are
required to submit individual lot plot plan permit application along with a
SWPPP for that individual lot prior to receiving a building permit. Details of
the permitting process for individual lots and parcels are contained in §§
156.090 through
156.099 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
156.090 through
156.099. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the town upon completion
of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a termination
inspection to be performed by the town. However, all persons engaging in
construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
subchapter and this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.061 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the town, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a
narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated. For land
disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less than one acre,
appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the
Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual must be designed and shown on the
plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the Town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.062 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and
the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The methods and
procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above
stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM’s CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.063 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the town and commencement of construction activities,
the town has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater
pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms
and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the town, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the Town Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this subchapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (D)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of onsite individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the Town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 156.075 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
156.075 through
156.079, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the town as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the town that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of 10,000
square feet or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this
subchapter. This includes both new development and re-development, and
disturbances of land less than 10,000 square feet of total land area that are
part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land area. In
addition, regardless of the amount of disturbance, the town reserves the right
to require pre-treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance
with provisions contained in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   (1)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the
following activities:
      (2)   Construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale; or individual building lots within a
larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with this subchapter. It will
be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure proper construction
and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the protection of post-
stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance with this chapter and
with the approved stormwater management permit, and to notify the town upon
completion of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a
termination inspection to be performed by the town. However, all eventual
property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability
requirements must comply with the requirements of this subchapter and this
chapter.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.076 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
town, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), to treat the water quality
volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq) stormwater runoff will be filtered
and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the town,
is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of the town, measures must be taken to minimize the
impact of such development or re-development on streambank erosion. Through the
use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and
slowly release the channel protection volume (CPv), the volume and rate of
runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize
increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the town a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMPs specified in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and maintenance manual
for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the
Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the long-term
maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the deed for
the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP(s) must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other
than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the
burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the Town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMPs are provided in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under “Hot Spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.077 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines discussed
in §
156.062.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Town Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in the
referenced Standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet or
exceed the requirements of IDEM’s MS4 GP.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.078 EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention
basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-
of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of
monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, adequate easement
width, as detailed in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, beyond
the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as a
20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be
provided.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.079 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater pollution prevention
plan, the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition,
in accordance with the operation and maintenance procedures and schedules
listed in the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, in addition to the
designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities and shall
not be subsequently altered, revised, or replaced except as approved by the

§ 156.091 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This subchapter applies to all development, or re-development of land,
that results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance less than one acre shall refer to §§
156.075 through
156.079, §§
156.090 through
156.099, and §
156.093 below for plan review requirements and procedures. Figure 1 is a
flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval/project termination
compliance process for land disturbance of one acre or more and can be found in
division (E) below.
   (B)   General procedures.
      (1)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the Building Commission. The application will include a
completed application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater
drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any
other necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
156.092 below. Nine paper copies and one electronic copy of each application
must be submitted to the Building Commission. The Building Commission may, at
its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to other entities
deemed appropriate by the Building Commission. Additionally, a digital copy of
the construction plans is required in a format accepted by the Building
Commission.
      (2)   After the Building Commission’s receipt of the application, the
applicant will be notified as to whether their application was complete or
insufficient. The applicant will be asked for additional information if the
application is insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be
reviewed in detail by the Building Commission and/or its plan review consultant
(s)/designee(s). Once all comments have been received and review completed, the
Building Commission will either approve the project, request modifications or
deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with or accept the review
findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals will place
the project on the agenda of its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the
agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or published and further
provided the applicant timely complies with all BZA requirements. If time for
notification does not allow, the project shall be placed on the following
regularly scheduled meeting of the Building Commission. If the project must go
through a scheduled meeting, the town will furnish the applicant a complete
list of comments and objections to the plans and accompanying data prior to the
scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the town will either issue a
permit, request modifications to the construction plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the town shall be in the form of an
email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI
submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the town and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the project
owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the town. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the town, requesting a termination inspection.
The town, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
town’s stormwater chapter and its technical standards and that the terms and
conditions of the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the
termination inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a
copy to IDEM along with the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the town
under this scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If
construction is not completed within five years, an updated permit application
must be submitted to the town and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at
least 90 days prior to expiration.
   (C)   SWPPP review time limits. Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated
entity or other review authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary
determination as to whether the construction plan associated with SWPPP is
substantially complete before the end of the tenth working day (for sites with
less than five acres of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is
submitted to the review authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with
five acres or larger of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is
submitted to the review authority. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP
review, the following scenarios may play out:
      (1)   No SWPPP review notification received: If the review authority does
not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or this chapter and the Town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted
to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the land disturbing
activities of the construction project.
      (2)   SWPPP not substantially complete: If the review authority notifies
the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially complete, the
project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM until the
review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination concerning the
construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the Town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
      (3)   Unfavorable SWPPP: If the review authority notifies the applicant
that the construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a conclusive
unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan under IDEM rule/
permit, or this chapter and the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, the
project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM.
      (4)   Preliminary SWPPP review: If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project. The plan
review authority reserves the right to perform a comprehensive review at a
later date, and revisions may be required at that time.
      (5)   Conditional SWPPP review: If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
conditional review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project provided
that the requirements included in the conditional review are fulfilled.
      (6)   Favorable SWPPP review: If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the Town Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project,
including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
   (D)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of the
overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or non-
official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
storm water permit application.
   (E)   Permit approval and project termination sign-off process.

(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.096 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained
privately. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the town
shall require the applicant to provide assurance in form of an irrevocable
letter of credit or a bond when the stormwater management plan has been
accepted and before construction begins.
   (A)   Said assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the storm
water drainage plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the stormwater
quality management plan, and any permit conditions. The assurance shall be for
an amount equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater management
measures for the entire project.
   (B)   The above-mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by
a registered engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the
installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures
and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage
infrastructure, detention/retention facilities, and stormwater quality BMPs, as
regulated under this chapter, until the construction is completed, the site is
stabilized, and as-built plans are accepted by the town.
   (C)   Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other performance
bonds, maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the town in accordance
with any and all other ordinances shall also apply and so be required. Local
governmental jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or
maintenance assurances.
   (D)   The intent of this assurance is not only to complete the installation
of storm drain infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate
stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained.
If adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
stormwater assurance.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.097 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the town may impose such
terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this
chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms and
conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
156.110 through
156.113.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the town may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
      (1)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with U.S. EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on
a site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
      (2)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
         (a)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the town.
            1.   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated
FEMA Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
            2.   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
town’s system.
            3.   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any storm water
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the town’s system.
            4.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
            5.   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
            6.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
            7.   Land within the Fluvial Erosion Hazard (FEH) corridor.
            8.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
         (b)   The town or Town Engineer is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining
impact drainage areas, the town may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
         (c)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the town. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
      (3)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The town is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or re-
development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the Town
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.098 CERTIFICATION OF AS-BUILT PLANS.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained
privately. After completion of construction of the project and before the
release of required performance assurances referenced in §
156.096 above, a professionally prepared and certified “as-built” set of plans
(record drawings) shall be submitted to the town for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the Engineer of Record,
i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans.
Additionally, a digital copy of the “as-built” plans (record drawings) as well
as finalized digital versions of all analyses, models, manuals, and reports
that are consistent with the as-built conditions is required in a format
acceptable to the town. These plans shall include all pertinent data relevant
to the completed storm drainage system and stormwater management facilities,
and shall include:
   (A)   Pipe size and pipe material.
   (B)   Invert elevations.
   (C)   Top rim elevations.
   (D)   Elevation of the emergency overflow (spillway) for ponds.
   (E)   Grades along the emergency flood routing path(s).
   (F)   Pipe structure lengths.
   (G)   BMP types, dimensions, and boundaries/easements.
   (H)   “As-planted” plans for BMPs, as applicable.
   (I)   Data and calculations showing detention basin storage volume.
   (J)   Data and calculations showing BMP treatment capacity.
   (K)   Certified statement on plans stating the completed storm drainage
system and stormwater management facilities substantially comply with
construction plans and the Stormwater Management Permit as approved by the
town. (See certificate in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual).
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.099 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a two-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the town in an amount not
to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside
the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the town in order
to assure that such stormwater system installation was done according to
standards of good workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and
installation were of good quality and construction, and that such project was
done in accordance with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-
site drainage problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such
project, will be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the town
to have been caused by the development of such project. The bond or other
acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period of two years after the
date of the release of required performance assurances referenced in §
156.096 above. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the Town
Council of the town.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the stormwater management system and submittal of
as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled by the town and paid for by the developer.
Notices shall be provided to the town within 72 hours following the completion
of installation and again at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the
maintenance bond so that the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports
summarizing the results of the noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and
accepted by the town before the plat is recommended for recording and again
before the maintenance bond shall be recommended to be released.
   (C)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
maintenance agreement, O&M Maintenance Manual, and maintenance escrow accounts
to subsequent owners prior to release of the maintenance bond is discussed in
§§
156.075 through
156.079.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 156.110 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   To secure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, violations
thereof shall be subject to the enforcement provisions set forth under §
156.111 following. Additionally, compliance with the requirements set forth in
the local zoning ordinances is also necessary. Compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the town as well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and
regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other
specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition
available.
   (A)   Definitions.
      (1)   VIOLATION. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this
subchapter. Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and
may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to and
separate from the imposition of any of the enforcement actions described below.
      (2)   COMPLIANCE. The act of correcting a violation or violations within
the time frame specified by the town.
      (3)   OFFENSE. Both a violation and a failure of compliance on a
particular project constitute an “offense.” If there are multiple violations or
multiple failures of compliance on the same project, each shall be considered a
separate offense as further stated in §
156.111(C).
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
town to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.111 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the town determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the town may impose upon a violator,
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, and the like.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a
civil infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues
without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the town may be deemed a
separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a
fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this section are
cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An admission
or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this subchapter.
      (3)   The town has established an enforcement response schedule as noted
in the table below that standardizes the approach that the town may, in its
discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to
this chapter and the associated technical standards document. When so employed,
this schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the following manner:
The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while the subsequent
offenses two through eight (as necessary) are failures of compliance.
Offense # Type of response anticipated
Offense #   Type of response anticipated
1st offense Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning and
            administrative penalty
2nd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
3rd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
4th offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
5th offense Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
6th offense Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
7th offense Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
8th offense Litigation and administrative penalty
 
      (4)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the town may,
in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties, the
town has established the following schedule of administrative penalties. Again,
the penalty for the first offense would apply to the violation itself, while
the subsequent penalties two through four (as necessary) would apply to
failures of compliance. In its discretion, the town may impose penalties up to
the amount specified in this schedule.
 
Offense #   Penalty
1st offense $250
2nd offense $500
3rd offense $1,000
4th offense $2,500
 
   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the town may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the town to proceed with the work. A stop work order will be
posted on the site by the town and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the town. The
town may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable
protective measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce
the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work.
      (2)   The town may bring an action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work
order against any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the town, if a stop
work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and sediment control
measures included in the construction plan are not adequate, the project site
owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the erosion and
sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours after
receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before the stop
work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72 hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the town.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The town may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the town may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may commence court action
against such person under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-
6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
         (c)   The town may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the town may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the town.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.112 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the town may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the town for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the town’s NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the town or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the town may commence a court action to
recover the costs assessed under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with
I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4).
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 6-10-24)
§ 156.113 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Board of Zoning
Appeals (“BZA”) the action or decision whereby any such provision was so
applied. Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis
for the appeal. The BZA shall consider the appeal and make a decision whereby
it affirms, rejects, or modifies the action being appealed. In considering any
such appeal, BZA may consider the recommendations of the town staff and the
comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering any
such appeal, the BZA may grant a variance from the terms of this chapter to
provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being appealed, but only
upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
the chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of storm water runoff.
      (3)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the BZA may appeal an
adverse decision of the Board to a court having jurisdiction in LaPorte County
within 60 days of the Boards order, all pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9(e) and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the BZA
upholding the decision of the town, then representatives of the town shall
enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property,
including the commencing of a court action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b),to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce the order of
the BZA.
