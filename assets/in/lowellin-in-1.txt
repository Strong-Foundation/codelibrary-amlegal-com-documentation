FIXED CAPITAL ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 35.25 DEFINITIONS AND PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purposes of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods and shall include the costs of acquiring land or structures,

and equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of
usefulness. These are expenditures that result in the acquisition of or
addition to the government's general fixed assets.
   FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the town's departments and utilities that are relatively
permanent and are needed for the delivery of town and/or utility services that
are not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. These fixed assets
shall be defined into classes according to the physical characteristics (e.g.
land, buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, improvements
other than buildings).
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses as they may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.
   (B)   Land. The town will capitalize all land purchases regardless of cost.
      (1)   Exceptions to land capitalization are land purchased outright as
easements or rights of way for infrastructure needs (i.e., roads and streets,
street lighting, bridges sidewalks, trails, curbs, street signs and storm water
collection). Easements required for water or sewer infrastructure may be
capitalized.
      (2)   Original cost of land will include the full value given to the
seller, in addition to those costs associated with securing and preparing the
land for final use. These fees may include legal, appraisal, negotiation, title
work and opinion, surveying, and costs required to prepare the land for its
intended use.
      (3)   A department will record donated land at fair market value on the
date of transfer plus any associated costs.
      (4)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies in addition to the above procedures.
   (C)    Machinery and equipment.

conglomeration of pieces to form a tool or purchased equipment. These items
will stand alone and not become a part of a basic structure or building.
      (2)   The, town will capitalize items with an individual value equal to
or greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one
unit with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one
unit.
      (3)   Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost directly
associated with the purchase, delivery, or set up, will be capitalized.
      (4)   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
         (a)   Total costs exceed $1,000;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
         (c)   The total costs will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
      (5)   A department will record donated machinery and equipment at fair
market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs included.
      (6)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies in addition to the above procedures.
   (D)   Buildings.
      (1)   A department will capitalize buildings at full cost with no
requirement for subcategories for tracking the cost of separate building
systems like HVAC, sprinklers, plumbing, lighting, etc. If subcategories are
beneficial for enterprise accounting this may be done. The department will
include the cost of items designed or purchased exclusively for the building.
      (2)   A department's new building will be capitalized only if it meets
the following two conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
         (b)   The useful life is greater than five years.
      (3)   A department improving or renovating an existing building will
capitalize the cost only if the result meets all of the following conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years; and
         (c)   The total costs will be greater than the current book value and
less than the fair market value.
      (4)   Capital building costs will include preparation of land for the
building, architectural and engineering fees, bond issuance fees, interest cost
(while under construction), accounting costs if material, and any other costs
directly attributable to the construction of a building.
      (5)   A department will record donated buildings at fair market value on
the date of transfer with any associated costs.
      (6)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source funding policies in addition to the above procedures.
   (E)   Improvements other than buildings.
      (1)   The definition of this category of fixed assets is improvements to
land that results in better enjoyment of that land and also has a life
expectancy greater than two years. The fixed asset in this class is also
attached or not easily removed from the existing land. Examples are walks,
parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls, pools,
outside fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems, and other similar
items.
      (2)   The town will capitalize new improvements other than buildings only
if it meets the following two conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000;
         (b)   The useful life is greater than two years.
      (3)   A department will capitalize improvements or renovations to
existing improvements other than buildings only if the result meets all of the
following conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $2,500;
         (b)   The asset's useful life is extended two or more years; and

recorded at fair market value on the date of the transfer with any associated
costs.
      (5)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will follow the
source finding policies and above procedures.
   (F)   Historical costs. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or
services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most
inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost
attribute.
   (G)   Enterprise funds. Enterprise funds are those used to account for
operations that are:
      (1)   Financed and operated in a manner similar to private business
enterprise, where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses,
including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on
a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
      (2)   Where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and
other purposes.
      (3)   The enterprise funds of the Town of Lowell, Indiana, shall include
the municipally owned water and wastewater utilities and the operation of these
utilities shall require enterprise fund accounting and reporting.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-22-01; Am. Ord. 2008-09, passed 5-12-08)
§ 35.26 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The town and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting Manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the town and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The town's municipally owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price.
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract.
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease.
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of nonmonetary assets.
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities.
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction.
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
      (8)   Acquisition by grant funds.
      (9)    Acquisition by contribution.
   (C)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
For purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities, the valuation of
assets shall be based on historical costs.
   (D)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed state form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detail record of the capital assets of the governmental
unit.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-22-01)
§ 35.27 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   (A)   The accounting controls shall be designed and implemented to provide
reasonable assurances that:
      (1)   Capital expenditures made by the town, its various departments and
utilities be in accordance with management's authorization as documented in the
minutes.
      (2)   Transactions of the utilities are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
principles.
      (3)   Adequate detail records be maintained to assure accountability for
town-owned and utility-owned assets.
      (4)   Access to assets be permitted in accordance with management's
authorization.
      (5)   The recorded accountability for assets be compared with the
existing assets at least every two years and appropriate action be taken with
respect to any differences.

all applicable apprenticeship standards and apprenticeship agreement(s) for any
apprentice(s) who will perform work on the public works project; and

the bidder, additional verification any of the information provided by the

customers.
   (B)   Post-bid submissions from subcontractors.
      (1)   Each subcontractor of any tier shall be required to adhere to the
requirements of division (A) above, but subcontractors shall submit the
required information to the successful bidder, who shall then submit said
information to the town prior to the subcontractor’s first day of work on the
public works project.
      (2)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default or breach by the successful bidder.
However, payment shall be withheld from any subcontractor who fails to timely
submit said information until such information is submitted and approved by the
town. Additionally, the town may require the successful bidder and/or relevant
subcontractor to remove a subcontractor from the project and replace it with a
responsive and responsible subcontractor.
      (3)   The disclosure of a subcontractor by a bidder or a subcontractor
shall not create any rights in the disclosed subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/
or a subcontractor may substitute another subcontractor for a disclosed
subcontractor by giving the town written notice of the name, address, and type
of work the substitute subcontractor will perform. The substitute subcontractor
is subject to all of the obligations of a subcontractor under this subchapter.
   (C)   Validity of pre- qualification classification.
      (1)   Upon designation by the town that a bidder’s or subcontractor’s
submission is complete and timely, and upon any further consideration deemed
necessary by the town, the bidder or subcontractor may be pre-qualified for
future town public works projects. Pre-qualification shall exempt the bidder or
subcontractor from the comprehensive submission requirements contained herein
for a period of 12 months. Thereafter, bidders or subcontractors who are pre-
qualified must submit a complete application for continuation of pre-qualified
standing, on a form provided by the town, (i.e. a “short form”) by December 31
for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any pre-qualified bidder or
subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for continuation of
pre-qualified standing shall result in automatic removal of the designation
effective January 1 of the upcoming year. However, the removed bidder or
subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on or perform work on town public
works projects.
      (2)   Any material changes to a contractor’s status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within ten days of its occurrence to the town. The pre-
qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the town and the
town specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a
stated written reason(s).
      (3)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be
forwarded to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any
contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status may request
reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the
town within five business days of receipt of notice of denial.
   (D)   Incomplete submissions by bidders. It is the sole responsibility of
the bidder to comply with all submission requirements herein no later than the
public bid opening. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by
the town shall result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.
   (E)   Responsive and responsible bidder determination. After its review of
complete and timely submissions, taking into account all information in the
submission requirements, the town shall in its sole discretion, determine
whether a bidder or subcontractor is responsive and responsible. The town
reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the bidder or
subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by the town through its
own independent verification of the information provided.
   (F)   Certified payroll.
      (1)   For projects in which the cost is at least $150,000, the successful
bidder and all subcontractors working on a public works project shall submit a
certified payroll report utilizing federal form WH-347 or its successor form,
which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the town within ten
calendar days after the end of each week in which the successful bidder or
subcontractor performed on the public works project. Certified payroll reports
shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g.,
journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician. In the event any successful
bidder or subcontractor uses independent contractors to perform work on the
project, such individual must be identified on the federal form WH-347 or
successor form with the same information as is required for employees.
      (2)   The town may withhold payment due for work performed by a
successful bidder or subcontractor for failure to timely submit their
respective certified payroll reports until such time as the reports are
submitted. The town shall not withhold payment to a successful bidder or
subcontractor for failure of the successful bidder or one or more other
subcontractors to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
   (G)   Public records. All information submitted by a bidder or a
subcontractor pursuant to this subchapter, including certified payrolls, are
public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public
Records law (IC 5-14-3).
   (H)   Penalties for false, deceptive, or fraudulent statements/information.
Any bidder or subcontractor that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be
made, a false, deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false,
deceptive or fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to
the town shall be disqualified from bidding or working on all town projects for
a period of three years.

complying customer and retain a copy of the notice delivered.
      (3)   Upon the second or any ensuing occurrence by the same customer, the
contract hauler shall leave any improperly prepared or non-recyclable material
at the curbside, collect all properly prepared recyclable material and complete
a "notice of non-compliance" and deliver it to the customer after recording the

DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, AND MONITORING REGULATIONS
§ 51.035 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   The Wastewater Discharge Ordinance sets uniform requirements for discharges
into the wastewater collection and treatment system and enables the town to
comply with the administrative provisions of the Clean Water Grant Regulations,
the water quality requirements set by the Regional Water Quality Control Board
and the applicable effluent limitations, national standards of performance,
toxic and pretreatment effluent standards, and any other discharge criteria
which are required or authorized by state or federal law, and to derive the
maximum public benefit by regulating the quality and quantity of wastewater
discharged into those systems. This subchapter provides for the setting of user
charges and fees for the equitable distribution of costs to all users, and the
issuance of permits to certain users. Revenue derived from the application of
this chapter shall be used to defray the town's cost of operating and
maintaining an adequate wastewater collector and treatment system and to
provide sufficient funds for capital outlay, bond service cost, capital
improvement, and depreciation.
('80 Code, § 13.36.010) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76)
§ 51.036 AUTHORITY OF TOWN TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN DISCHARGES.
   The town is authorized, by and through its Town Council, to prohibit dumping
of wastes into the town sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed
harmful to the operation of sewage works of the town, or to require methods
effecting pretreatment of said wastes to reduce the characteristics of the
wastes satisfactory to the town, or to pay the appropriate surcharge, under
other provisions of this chapter, if such wastes are accepted by the utility.

§ 51.038 INTERCEPTORS AND SEPARATORS.
   (A)   Interceptors required. Interceptors for oil, grease, sand and other
substances harmful or hazardous to the sanitary sewer system shall be installed
by the user at the user's sole expense when in the opinion of the Inspector or
designated representative of the town shall deem them necessary for the proper
handling of liquid waste containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand and/or other harmful ingredients.
   (B)   Interceptors not required.  A grease interceptor shall not be required
for individual dwelling units or any private living quarters.
   (C)   Separators required. At repair garages, gasoline stations with grease
racks, grease pits or work racks and at factories where oily and flammable
liquid waste are produced, separators shall be installed into which all oil
bearing, grease bearing or flammable waste shall be discharged before emptying
into the sanitary sewer system or other point of disposal.
   (D)   Size, type and location to be approved. The size, type and location of
each interceptor and of each separator shall be approved and waste other than
those requiring treatment and/or separation shall not be discharged in any
interceptor or separator. All interceptors shall be of the type and capacity
approved by the Inspector or designated town official and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil
interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of
substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily removable covers
which when bolted in place shall be gas-tight and watertight. When installed,
all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained at the user's expense
in a continuous, efficient operation at all times.
   (E)   Maintenance. All interceptors and/or separators shall be routinely
inspected and maintained at intervals of not more than six months. A written
maintenance report certifying that appropriate maintenance has been performed

51.999
§ 51.039 LIMITATIONS ON POINT OF DISCHARGE; PERMIT REQUIRED.
    No person shall discharge any substances directly into a manhole or other
opening in a community sewer other than through an approved building sewer,
unless upon written application by the user and payment of the applicable user
charges and fee, the town issues a permit for such direct discharges.
('80 Code, § 13.36.021) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76) Penalty, see §
51.999
§ 51.040 DISCHARGE OF HOLDING TANK WASTE; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A user proposing to discharge holding tank wastes into a community sewer
must secure a permit. Unless allowed by the town under the terms and conditions
of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for each separate discharge.
This permit will state the specific location of discharge, the time of day the
discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge and the wastewater
constituents and characteristics. If a permit is granted for discharge of such
waste into a community sewer, the user shall pay the applicable user charges
and fees and shall meet such other conditions as required by the town.
('80 Code, § 13.36.022) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76)
§ 51.041 ADDITIONAL EFFLUENT LIMITATION; FEDERAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   (1)   Effluent limitation promulgated by the Federal Act shall apply
in any instance where they are more stringent than those in this chapter. Under
section 307(b) of the Act, Federal Pretreatment Standards are designed to
achieve two purposes:
         (a)   To protect the operation of publicly-owned treatment works; and
         (b)   To prevent the discharge of pollutants which pass through such
works inadequately treated.
      (2)   Users in Industrial Categories subject to effluent guidelines
issued under Section 304(b) of the Act, which are discharging incompatible
pollutants to publicly-owned treatment works, are required to adopt best
practicable control technology currently available, as defined by the
Administrator pursuant to section 304(b) of the Act. Where the town treatment
works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants other
than the four pollutants listed in the definition for compatible pollutants in
§
51.001, suspended solids, pH, and fecal coliform bacteria, it is not
appropriate to require the industrial user to achieve best practicable control
technology currently available, since this would lead to an uneconomical
duplication of treatment facilities. While the “substantial removal” is not
subject to precise definition, it generally contemplates removals in the order
of 80% or greater. Minor incidental removals in the order of 10% to 30% are not
considered “substantial.” For some industrial categories it may be necessary to
define pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of the
discharge into publicly owned treatment works. However, any adjustments
required for particular industrial categories should be considered in
connection with the town's requirements rather than in the national
pretreatment standard. Limitations on wastewater strength in §
51.042 may be supplemented with more stringent limitations pursuant to §
51.046(D).
   (B)   If the town determines that the limitations in §§
51.036 through
51.038 may not be sufficient to enable the town's treatment works to comply
with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the Town's
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
('80 Code, § 13.36.026)
§ 51.042 METERED WATER SUPPLY.
   User charges and fees shall be applied against the total amount of water
used from all sources unless, in the opinion of the town, significant portions
of water received are not discharged to a community sewer. The total amount of
water used from public and private sources will be determined by means of
public meters or private meters, installed and maintained at the expense of the
user and approved by the town.
('80 Code, § 13.36.030) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76) Penalty, see §
51.999
§ 51.043 METERED WASTEWATER VOLUME; METERED DIVERSIONS.
   For users where, in the opinion of the town, a significant portion of the
water received from any metered source do not flow into the community sewer
because of the principal activity of the user of removal by other means, the
user charges and fees will be applied against the volume of water discharged
from such premises into the community sewer. Written notification and proof of
the diversion of water must be provided by the user if the user is to avoid the
application of the user charges and fees against the total amount of water used
from all sources. The user may install a meter of a type and at a location
approved by the town and at the user's expense. Such meters may measure either
the amount of sewage discharged or the amount of water diverted. Such meters
shall be tested for accuracy at the expense of the user when deemed necessary
by the Manager.
('80 Code, § 13.36.031) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76)
§ 51.044 ESTIMATED WASTEWATER VOLUME.
   (A)   Users without source meters. For users where in the opinion of the
town, it is unnecessary or impractical to install meters, the quantity of
wastewater may be based upon an estimate prepared by the town. This estimate
shall be based upon a rational determination of the wastewater discharged and
may consider such factors as the number of fixtures, seating capacity,
population equivalent, annual production of goods and services or such other
determinants of water use necessary to estimate the wastewater volume
discharged.
   (B)   Users with source meters. For users who, in the opinion of the town
divert a significant portion of their flow from a community sewer, the user
charges may be based upon an estimate of the volume prepared by the user,
provided the user obtains a Wastewater Discharge Permit and pays the applicable
user charges and fees. The estimate must include the method and calculations
used to determine the wastewater volume and may consider such factors as the
number of fixtures, seating capacity, population equivalents, annual production
of goods and services, or such other determinations of water user necessary to
estimate the wastewater volume discharged.
('80 Code, § 13.36.032) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76)
§ 51.045 DISCHARGE REPORTS.
   The town may require that any person discharging or proposing to discharge
wastewater into a community sewer file a periodic discharge report. The
discharge report may include, but not be limited to, nature of process, volume,
rates of flow, mass omission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
number and classification of employees, or other information which relates to
the generation of waste including wastewater constituents and characteristics
in the wastewater discharge. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid of gaseous materials stored on site even
though they may not normally be discharged. In addition to discharge reports,
the town may require information in the form of Wastewater Discharge Permit
application and self-monitoring reports.
('80 Code, § 13.36.040) (Ord. 1976-22, passed - -76)
§ 51.046 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (A)   Mandatory permits. All major contributing industries proposing to
connect or to discharge into a community sewer must obtain a Wastewater
Discharge Permit before connecting to or discharging into a community sewer.
All existing major contributing industries connected to or discharging into a
community sewer must obtain a Wastewater Discharge Permit within 90 days after
the effective date of the chapter. For purposes of this chapter a MAJOR

more per average work day, or has a flow greater than 5% of the flow in the
town's wastewater treatment system, or has in his wastes toxic pollutants in
toxic amounts as defined in standards issued under section 307(a) of the
Federal Act, or is found by the Manager to have significant impact, either
singly or in combination with other contributing industries, on the treatment
or collection system.
   (B)   Permit application.
      (1)   Users seeking a Wastewater Discharge Permit shall complete and file
with the Manager, an application in the form prescribed by the Manager, and

furnished, the Manager may issue a Wastewater Discharge Permit subject to terms
and conditions provided herein.
   (c)   Permit conditions. Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter and all other regulations, user
charges and fees established by the own. The conditions of Wastewater Discharge
Permits shall be uniformly enforced by the Manager in accordance with the
chapter, and applicable state and federal regulations. Permits may contain the

§ 51.047 MONITORING FACILITIES; MEASUREMENTS, TESTS, AND ANALYSES.
   (A)   The town may require the user to construct at his own expense,
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of
the building sewer or internal drainage systems and may also require sampling
or metering equipment to be provided, installed, and operated at the user's
expense. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (B)   If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be
accommodations to allow access for town personnel, such as a gate secured with
a town lock. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to
allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The manhole,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town's
requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and

method as may be deemed practical in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. Any and all
commercial and industrial installations shall be so controlled and/or treated
as to the sewage strength that their effluent discharged to the town's sewer
system shall have a biochemical oxygen demand not to exceed 250 parts per
million and suspended solids not to exceed 250 parts per million at any time.
In case the town permits any user to discharge industrial waste into the town's
sewer system in excess of the foregoing strength, additional rates shall be
imposed as follows:
      (1)   For five-day BOD in excess of two and one-tenth pounds for each
1,000 gallons of sewage and wastes, an additional charge of $0.07 shall be made

least 100% greater than the average of the three month block during the
previous year, taking the previous two months and the present month as the
reference for the average.
      (2)   The qualified billing, (water and/or sewer) shall be adjusted to
the average consumption of a three month block during the previous year, taking
the previous two months and the present month as the reference for the average.
      (3)   One adjustment, up to a maximum of $400, for high consumption will
be allowed per account during a two year period. If an incident of increased
consumption due to malfunctioning fixtures or leaks occurs again within the
designated two-year period, there shall be no further adjustment.
      (4)   A service fee of $25 shall be added to the adjusted billing (water
and/or sewer) to defer the administrative costs of administering this policy.
      (5)   A record of adjustments will be reviewed by the Director of Public
Works and the appropriate Department Head(s) before any adjustment will be
granted. Should the administrative authority reviewing the adjustment claim
decide that abnormalities or problems exist with the validity of the claim, the
adjustment will not be allowed and the bill shall be due in full.
      (6)   The filling of pools, watering of grass, or other similar use or
wasting of water shall not be grounds for requesting or receiving an
adjustment.
   (B)   Water meter testing policy.
      (1)   The Water Utility will check a customer’s meter one time, at no
charge, during any period of two years.
      (2)   If a meter is tested at the request of the customer and found to be
functioning within the current A.W.A. accuracy standards, the customer shall be
required to pay a service charge for the utilities time for each additional
testing during the two- year period. Should the meter be found to befunctioning
outside the current A.W.A. accuracy standards, the utility shall credit the
amount of any overpayment as required by state statute. If the meter is
registering less than the actual amount being consumed, the utility reserves
the right to collect the underpayment due the utility.

   (A)   Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that land development
projects increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposit; and contribute to
increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and storm water runoff, soil
erosion and non-point source pollution can be controlled and minimized through
the regulation of storm water runoff from development sites.
   (B)   Purpose. This subchapter is intended to set standards to regulate the
quantity and quality of storm water runoff when land use changes to a use that
may result in increased imperviousness. These minimum requirements are
established to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of
the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. It shall be the
policy of the town and the Lowell Storm Water Management Board that these
minimum requirements shall be required for any new development, redevelopment
and new construction located within the town not exempt under this subchapter.
This subchapter seeks to meet this purpose through the following objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature and stream
bank erosion, and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      (2)   Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality;
      (3)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls; and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (C)   Applicability. The performance standards herein must be met for all
new development areas that disturb one or more acres of land; or disturbances
of less than one acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale, if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or
more acres of land; and all redevelopment areas that disturb 10,000 square feet
of surface area or more within the town. The following activities may be exempt
from these storm water performance criteria:
      (1)   Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan; or
      (2)   Any logging and agricultural activity; or
      (3)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures; or
      (4)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the administering authority.

§ 53.203 PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Performance criteria. Prior to design, applicants are required to
consult with the administering authority to determine if they are subject to
additional storm water design requirements. Unless judged by the administering
authority to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria
shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites.
      (1)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices
to control the peak-flow rates of storm water discharge associated with
specified design storms, and to reduce the generation of storm water.
      (2)   These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm
water treatment, and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas, to the maximum extent
practical, to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
      (3)   Natural topography and land cover features, such as natural swales,
natural depressions, native soil-infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater
recharge areas, shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet
the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Minimum requirements.
      (1)   Quantity calculations - estimated.
         (a)   Design of off-site runoff, on site conveyance network, and
street drainage shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in the current
edition of the Lowell Town Standards adopted by the Lowell Town Council;
         (b)   Lot drainage.
            1.   Minimum lot grades.
               a.    Primary lot. The PRIMARY LOT is that portion of the lot
between the frontage road and the rear face of the residence or building. The
minimum grades permissible in the primary lot are as follows:
 
Type of grade   Recommended Minimum
Surface         2%          1%
Lot Line Swale  2%          1%
Cross Lot Swale 1%          0.5%
 
               b.    Secondary lot. The SECONDARY LOT is that portion of the
lot between the rear property line and the rear face of the residence or
building. The minimum grades permissible in the secondary lot are as follows:
 
Type of grade              Recommended Minimum
Surface                    1.5%        1%
Lot Line Swale             1%          0.5%
Cross Lot Swale            1%          0.5%
Surface Over Septic Fields 2%          1%
 
            2.   Common swales.
               a.   A COMMON SWALE is one that serves as a drainage course,
carrying the runoff from two or more lots or properties. (Side lot line swales
may be excepted from this requirement.)
      (2)   Quality calculations - actual: storm water quality requirements
(treatment of the WQV upon development completion). The WATER QUALITY VOLUME is
the storage needed to capture and treat the runoff from the first inch of
rainfall. In numerical terms, it is equivalent to an inch of rainfall
multiplied by the volumetric runoff coefficient (RV) and the site area.
         (a)   The following equation is used to calculate WQV (in acre-feet):
   WQV = (P) (RV) (A)
   where:
      WQV = water quality volume (acre-feet)
      P = one inch of rainfall
      RV = 0.05 + 0.009 (I) where I is the percent impervious cover
      A = area in acres
      (3)   Impact drainage areas - special requirements in protective areas.
         (a)   The administering authority is authorized, but is not required,
to classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas, and to enact
and promulgate regulations, which are generally applied. In determining impact
drainage areas, the administering authority shall consider such factors as
topography, soil type, capacity of existing regulated drains, and distance from
adequate drainage facilities. In addition to specific impact drainage areas
classified by the administering authority, the following areas are hereby
designated as impact drainage areas, unless good reason for not including them
is presented and approved by the Storm Water Management Board:
            1.   A floodway, floodway fringe or floodplain boundary as
designated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
            2.   A flood boundary area or floodway as designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency National Flood Insurance Program.
            3.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of any open channel,
regulated drain.
            4.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any regulated drain
tile.
         (b)   Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to
the maximum extent practicable.
         (c)   Where land-disturbing construction activity occurs within a
protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or
self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70% or greater shall be established and
maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat, and
filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow
conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on
the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high
velocity flows occur.
   Note to users: It is recommended that seeding of non–aggressive vegetative
cover be used in the protective areas. Vegetation that is flood- and drought-
tolerant, and can provide long-term bank stability because of an extensive root
system, is preferable.
         (d)   Best management practices, such as filter strips, swales, or wet
detention basins, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point
sources may be located in the protective area.
         (e)   This paragraph does not apply to:
            1.    Redevelopment sites;
            2.   In-fill development less than five acres; or
            3.    Structures that cross or access surface waters, such as boat
landings, bridges and culverts.
         (f)   Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive
resources (i.e., navigable waters, receiving waters with approved TMDL limits,
recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional
performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water
management practices.
      (4)   Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Special requirements for new
retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal, institutional or
commercial refueling areas, or refueling areas that replace their existing tank
systems. (Excludes individual or agricultural users.)
         (a)   Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum
extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce
petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state
contains no visible petroleum sheen.
         (b)   Note to users: A combination of the following BMPs may be used:
            1.   Oil and grease separators;
            2.    Canopies;
            3.    Petroleum spill cleanup materials; or
            4.   Any other structural or nonstructural method of preventing or
treating petroleum in runoff.
      (5)   Alternative requirements. The administrative authority may
establish storm water management requirements more stringent than those set
forth in this section, if the MS4 Operator determines that an added level of
protection is needed to protect sensitive resources.

§ 53.204 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. All development disturbing at least one acre and
all redevelopment disturbing at least 10,000 square feet must include
provisions to preserve or minimize impacts to pre-development site hydrology
and topography, to the maximum extent practicable, through runoff pollution
prevention techniques. In addition to runoff pollution prevention measures,
storm water treatment BMPs shall be incorporated into plan design as needed to
meet the performance criteria in §
53.203.
   (B)   Runoff pollution prevention.
      (1)   Storm water management begins with thoughtful design. Site planning
that integrates comprehensive storm water management from the outset is the
most effective way to reduce and prevent pollution and flooding. Good site
planning can also reduce the size and cost of structural solutions. When BMP
storm water structures are proposed only at the final stages of design and
construction, the result is often unnecessarily large and costly facilities.
Planning ahead can prevent the need for large structures.
      (2)   Site-planning practices. With careful site planning, developers and
municipalities can reduce the amount of impervious area created by pavement and
roofs, and thus, reduce the volume of runoff and associated pollutants
requiring control. Practices that could be considered:
         (a)   Select site designs that preserve or minimize impacts to pre-
development site hydrology and topography.
         (b)   Protect environmentally sensitive areas.
         (c)   Practice conservation development.
         (d)   Use cluster development.
         (e)   Create open space.
         (f)   Maximize the flow path from inflow points to outflow points.
         (g)   Provide underdrain systems, where applicable.
         (h)   Reduce hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces.
         (i)   Practice rooftop greening.
         (j)   Relax frontage and setback requirements.
         (k)   Modify sidewalk standards.
         (l)   Modify driveway standards.
         (m)   Use alternative cul-de-sac designs.
         (n)   Use alternative parking lot surfaces.
   (C)   Storm water treatment BMPs.
      (1)   Types of treatment BMPs.
         (a)   A variety of BMPs are effective in:
            1.    Filtering storm water;
            2.   Reducing the speed at which it leaves a site; and
            3.   Reducing the volume of runoff.
         (b)   These three actions are critical to reducing non-point-source
water pollution and protecting downstream water bodies.

herein. When any provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with any
building, zoning, safety, health, or other applicable law, ordinance or code of
the town or rules of the Fire Prevention Building Safety Commission existing on

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Town of Lowell Cable
Television Franchise Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2000-10, passed 4-10-00)
§ 110.002 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACT or CABLE ACT. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may be now
or hereafter amended.
   ADDITIONAL SERVICE. Any subscriber service provided by the grantee for which
a special charge is made based on program or service content, time, or spectrum
space usage.
   BASIC SERVICE. All subscriber services provided by the grantee in one or
more service tiers for an established regular monthly fee, which includes at a
minimum the delivery of local broadcast stations, and public, educational and
government access channels. BASIC SERVICE does not include optional program and
satellite service tiers, a la carte services, per channel, per program, or
auxiliary services for which a separate charge is made. However, grantee may
include other satellite signals on the “basic service” tier.
   BOARD. The Lowell Town Council.
   CABLE OPERATOR. Any person or group of persons:
      (1)   Who provides cable service over a cable system and directly or
through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable
system; or
      (2)   Who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any
arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable system. A cable
operator shall include any person or persons who own or operate an open video
system as defined by 47 U.S.C. 573, or who are a multichannel video provider
whose service is transmitted on leased telecommunications lines located within
a public street or a public way.
   CABLE SERVICE. The one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming
or other programming service and subscriber interaction, if any, which is
required for the selection or use of such programming or other programming
service. This definition does not authorize, and shall not be construed,
interpreted, or applied to authorize, the use of the cable system for
telephone, data, or voice communication services, which services are not
authorized by this chapter.
   CABLE SYSTEM or CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEM. A system of antennas, cables,
wires, lines, towers, wave guides, or other conductors, converters, equipment
or facilities, designed and constructed for the purpose of producing,
receiving, transmitting, amplifying and distributing, audio, video, and other
forms of electronic, electrical or optical signals, which includes cable
television service, and which is located in the municipality. The definition
shall not include any such facility that serves or will serve only subscribers
without using municipal rights-of-way. The definition of “cable system” shall
not be construed, interpreted, or applied to authorize telephone or voice
communication services, and no such telephone or voice communication services
are authorized by this chapter. In addition, the definition of "cable system"
shall not be deemed to circumscribe any valid authority of any governmental
body, including the municipality, to regulate the activities of telephone or
telegraph companies, or the provision of any service over the cable system that
is not a "cable service" as such term is defined herein.
   COMPLAINT. Any correspondence, whether in writing or verbal in nature,
whether in person, by telephone, or by electronic mail, from any individual,
business, unit of government, or institution to the franchising authority
concerning an unresolved alleged problem with the service or other function of
the cable system or the franchise.
   CONTROL or CONTROLLING INTEREST. Actual working control or ownership of a
system in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption of the existence
of control or a controlling interest shall arise from the beneficial ownership,
directly or indirectly, by any person or entity (except underwriters during the
period in which they are offering securities to the public) of 5% or more of a
cable system or the franchise under which the system is operated. A change in
the control or controlling interest of an entity which has control or a
controlling interest in a grantee shall constitute a change in the control or
controlling interest of the system under the same criteria. Control or
controlling interest as used herein may be held simultaneously by more than one
person or group of persons.
   CONVERTER. An electronic device which converts signals to a frequency not
susceptible to interference, within the television receiver of a subscriber,
and by an appropriate channel selector also permits a subscriber to view more
than 14 channels delivered by the system at designated converter dial
locations.
   DWELLING UNIT. A single-family or multi-family residential place of
occupancy or a business place of occupancy.
   FCC. The Federal Communications Commission, and any legally appointed,
designated or elected agent or successor.

authority of a franchise agreement between the municipality and any grantee
hereunder which allows the grantee to own, operate, construct, reconstruct,
relocate, test, use, and maintain a cable system within the corporate
boundaries of the municipality.
   FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. That certain written agreement entered into between a
grantee and the municipality wherein the franchise and the terms thereof are
conferred upon the grantee.
   FRANCHISE FEE. Any assessment imposed herein by the municipality on a
grantee solely because of its status as a grantee. The term "franchise fee"
does not include any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability
(including any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable
operators or their services) but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which
is unduly discriminatory against the grantee or cable subscribers; capital
costs which are required by the franchise to be incurred by the grantee for the
establishment of public, educational, or governmental access facilities;
requirements or charges incidental to the awarding, reviewing, enforcing, or
transferring, of the franchise, including payments for professional, legal, or
technical assistance, bonds, security funds, letters of credit, insurance,
indemnification, penalties, or liquidated damages; any fee imposed under Title
17, U.S. Code.
   FRANCHISING AUTHORITY. The corporate authorities of the city/town/village,
its Mayor/Village President, or his designee, City Council/Town Council/Village
Board, or any of its designated municipal officers or staff having
responsibility over the supervision of the city's cable television franchise.

chapter is granted by the municipality, along with the lawful successors or
assigns of such person or entity.
   GROSS REVENUES. All revenue collected directly or indirectly by the grantee,
arising from or attributable to the provision of cable service by the grantee
within the franchise area, including, but not limited to: fees charged
subscribers for any basic, optional, premium, per-channel or per-program
service; franchise fees; installation and re-connection fees; leased channel
fees; game channel fees; converter, remote control, or modem rentals, including
any Internet services as defined by the FCC as being subject to Title VI of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and bandwidth leased to unaffiliated internet
service providers to the extent permitted by law; program guide revenues;
studio or production equipment rentals; late or administrative fees; upgrade,
downgrade or other change-in-service fees; advertising revenues, including
commissions; revenues from "infomercials", home shopping and bank-at-home
channels; revenues from the sale, exchange, use or cable cast of any
programming developed on the system for community or institutional use; and any
value (at retail price levels) of any non-monetary remuneration received by
grantee in consideration of the performance of advertising or any other service
of the system which are treated as revenues. Gross revenues shall include
revenue received by any other entity other than the grantee where necessary to
prevent evasion or avoidance of the obligation under this franchise to pay the
franchise fees. Those gross revenues whose source cannot be specifically
identified with a particular subscriber shall be allocated among the units of
government served by the grantee from the cable system headend serving the
franchise area in proportion to the number of subscribers in each.
   GROSS REVENUES shall not include any bad debts, copyright fees, or taxes on
services furnished by the grantee herein imposed directly upon any subscriber

grantee on behalf of the governmental unit.

mean at least one to eight hours during which customers may be served by a

venture, corporation, or other legally recognized entity or organization,

municipality and the grantee to the use thereof for the purpose of installing
and maintaining the grantee's cable system.

representation or guarantee by the municipality that its title or interest in
any property is sufficient to permit its use for such purpose, and a franchise
shall, by the use of such term, be deemed to grant only such rights to use
property in the municipality as the municipality may have the right and power
to grant in such franchise.

which the rights and title of the municipality are such as to entitle the
municipality and the grantee to the use thereof for the purpose of installing
and maintaining the grantee's cable system. No reference in this chapter to
"public way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the
municipality that its title or interest in any property is sufficient to permit
its use for such purpose, and a franchise shall, by the use of such term, be
deemed to grant only such rights to use property in the municipality as the
municipality may have the right and power to grant in such franchise.

apply:
      (1)   At least 30 months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the
grantee shall notify, in writing the municipality of its intent to seek renewal
of the franchise.
      (2)   The grantee shall submit a written proposal for renewal which
demonstrates:
         (a)   That it has been and continues to be in substantial compliance
with the terms, conditions, and limitations of this chapter, as amended from
time to time, and its franchise;
         (b)   That its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and
operated in accordance with the accepted standards of the industry, and this
chapter, as amended from time to time, and its franchise;
         (c)   That it has the legal, technical, financial, and other
qualifications as set forth in this chapter a franchise agreement, to provide
the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in its proposal; and
         (d)   That it has made a good faith effort to provide services and
facilities which accommodate the demonstrated needs and interests of the
community as may be reasonably ascertained by the municipality, with public

services or other services provided over the system. The municipality shall
also consider the grantee's reports made to the municipality and to the FCC,
and the municipality may require the grantee to make available specified
records, documents, and information for this purpose, and may inquire
specifically whether the grantee will supply services sufficient to meet
community needs and interests in light of the costs of such needs and
interests. Provision shall be made for public comment with adequate prior
notice of at least ten days.
      (4)   The municipality shall then prepare any amendments to this chapter
and the franchise that it believes necessary.
      (5)   In the event that the municipality finds the grantee's performance
satisfactory, and finds the grantee's technical, legal, and financial abilities
acceptable, and finds the grantee's renewal proposal meets the future cable-
related needs of the community, balanced against the costs of meeting these
needs and interests, a new franchise shall be granted pursuant to this chapter
as amended for a period to be determined by the municipality.
      (6)   In the event that the grantee is determined by the municipality to
have performed unsatisfactorily, new applicants may be sought and evaluated and
a franchise award shall be made by the municipality according to franchising
procedures adopted by the municipality.

construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system.
   (D)   The letter of credit and cash security deposit shall be maintained at
the amount established herein for the entire term of the franchise, even if
amounts have to be withdrawn pursuant to this chapter. The grantee shall
promptly replace any amounts withdrawn from the letter of credit or security
deposit.
   (E)   In the event that the grantee fails to pay to the municipality any
compensation within the time fixed herein; or fails to pay to the municipality
any penalties assessed on taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the
municipality any damages, costs or expenses which the municipality incurs as a

§ 110.027 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (F) below, a franchise shall not be
assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet, hypothecated, or mortgaged,
either in whole or in part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either
legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest
in any person without the prior written approval of the municipality. The
grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a parent or wholly
owned subsidiary of the grantee and such parent or subsidiary may transfer or
assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, providing that
such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. Any
proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial responsibility as
determined by the municipality, and must agree, in writing, to comply with all
provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall submit a petition to the
municipality requesting the municipality's approval at least 90 days before the
grantee takes any action in furtherance of accomplishing any such assignment,
transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage, containing or
accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC
regulations and by the municipality. The municipality shall have 120 days to
act upon any request for approval of any such assignment, transfer, pledge,
lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage. The municipality shall be deemed to
have consented to a proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet,
hypothecation, or mortgage if it fails to render a final decision within 120
days following receipt of said petition and receipt of all necessary
information as to the effect of the proposed assignment, transfer, pledge,
lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage upon the public, unless the
requesting party and the municipality agree to an extension of time. The
municipality shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer and
shall promptly notify grantee of any action taken on such a request. Where the
municipality deems to have found the petition to be incomplete or requiring
further information, the municipality shall request further information from
the grantee within 30 calendar days from the receipt of the petition.
   (B)   The grantee shall promptly notify the municipality of any actual or
proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of,
control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to
major stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of
persons (excluding any parent or subsidiary thereof) of 5% or more of the of
grantee or the franchise under which the cable system is operated. Change,
transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee without the municipality's
consent shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the
municipality shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the municipality may
inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the municipality in such inquiry.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the municipality to any transfer of the
grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
municipality in and to any public street or public way, and any transfer shall
by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the
franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the municipality shall
not be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior
to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any assignment,
pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer of all or any part of the
grantee's cable system, or any right or interest therein, solely for financing
purposes, provided that each such assignment, pledge, lease, sublease,
mortgage, or other transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of
the municipality pursuant to this chapter, the franchise agreement, and
applicable law.

hereby reserved by the municipality to promulgate such additional regulations
as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its lawful police powers as

material rule, order, regulation or determination of the municipality made
pursuant to the franchise;
      (2)   Attempt to evade any provision of the franchise or to practice any
fraud or deceit upon the municipality or its subscribers or customers;
      (3)   Failure to begin or complete system construction or system
extension as provided under §
110.055;
      (4)   Failure to provide the services promised in the grantee's initial
application;
      (5)   Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from
the municipality;
      (6)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise; or
      (7)   Failure to pay any fees or other consideration when due pursuant to
the franchise or this chapter.
   (B)   The municipality shall make a written demand that the grantee comply
with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the
franchise. In the event that the violation by the grantee continues for a
period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof
satisfactory to the municipality that the corrective action was initiated
immediately and thereafter has been completed or has been continuously,
actively, and expeditiously pursued, the municipality may place the issue of
termination of the franchise before the Board. The municipality shall cause to
be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting,
a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place
of the meeting.
   ( C)   The Board shall hear and consider the issues and shall hear any
person interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether any
violation by the grantee has occurred. The grantee shall be afforded an
opportunity to be heard at the hearing, including an opportunity to present all
relevant evidence and witnesses and to question witnesses presented against the
grantee. The grantee may, at its own expense, make a transcript of any such
hearing.
   (D)   In the event that the Board determines that the violation by the
grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, and the grantee is
not taking actions to correct such violation if such violation could not be
corrected within the 30 day time frame mentioned above, then the Board may, by
resolution stating the violation or violations on which the decision is based,
declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be forfeited and terminated
immediately or within such period as the Board in its sole discretion may fix,
unless there is compliance.

   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of
the cable system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a
substantial part of the cable system, the grantee shall notify the municipality
of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a
change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the
franchise governing the consent of the municipality to such change in control
of the grantee shall apply.

the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the
business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have
been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless:

state and federal government or any administrative agencies thereof; provided,
however, if any such state or federal law or regulation shall require the
grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the grantee to perform any
service, or shall prohibit the grantee from performing any service, in conflict
with the terms of the franchise or of any law or regulation of the
municipality, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee
shall notify the municipality of the point of conflict believed to exist
between such regulation or law and the laws or regulations of the municipality
or the franchise.
   (B)   In the event that the municipality determines that a material

tax or other fee or charge, or if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks

110.029 or §
110.999 shall apply, as determined by the municipality.
      (4)   In special circumstances and for good cause shown by the grantee,
the municipality, in the exercise of its sole discretion, may waive 100%
completion within the two year time frame, provided that substantial completion
is accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion to be
not less than 95%. Justification for less than 100% must be submitted subject
to the approval of the municipality.
      (5)   Where the grantee is rebuilding, reconstructing, or upgrading its
cable system, such rebuilding, reconstruction, or upgrade of the cable system
must be completed within 18 months from the issuance of the initial permit for
construction. The grantee and the municipality may agree to a lesser or greater
period of time for reconstruction, rebuilding, or upgrading in a franchise
agreement.
   (B)   Line extensions.
       (1)   In areas of the franchise territory not initially served, a
grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following
requirements:
         (a)   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. To expedite
the process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the
municipality will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each
project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the
design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan.
Upon notification from the municipality that the first home in the project has
been approved for a building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three
months to complete the construction/activation process within the applicable
project phase, barring any unforeseen adverse weather or ground conditions.
         (b)   Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a grantee must
make cable service available to every unserved structure within the franchise
area. The grantee shall extend service to any annexed areas according to the
following schedule:
             1.   For areas of territory annexed to the city of five acres or
more, the grantee shall extend service to such areas within three months of the
date of annexation; or
            2.   For those areas of less than five acres, the grantee shall
extend service to such annexed areas within one month of the date of
annexation. Where unserved structures located within the franchise area have
been previously annexed into the municipality prior to the effective date of a
franchise agreement, the grantee shall extend service to such areas within 12
months for areas of less than five acres and within 18 months for areas of five
acres or more.
         (c)   The grantee shall extend and make cable service available to any
isolated resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the
standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would
require no more than a standard 125 foot drop line.
      (2)   The franchising authority may contract with owners of real property
for the installation of cable service and the construction of cable system
lines within the municipality or within one and one-half miles in order to
provide service for the area in which the real property of the owners is
located. The contract must provide, for a term not to exceed that agreed upon
between the grantee and the franchising authority in a franchise agreement, for
the payment to the owners and their assigns by any owner of real property who:
         (a)   Did not contribute to the original cost of the wiring of cable
service to the area in which the real property of the owners is located; and
         (b)   Subsequently obtains a subscription for cable service and is
served by the wiring of cable service to the area in which the real property of
the owners is located; of a pro-rata share of the cost of the construction of
the cable system subject to the conditions of this chapter, the franchise
agreement, and applicable law and notwithstanding any other law relating to the
functions of local government entities. However, the contract does not apply to
any owner of real property who is not a party to it unless it has been recorded
in the office of the recorder of Lake County before the owner has received
installation of the cable system. The franchising authority may provide that
the pro-rata share of the cost of construction include interest at a rate not
exceeding the amount of interest allowed on judgments, and the interest shall
be computed from the date that the extension of the cable system was approved
by the franchising authority to the date payment is made to the municipality.
The contract must include, as part of the consideration running to the
municipality, the release of the right of the parties to the contract and their
successors in title to remonstrate against pending or future annexations of the
municipality of the area served by the cable system. Any person who is
connected to the cable system and receives cable service contracted for is
considered to waive his/her rights to remonstrate against the annexation of the
area served by the cable system. The aforementioned does not apply if the costs
of extension of or connection to the cable system are paid by a person other
than the landowner or the municipality.
      (3)   This section shall apply when:
         (a)   Any part of the cost of a cable system is to be assessed against
the owners of real property;
         (b)   The proposed cable system is to be connected into the cable
system referenced under this chapter or a franchise agreement;
         (c)   The owners did not contribute to the cost of the extension of
the cable system.
      (4)   There shall be included in the grantee's estimate submitted to the
franchising authority and the assessments, a sum equal to the amount provided
in or computed from the contract as the fair pro-rata share due from the owners
upon and for the contracted extension of the cable system, including any
interest owed. The sum included in the grantee's estimate must be separately
itemized.
      (5)   In cases of new construction or property development where
utilities are to be placed underground, all cable system facilities also shall
be placed underground, except as otherwise specifically approved in advance by
the municipality. In the event that the grantee receives notice of such new
construction or property development, including the date on which open
trenching is available for the grantee's work (the "Notice"), then the grantee
shall provide, to the developer or property owner and to the municipality, the
specifications for its trenching, and the grantee shall install its conduit,
pedestals and vaults, and laterals within five working days after the trenches
first become available to the grantee for such work. Costs of trenching and
easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the
developer or property owner; provided, however, that if the grantee fails to
install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within said five
working days, then the cost of any new trenching, and easements if necessary,
shall be borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to the grantee at the
address stated in the franchise agreement or to the local general manager or
system engineer of the grantee. Written or oral notice from the developer,
property owner, or municipality shall be sufficient to qualify as the notice.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving
areas of the service area not covered under this section upon agreement with
developers, property owners, residents, or businesses, provided that all
applicable fees are paid by the grantee to the municipality therefor, including
without limitation the franchise fee provided in this chapter, as may be
amended from time to time.
   (D)   A grantee, in its new or renewal application, may propose a line
extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the service area
than as required above, in which case the grantee's policy will be incorporated
into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the grantee.
   (E)   Any violation of this section shall be considered a violation of this
chapter for which the provisions of either §
110.029 or §
110.999 shall apply, as determined by the municipality.

Safety Code and the National Electrical Code as now or hereafter amended.
Grantee shall also comply with any local ordinance pertaining to the
establishment of electrical grounding standards, and with any additional
grounding standards established by electric and telephone companies if grantee
has arranged to lease pole space from said companions. In the event that
grantee has erected wiring and related appurtenances upon poles owned by
private parties other than electric or telephone companies, grantee shall
comply with provisions of the National Electrical Code. The grantee, at its
discretion may properly ground said equipment in such a manner that exceeds
normal engineering requirements, provided, however, that such grounding is in
compliance with the National Electrical Code.
      (9)   In all areas of the municipality where the cables, wires and other
like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, all cables, wires
and other like facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date of
the grantee's franchise shall be placed underground. When public utilities
relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee shall
concurrently do so at no expense to the municipality.
      (10)   Where the grantee places cabling underground as part of a
relocation of cabling, or as an element of new construction or reconstruction
of the cable system, the grantee shall utilize directional boring wherever
possible.
   (C)   Plans and permits.
      (1)   Right to review; briefings.
         (a)   The municipality shall have the right to review the grantee's
construction plans and specifications prior to the commencement of any new
construction to assure compliance with the standards specified in this chapter
and to inspect all aspects of cable system construction. The municipality shall
not, however, be required to review or approve such plans and specifications or
to make such inspections, and the municipality specifically disclaims such
obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps
necessary to assure compliance with such standards and to ensure that the cable
system is installed in a safe manner and pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
         (b)   Before beginning new construction of, or on any part of, the
cable system, the grantee's chief engineer or designated individual shall meet
with the municipal administrator, manager or designated individual to provide
and explain the grantee's construction plans and work program in detail.
Similar briefings shall be held from time to time as deemed necessary by either
the municipality or the grantee until the work is completed.
      (2)   The grantee shall, within 90 days after the effective date of its
franchise, furnish to the municipality complete "as-built" plans of the cable
system and shall, thereafter, furnish to the municipality amendments to such
plans within 45 days after completion of any extension or modification of the
cable system. If so requested by the grantee, the municipality shall keep such
as-built plans confidential to the extent allowable by law, and shall show such
plans only to those employees, contractors or municipality officials who need
to see them as a part of their responsibilities to the municipality, or
pursuant to their responsibilities for locating utilities. Upon implementation
of a municipal Geographic Information System (GIS), the grantee shall provide
said "as-built" plans in a digital format which is compatible to the computer
systems of the grantee and the municipality.
      (3)   The grantee shall obtain permits from the municipality before
commencing any new construction of or within the cable system, with specific
permission being required for the opening or disturbance of any public street
or public way within the municipality. The permit application shall include a
plan drawn in sufficient detail to demonstrate to the municipality that the
cable system will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes and
ordinances. Where cable is to be installed on existing poles, the permit
application shall include a drawing showing the existing poles and additional
poles, if requested. Without characterizing the violation of other provisions
of this chapter, the failure to obtain said permits shall constitute a material
violation of this chapter. The grantee also, before the commencement of new
construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, shall become and remain a
member of the J.U.L.I.E. system, or the utility locating system serving Lake
County, Indiana ("Holey Moley"). The grantee may redact any information which
it deems proprietary.
   (D)   All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair,
and removal of the cable system, or any part thereof, shall be performed in a
workmanlike manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any
time, it is determined by the municipality or any other agency or authority of
competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable system, including without
limitation any means used to distribute signals over or within the cable
system, is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then the grantee, at
its sole cost and expense, shall promptly correct all such conditions. Any
contractor, subcontractor, or other person proposed to be employed for the
installation, maintenance, relocation, or repair of cable system equipment or
facilities shall be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and shall be
thoroughly experienced in the work for which he or she is retained.
   (E)   The grantee shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations
for infrastructure specifications as found in Appendix A of this chapter and
any and all rules and regulations enacted or to be enacted by the municipality
with reference to construction activity in public streets or public ways. All
poles, wires, conduits, cables, equipment, pipes, appurtenances, structures,
and other facilities of the cable system shall be installed and located in
compliance with all applicable municipal codes and ordinances and the
applicable provisions of the franchise so as to cause minimum interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of the general public, all as determined
by the municipality in its sole and absolute discretion. Unless the
municipality shall in writing waive its right to review plans, no construction
or other work relating to such facilities within the public streets and public
ways of the municipality shall be commenced until the municipality shall have
approved and issued a permit on the plans, specifications and methods for such
work. Any such permit may be so conditioned or restricted as deemed necessary
by the municipality to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. All such
facilities shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe condition and in
good order and repair.
   (F)   Location of pedestals and vaults.
      (1)   Pedestals and similar above ground appurtenances.
         (a)   The municipality has determined that pedestals and similar
aboveground appurtenances located on a public street or public way (other than
in an alley or as provided in division (c) below or on public property will
adversely affect the appearance of the municipality and of the property therein
and, accordingly, pursuant to Section 541(a)(2) of the Cable Act, the grantee
shall not under any circumstances install or locate a pedestal or any similar
above ground appurtenance on any public street or public way (other than in an
alley or as provided in division (c) below) or on any public property as a part
of any new construction or any relocation or reinstallation.
         (b)    Pedestals or similar above ground appurtenances may be
installed on private property only with the express, prior written consent and
permission of the affected property owner or his or her authorized agent, or
the duly elected or appointed representative of the affected property;
provided, however, that such pedestals or above ground appurtenances shall
comply with all applicable provisions of the Municipal Code.
         (c)    Notwithstanding division (b) above, pedestals or similar above
ground appurtenances may be installed within certain utility easements on
private property without the consent or permission of the affected property
owner provided that:
            1.   The grantee is lawfully authorized to use such utility
easement pursuant to applicable state or federal law;
            2.   No such pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance may be
installed unless, at the time of the desired installation, there exists within
the utility easement, a similar above ground appurtenance of another utility
company or entity;
            3.   The grantee's pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance
shall be located as close as is practicable to said existing above ground
appurtenance; and
            4.   In the event of an emergency, the grantee shall attempt to
contact the property owner or legal tenant in person and shall leave a door
hanger notice in the event personal contact is not made.
      (2)   Vaults.
         (a)   The grantee shall not install underground vaults on any public
street or public way after the effective date of this franchise, except in
accordance with and pursuant to the provisions of division (2)(d) below. All
underground vaults shall be flush mounted with the surface of the land area.
         (b)   The grantee shall inform the owner of any private property in
the municipality where the grantee contemplates placing a vault on the parkway
immediately adjacent to said private property, that the owner has the right to
elect between the construction and installation of an underground vault on the
owner's private property or on the public street or public way (including,
without limitation, the parkway) immediately adjacent to the owner's property.
Said notice shall be in writing, in form and substance acceptable to the
Municipal Administrator or Manager, and delivered by certified mail or personal
delivery to said owner at least 30 days immediately before the commencement of
construction on or around the owner's property.
         (c)   In the event that the owner elects to allow construction and
installation of an underground vault on the owner's property, then the owner
shall be required to grant the grantee an easement, in form reviewed and
approved by the municipality's attorney, allowing for such construction and
installation.
         (d)   In the event that the owner:
            1.   Elects not to allow construction and installation of an
underground vault on the owner's property; or
            2.   Fails to respond to the election notice delivered by the
grantee pursuant to division (2)(b) above within 45 days after the owner
receives the notice; or
            3.   Refuses to grant the grantee the easement pursuant to division
(2)(c) above within 30 days after the owner's receipt of an easement document,
then the grantee shall be entitled to construct and install an underground
vault on the public way (including, without limitation, the parkway) that is
immediately adjacent to the owner's property.
   (G)   Trenching Requirements. The grantee shall excavate all trenches at a
depth no less than that required by the National Electrical Code for the
installation of drop cable, feeder cable and trunk cable. All open trenches in
which work is being performed shall be covered at the end of each working day,
and when the trench is not occupied by a work crew, with a wooden covering in a
public way, or with a metal covering where work is being performed in a public
street. Coverings shall be adequately secured in order to prevent movement of
the trench cover which would expose the trench opening.

   (A)   The grantee's system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located,
erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or
interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public streets and public
ways, or interfere with any improvements the municipality may make, or hinder
or obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public
property.
   (B)   Erection, removal and common uses of poles.
      (1)   No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the
grantee without prior approval of the municipality with regard to location,
height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole
or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such
poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own
expense whenever the municipality determines that the public convenience would
be enhanced thereby.
      (2)   Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for
use in serving the municipality are available for use by the grantee, but it
does not make arrangements for such use, the municipality may require the
grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public
convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the
grantee are just and reasonable.
      (3)   Where the municipality or a public utility serving the municipality
desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the
grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the
municipality may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration
and upon such terms as the municipality shall determine to be just and
reasonable, if the municipality determines that the use would enhance the
public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's
operations.
   (C)   If at any time during the period of the franchise the municipality
shall elect to alter, or change the grade of any public street or other public
ways or utilities, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the municipality,
shall promptly remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables,
underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense.
   (D)   The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit issued by the municipality, temporarily raise or lower its wires
to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal,
raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same,
and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance.
The grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for
such temporary wire changes.

public ways shall not be exclusive. The municipality reserves the right to
grant any right or use of such public streets or public ways to any person at
any time during the term of the franchise or any other franchise subsequently
granted to any other person.
   (G)   If any public street or public way or portion thereof used by the
grantee shall be vacated by the municipality, or the use thereof is
discontinued by the municipality or the grantee, during the term of the
franchise, then the grantee shall forthwith at its sole cost and expense remove
its facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted to continue to use the
same and, on the removal thereof, the grantee shall restore, repair, or
reconstruct the public street or public way in accordance with the
specifications and requirements found in Appendix A. In the event of any
failure, neglect, or refusal by the grantee, after 30 days written notice from
the municipality to repair, improve, or maintain such public street or public
way, the municipality may, but shall be under no obligation to, conduct such
work, or cause it to be conducted, and the actual cost thereof shall be paid by
the grantee in the time and manner as directed by the municipality. Collection
may be made by resort to the letter of credit or cash security deposit
established pursuant to §

subscriber credits shall be applied by the grantee:
      (1)   If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four
hours or more on one, two, or three days in any calendar month, then the
grantee shall provide a credit to that subscriber equal to 1/30 of one month's
total fees paid by that subscriber for each day on which such a service
interruption occurs; provided, however, that such credit shall not apply to a
subscriber disconnected because of non-payment or excessive signal leakage.
Such credit shall be provided by the grantee automatically upon notice from
that subscriber of such service interruption, regardless of whether that
subscriber requests a credit.
      (2)   If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four
hours or more on four or more days in any calendar month, then the Grantee
shall provide a credit to that Subscriber equal to one month's total fees paid

   (C)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists
other evidence, which, in the judgment of the municipality, in consultation
with the grantee, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service,
the municipality shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to
test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall
fully cooperate with the municipality in performing such testing and shall

failures to meet the requirements of this chapter. Grantee shall cooperate and
permit such testing.
   (E)   The municipality shall require tests, analysis and reports covering
specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence

ENFORCEMENT
§ 110.100 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Whenever the municipality determines that the grantee has violated any
term, condition or provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, and
determines it appropriate to impose monetary penalties, a written notice shall
be given to the grantee informing it of such alleged violation or liability.
The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation
so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee
shall have 30 days notice subsequent to the date of such notice in which the
grantee shall have the opportunity to cure the violation before the
municipality may impose penalties unless the violation is, in the opinion of
the municipality, of such a nature so as to require more than 30 days and the
grantee proceeds, immediately upon receipt of such notice, and continuously,
and diligently, to cure the violation. In any case where the violation is not
cured within 30 days of notice from the municipality, or such other time to
which the grantee and the municipality may mutually agree, the municipality may
proceed to impose penalties and to exercise any other remedy provided in this
chapter or the franchise agreement.
   (B)   The grantee may, within ten days of receipt of notice, notify the
municipality that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has,
in fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the municipality shall specify
with particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the
running of the 30 day cure period pending decision by the governing body as
required below. The governing body shall hear the grantee's dispute. The
grantee must be given at least five days notice of the hearing. At the hearing,
the grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to
be represented by counsel. In the event the municipality upholds the finding of
a violation, the grantee shall have 15 days thereafter or the remaining time
period set in division (A) above, whichever is longer, or such other time
period as the grantee and the municipality mutually agree, to correct the
violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within 30 days of
notice from the municipality, or such other time to which the grantee and the
municipality may mutually agree, the municipality may proceed to impose
penalties retroactive to the date of notice to cure said violation(s) and to
exercise any other remedy provided in this chapter or the franchise agreement.
   (C)   The rights reserved to the municipality under this section are in
addition to all other rights of the municipality whether reserved by this
chapter or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise
of a right shall affect any other right the municipality may have.

APPENDIX A: INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS
CHAPTER 1: EXCAVATION, RESTORATION AND CLEAN UP
Section 1: Excavation and Backfill for Underground Conduits
1-1 Description
For the purpose of this section, underground conduits shall be considered sewer
pipe, water main, culverts, or any other pipe conduits indicated on the plans.
Wherever the term "pipe" or "pipe line" is used, it shall mean underground
conduit.
Excavation and backfill shall include all excavation backfilling, compacting,
disposal of surplus material, restoration of all disturbed surface, and all
other work incidental to the construction of trenches, including any additional
excavation which may be required for manholes or other structures forming a
part of the pipe line.
1-2 Construction Details
1-2.01 Surface Removal:
Along the proposed pipe lines as indicated on the plans, the contractor shall
remove the surface materials only to such widths as will permit a trench, to be
excavated which will afford sufficient room for proper efficiency and proper
construction. Where sidewalks, driveways, pavements and curb and gutter are
encountered, care shall be taken to protect such against fracture or
disturbance beyond reasonable working limits. In areas specified on the plans,
the top twelve inches (12") shall be piled separately and preserved so that it
may be restored after the remainder of the backfill is replaced.
1-2.02 Excavation by Hand of Machine:
When working space will permit, trenches may be excavated by machine, provided
that by so doing, public and private improvements will not be subjected to an
unreasonable amount of damage. If, however, excavation by machine methods
cannot be made without material damage being done to public and private
improvements, hand excavation shall be employed.
1-2.03 Width of Excavation
a.   The bottom of the trench at and below the top of the pipe and inside the
sheeting and bracing, if used, shall not exceed the following widths:
Pipe       Pipe        Pipe
Size    Width   Size     Width Size   Width
6"    2'6"    27"    4'3"    66"   9'1"
8"   2'6"    30"    4'7"   72"   9'8'
10"    2'6"    33"    5'4"    78"   10'3"
12"    2'8"    36"    5'8"   84"   10'10"
15"    2'10"    42"    6'3"    90   11'5"

24"   4'0"    60"    8'6"    108"   13'2"
Note: The strength or class of pipe shall be as indicated on the plans or
special provisions.
b.   Trench sheeting and bracing or a trench shield shall be used as required
by the rules and regulation of O.S.H.A. The bottom of the trench excavation
shall conform to the details shown on the plan.
1-2.04 Excavation below Grade:
In cases where the excavation is carried beyond or below the lines and grades
given by the Engineer, the Contractor shall refill all such excavated space
with suitable granular material.
1-2.05 Rock Excavation
1-2.05A General:
Whenever "rock" is used as the name of an excavated material, it shall mean
boulders or pieces of rock, concrete, or masonry measuring one-half (1/2) cubic
yard or more, hard shale or solid ledge rock and masonry which, in the opinion
of the Engineer, requires for its removal the continuous use of pneumatic tools
or drilling or blasting.
1-2.06 Braced and Sheeted Trenches
1-2.06A General:
Open-cut trenches shall be sheeted and braced or otherwise protected as
required by any governing Federal, State or County laws and municipal
ordinances, and as may be necessary to protect life, property, or the work. In
any event, the minimum protection shall conform to the recommendations in
O.S.H.A. Safety and Health Standards for Construction. A sand box or trench
shield may be used in lieu of sheeting as permitted by O.S.H.A. and approved by
the Engineer. When close-sheeting is used, it shall be so driven as to prevent
adjacent soil from entering the trench either below or through such sheeting.
Where sheeting and bracing are used, the trench width shall be increased
accordingly. The Engineer may order the sheeting driven to the full depth of
the trench or to such additional depth as may be required for the protection of
the work. Where soil in the lower limits of the trench has the necessary
stability to meet the O.S.H.A. Standards, the Engineer, at his discretion, may
permit the contractor to stop the driving of sheeting at such designated
elevation above the trench bottom. The granting of permission by the Engineer,
however, shall not relieve the Contractor in any degree from his full
responsibility under the Contract. Sheeting and bracing which have been ordered
left in place shall be cut off at the elevation ordered by the Engineer. Trench
bracing, except that ordered left in place, may be removed when the backfilling
has reached the respective levels of such bracing. Sheeting, except that
ordered left in place, may be removed after the backfilling has been completed
or has been brought to such an elevation as to permit its safe removal.
1-2.07 Trenches With Sloping Sides, Limited:
The Contractor may, at his option, where working conditions and right-of-way
permit (as determined by the Engineer), excavate pipeline trenches with sloping
sides, but with the following limitations:
In general, only braced and vertical trenches will be permitted in traveled
streets, alleys or narrow easements.
Where trenches with sloping sides are permitted, the slopes shall not extend
below the top of the sewer, and trench excavations below this point shall be
made with vertical sides with widths not exceeding those specified herein
before for the various sizes of pipe.
1-2.08 Short Tunnels:
In some instances, trees, fire hydrants, sidewalks and other obstructions may
be encountered, the proximity of which may be a hindrance to open-cut
excavation. In such cases, the Contractor shall excavate by means of short
tunnels in order to protect such obstructions against damage.
1-2.09 Piling Excavated Material:
All excavated material shall be piled in a manner that will not endanger the
work and that will avoid obstructing streets, alleys, sidewalks and driveways.
Fire hydrants under pressure, valve pit covers, valve boxes, curb stop boxes,
or other utility controls shall be left unobstructed and accessible until the
work is completed. Gutters shall be kept clear or other satisfactory provisions
made for street drainage. Natural watercourses shall not be obstructed.
1-2.10 Removal of Water:
The Contractor shall, at all times during construction, provide and maintain
ample means and devices with which to promptly remove and properly dispose of
all water entering the excavations or other parts of the work until all work to
be performed therein has been completed. No sanitary sewer shall be used for
disposal of trench water.
1-2.11 Safety
1-2.11A Barricades, Guards and Safety Provisions:
To protect persons from injury and to avoid property damage, adequate
barricades, construction signs, torches, red lanterns and guards, as required,
shall be placed and maintained by the Contractor at his expense during the
progress of the construction work and until it is safe for traffic to use the
roads and streets. All material piles, equipment and pipe which may serve as
obstructions to traffic shall be protected by proper lights when the visibility
is poor. The rules and regulations of O.S.H.A. and appropriate authorities
respecting safety provisions shall be observed.
1-2.11B Structure Protection:
Temporary support, adequate protection and maintenance of all underground and
surface structures, water mains, drains, sewers and other obstructions
encountered in the progress of the work shall be furnished by the Contractor
under the direction of the Engineer. The structures which may have been
disturbed shall be restored upon completion of the work.
1-2.11C Protection of Property and Surface Structures:
Trees, shrubbery, fences, poles and all other property and surface structures
shall be protected during construction operations unless their removal for
purposes of construction is authorized by the Engineer. Any fences, poles, or
other man made surface improvements, which are moved or disturbed by the
Contractor, shall be restored to the original conditions, after construction is
completed. Any trees,
shrubbery, or other vegetation, which are approved for removal or ordered for
removal by the Engineer in order to facilitate construction operations, shall
be removed completely, including stumps and roots, by the Contractor.
Responsibility for any damage or claims for damage caused by construction
operations to shrubbery or other landscape improvements which were not
authorized for removal by the Engineer shall be assumed by the Contractor.
1-2.12 Deviations Occasioned by Other Structures or Utilities:
Whenever obstructions are encountered during the progress of the work and
interfere to such as extent that an alteration in the plan is required, the
Engineer shall have the authority to approve the plans and order a deviation
from the line and grade or arrange with the owners of the structures for the
removal, relocation or reconstruction of the obstructions. Where gas, water,
telephone, electrical, hot water, steam, or other existing utilities are an
impediment to the vertical or horizontal alignment of the proposed pipe line,
the engineer shall require a change in grade or alignment or shall direct the
Contractor to arrange with the owners of the utilities for their removal.
1-2.13 Interruption to Utilities:
The Contractor shall proceed with caution in the excavation and preparation of
the trench so that the exact location of underground structures may be
determined. Prior to proceeding with trench excavation, the Contractor shall
contact all utility companies in the area to aid in locating their underground
services.
The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions against damage to existing
utilities. However, in the event of a break in an existing water main, gas
main, sewer of underground cable, he shall immediately notify the responsible
official of the organization operating the utility interrupted. The Contractor
shall lend all possible assistance in restoring services and shall assume all
cost, charges, or claims connected with the interruption and repair of such
services if the location of said utility was marked by the owner thereof prior
to excavation.
1-2.14 Maintenance of Traffic and Closing of Streets:
The Contractor shall carry on the work in a manner, which will cause a minimum
of interruption to traffic, and may not close a street to through travel
without the express approval of the Director of Operations. Where traffic must
cross open trenches, the Contractor shall provide suitable bridges at street
intersections and driveways. The Contractor shall post, where directed by the
Engineer, suitable signs indicating that a street is closed and necessary
detour signs for the proper, maintenance of traffic. Prior to closing of any
driving lanes of a street, the Contractor shall notify responsible municipal
authorities; including the Director of Operations, Police, Fire and School.
1-2.164 Construction in Easements:
In easements across private property, the Contractor shall be responsible and
liable for all damage outside of the easement area. Trees, fences, shrubbery or
other type of surface improvements located in the easements will require
protection during construction. The provisions of paragraph 1-2.11C above shall
apply to all easement areas as well as to public right-of-way. Precautions
shall be taken by adequate sheeting or other approved methods to prevent any
cave-in or subsidence beyond the easement limits or damage to improvements
within the easement. In general, the easement area is intended to provide
reasonable access and working area for efficient operation by the Contractor.
Where easement space for the efficient operation is not provided, the
Contractor shall be responsible for organizing his operations to perform within
the restrictions indicated.
1-2.16 Underground Conduit Constructed in Tunnel
1-2.16A General:
Where required by the Engineer, pipe lines shall be constructed in tunnel. This
work will be conducted in accordance with requirements of any permits obtained
by the Owner from railroads or state or county highway departments for tunnel
work or in accordance with the following paragraphs:
1-2.16B Materials:
Pipe materials shall be shown on the plans or as described in the special
provisions.
1-2.16C Excavation and Laying:
Requirements for excavation, laying, and joints shall be those applicable for
the type of pipe line involved, unless otherwise specified.
1-2.16D Methods of Construction:
The tunnel shall be only of sufficient width and height to provide free working
space. The sides and roof of the tunnel shall be braced sufficiently to support
the external loads and to prevent caving, bulging, and settlement of the earth.
The Contractor shall backfill all tunnels with well-compacted sand, fine gravel
or stone screenings as rapidly as the conditions permit.
The backfill material shall be deposited in the tunnel in such a manner as not
to injure or disturb the pipe. The filling of the tunnel shall be carried on
simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in such a manner that injurious side
pressures do not occur. Special care shall be taken to compact the backfill
under the haunches of the pipe. The remainder of the tunnel, or such portion of
the remainder as maybe possible, shall then be backfilled by one (1) of the
following methods, at the option of the Contractor, if in the opinion of the
Engineer the method is practicable.
a.   The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not to exceed twelve
(12") thick (loose measure) and such layer either inundated or deposited in
water.
b.   The tunnel shall be backfilled with loose material or only partly
backfilled at a time. If necessary, and settlement secured in either case by
introducing water through holes jetted into the material to a point
approximately two feet (2') above the top of the pipe.
If neither of the above methods is practicable or can be used for only a
portion of the backfill, the remainder of the tunnel shall be completely
backfilled with material carefully deposited in layers and each layer compacted
by ramming or tamping with tools approved by the Engineer.
When sheeting and bracing have been used, sufficient bracing shall be left
across the trench as the backfilling progresses to hold the sides and top
firmly in place without caving or settlement before the backfilling has been
placed. This bracing may be removed as soon as practicable.
Any depressions which may develop within the area involved in the construction
operations due to settlement of the backfilling material shall be filled in a
manner meeting the approval of the Engineer.
1-2.16E Use of Casing Pipe:
The Contractor may, subject to the approval of the Engineer, use metal casing
pipe as a tunnel liner in place of timber shoring for tunnel sections. The
diameter, gauge and type of such pipe, method of placing and method of
installing pipe within it shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The
entire void space between tunnel liners and pipe shall be filled with compacted
sand or other approved material if such method of construction is used.
1-2.16F Jacking or Boring of Pipe:
The Contractor may, subject to the approval of the Engineer, use special cast
iron or specially designed reinforced concrete pipe jack and/or bored into
position with or without tunnel liners, for tunneled sections of pipe. In such
cases, all conditions of performance of the work shall be subject to the
approval of the Engineer.
1-2.17 Excavation and Foundation:
The trench shall be excavated to an elevation of four inches (4") below the
bottom of the pipe and so that the flow line of the finished sewer will be at
the depth and grade specified or established by the Engineer.
Well compacted moist fine aggregate bedding material, at least four inches (4")
in depth below the pipe, shall be placed the entire width of the trench and for
the length of the pipe. The fine aggregate shall meet the approval of the
Engineer and shall be compacted to his satisfaction by ramming or tamping with
tolls approved by the Engineer.
When pipe having bells or hubs is used, cross trenches, not more than two
inches (2") wider than the bell or hub, shall be excavated to provide uniform
bearing along the length of the pipe.
If the excavation has been made deeper than necessary, the foundation shall be
brought to the proper grade by the addition of well compacted bedding material.
Where a firm foundation is not encountered at the grade established, due to
soft, spongy, or other unsuitable soil, all such unsuitable soil under the pipe
and for the width of the trench shall be removed and replaced with well
compacted bedding material.
Where rock, in either ledge or boulder formation, is encountered, it shall be
removed below grade and replaced with a cushion of well compacted bedding
material having a thickness under the pipe of not less than eight inches (8").
1-2.17A Concrete Cradle
1-2.17A(1) General:
Where sub-grade conditions, in the opinion of the Engineer, warrant extra
precautions for the bedding of pipe, the Engineer may require the construction
of a concrete cradle to be installed in conformance with the size and
dimensions indicated on the plans. All concrete used in concrete cradle shall
have a minimum compressive strength of twenty-five hundred (2,500) psi at
twenty-eight (28) days.
1-2.18 Backfill:
As soon as the condition of the pipe will permit, the entire width of the
trench shall be backfilled, with moist fine aggregate to a height of at least
the elevation of the center of the pipe. The fine aggregate shall be placed
longitudinally along the pipe. The elevation of the backfill material on each
side of the pipe shall be the same. Special care shall be taken to completely
fill the space under the pipe. The fine aggregate backfill material shall be
placed in four (4") inch layers, loose measurement, and compacted to the
satisfaction of the Engineer by ramming or tamping with tools approved by the
Engineer. The fine aggregate used for backfilling shall meet the approval of
the Engineer.
The remainder of the trench and excavation shall be backfilled to the natural
line or finished surface as rapidly as the condition of the sewer will permit.
The backfill material shall consist of the excavated material or trench
backfill; as herein specified. All backfill material shall be deposited in the
trench or excavation in such a manner as not to damage the sewer. The filling
of the trench shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in
such a manner that injurious side pressures do not occur. The backfill for
trenches and excavation made in the sub-grade of the proposed improvement, and
for all trenches outside of the sub-grade where the inner edge of the trench is
within two (2') feet of the edge of the proposed pavement, curb, gutter, curb
and gutter, stabilized shoulder or sidewalk, shall be made with trench backfill
material unless the excavated material meets the requirements of Section 211 of
the Indiana State Highway Standard Specifications.
All backfill material up to a height of twelve (12") inches above the pipe
shall be carefully deposited in uniform layers not exceeding four (4") inches
thick (loose measure). The material in each layer shall be firmly compacted by
ramming or tamping with tools approved by the Engineer, in such a manner as not
to disturb or injure the pipe. The backfilling above this height shall be done
by Method 1, 2 or 3 below.
When required, trench backfill material or excavated material meeting the
requirements of Section 211 of the Indiana State Highway Specifications above
the
first twelve (12") inches above the pipe shall be compacted by either Method 2
or Method 3 specified below, or in accordance with Method 1 except that the
compacted lifts shall not exceed four inches (4") in thickness.
Method l: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding
twelve inches (12") thick (loose measure) and each layer shall be compacted by
ramming or tamping with tools approved by the Engineer.
Method 2: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding
twelve inches (12") thick (loose measure), and each layer shall be either
inundated or deposited in water.
Method 3: The trench shall be backfilled with loose material and settlement
secured by introducing water through holes jetted into the backfill to a point
approximately two feet (2') above the top of the pipe. The holes shall be
spaced as directed by the Engineer, but shall not be any further than six (6')
feet apart.
The water shall be injected at a pressure just sufficient to sink the holes at
a moderate rate of speed. The pressure shall be such that the water will not
cut cavities in the backfill material nor overflow the surface. If water does
overflow the surface, it shall be drained into the jetted holes by means of
shallow trenches. Water shall be injected as long as it will be absorbed by the
backfill material and until samples taken from test holes in the trench show a
satisfactory moisture content. The Contractor shall bore the test holes not
more than fifty feet (50') apart and at such other locations in the trench
designated by the Engineer. As soon as the water soaking has been completed,
all holes shall be filled with soil and compacted by ramming with a tool
approved by the Engineer.
Backfill material which has been water soaked shall be allowed to settle and
dry for at least ten (10) days before any surface course or pavement is
constructed on it. The length of time may be altered if deemed desirable by the
Engineer. Where the inner edge of the trench is within two feet (2') of the
edge of the proposed pavement, curb, gutter, or curb and gutter, the provisions
of this paragraph shall also apply.
At the end of the settling and drying period, the crusted top of the backfill
material shall be scarified and, if necessary, sufficient backfill material
added, as specified in Method 1, to complete the backfilling operations.
The method used for backfilling and compacting the backfilling material will be
the choice of the Contractor. However, if the method used does not produce
results satisfactory to the Engineer, the Contractor will be required to alter
or change the method being used so that the resultant backfill will be
satisfactory to the Engineer.
Section II: Restoration of Surfaces
2-1 General:
Restoration of surfaces shall include the removal of the existing surface the
disposal of surplus material, and the construction of new surfaces as indicated
on the plans or special provisions. The type of surface restoration required
shall be shown on the plans or described in the special provisions.
2-2 Construction Details
2-2.01 Temporary Surface Over Trench:
Wherever conduits are constructed under traveled roadways, driveways,
sidewalks, or other traveled surfaces, a temporary surface shall be placed over
the top of the trench as soon as possible after compaction, as specified above,
has been satisfactorily completed. The temporary surface shall consist of a
minimum of six inches (6") of coarse aggregate conforming to the current
specifications of the Indiana State Highway Specifications for Grade No. 53.
The top of the temporary surface shall be smooth and meet the grade of the
adjacent undisturbed surface. The temporary surface shall be maintained at the
Contractor's expense until final restoration of the street surface is completed
as specified. No permanent restoration of street surface shall be initiated
until authorized by the Engineer.
2-2.02 Removal of Pavement, Sidewalk, Driveway and Curb:
Wherever the pipe is located along or across an improved surface, the width of
the trench shall be held as nearly as possible to the maximum width specified
in Section 1-2.03. Where brick or concrete pavement, sidewalk, driveway or
curbing is cut, the width of the cut shall exceed the actual width of the top
of the trench by twelve inches (12") on each side or a total of two feet (2').
Exposed surfaces of portland cement or asphaltic concrete shall be cut with a
pavement saw before breaking. Care shall be taken in cutting to insure that a
straight joint is sawed.

§ 130.03 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law- abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property
utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free
passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person
to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open
to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

licensee may request a hearing in front of the Board.
   (B)   The Board may, upon a complaint filed by a member of the Building

after service of notice to appear and answer to the complaint showing cause, if
any, why his or her license should not be suspended or revoked. The licensee
may request a hearing on the charges, and the Board shall, within 30 days, set
a date for a hearing. The complaint shall contain a statement of facts
pertaining to the specific charges of the violation of this subchapter, other

§ 150.42 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   No building or structure shall be used or occupied, and no change in
the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion
thereof shall be made until the Director has issued a certificate of occupancy
therefor as provided herein. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not
be construed as an approval of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or
of other ordinances of the town. Certificates presuming to give authority to
violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or other ordinances of the
town shall not be valid.
   (B)   Before a certificate of occupancy will be issued, the following
requirements shall be met:
      (1)   The dwelling unit and/or structure must be completed to the extent
that the occupant's safety and health will not be endangered.

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-
4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of Lowell does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
      (6)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health.
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas.

§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any

         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;

      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information. The certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.

subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY and FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning
regulations, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose codes, and other applications of police power which control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also
referred to as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE
PREVENTION ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town of
Lowell Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market

replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) of 1929. As corrected in 1929, it is
a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, it is a

within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. See REGULATORY
FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
(3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck;
and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters
for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.03(B). The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-
PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town are
generally identified as such on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-
A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO). The SFHA may also be identified by best available
data regulatory data maps provided by, or approved by, the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive loss"
or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, and X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

§ 151.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter's
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Lake County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated January 18, 2012 and the corresponding
flood insurance rate map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an "A
Zone" on the Lake County, Indiana and incorporated areas flood insurance rate
map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles included in the effective FIS shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall
be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be
applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements.
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Violations. Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the
SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development
permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this
chapter.

structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
      (10)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume
of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill and structure below the
BFE shall be compensated for by excavating a volume below the BFE which is
twice the fill volume below the BFE. The compensatory excavation volume shall
be at least equal to twice the volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of 2
to 1) due to the fill and structure.
         (a)   The compensatory excavation shall take place in the SFHA at a
location where the BFE is within one foot of the BFE at the fill location. The
compensatory excavation shall take place at a location upstream of the fill
location.
         (b)   Under certain circumstances, the compensatory excavation may be
allowed to take place outside of but adjacent to the SFHA provided that the
excavated volume will be below the BFE, will be at a location where the BFE is
within one foot of the BFE at the fill location, will allow for inundation by
the regulatory flood water, will freely drain when not inundated by flood
water, and that it be maintained into perpetuity.
         (c)   The compensatory excavation shall provide for storage of
floodwater but shall be freely draining when not inundated by flood water.
         (d)   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading
to the SFHA.
         (e)   The grading around the compensatory excavation shall allow for
inundation by the regulatory flood water.
         (f)   The fill and structure shall be certified as substantially safe
from flooding per FEMA TB 10-01 and shall include provisions to protect
adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or drainage resulting
from its placement.
         (g)   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
compensatory excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and compensatory
excavation comply with this division.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of §
151.05(A), all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from

in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of §
151.05(B)(4). Periodic inspections will be conducted by the Floodplain
Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit shall be recorded in the
office of the Lake County Recorder.
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Lake County Recorder.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep

improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage"
as a result of a flood:
            i.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
            ii.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
151.05(B)(4).
            iii.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the
frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (b)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood:
            i.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
            ii.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
151.05(B)(4).
            iii.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the
frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            i.   Be on site for less than 180 days;
            ii.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            iii.   Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as stated
earlier in this section.
      (7)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
         (a)   Shall not be used for human habitation.
         (b)   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials.
         (c)   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum
resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (d)   Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the FPG.
         (f)   Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in §
151.05(B)(4).
      (8)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA
and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
      (6)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA
for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders). Access routes
shall be elevated to allow a maximum inundation depth of one foot during the
regulatory flood.
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.03(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this section have been met. The floodplain
development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction
in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a
community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
      (3)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation
under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition
as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in this section
have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new
or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the
floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the
regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the
regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (H)   Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone
areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available,
shall meet applicable standards as required per this section.

board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Circuit or Superior Court.
   (C)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter; and
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (4)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.   
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site.
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
151.05(E) or (G)(1) may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
151.05(E) or (G)(1) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
151.05(B), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (see division (E)).
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see division (E)).
   (E)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood
protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood
protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (F)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (G)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the Town of Lowell Board of
Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

hearing date, in the manner prescribed by §

authority or by a contractor acting under IC 36-7-9-11, each person who held a

premises.
         (b)   The cost of notice of orders, notice of statements of

         (d)   The cost of supplies, equipment, and office space.
   (B)   The BZA shall determine the amount of the average processing expense

the average processing expense, the board or commission may fix the amount at a
full dollar amount that is an even multiple of ten.
   (C)   Unpaid costs are subject to the procedures in IC 36-7-9-13 and 36-7-9-
13.5, and may result in a judgment, special tax assessment, and/or lien on real
or personal property or persons responsible for such costs.

than an order under §
153.05(A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4) of this chapter, and if the cost of this work is
estimated to be less than $10,000, the department, acting through the town's
enforcement authority or other agent, may perform the work by means of the
town's own workers and any equipment owned or leased by the town and, if done
in this manner:

         (a)   The work must be let at public bid to a contractor licensed and
qualified under law.
         (b)   The obligation to pay costs imposed by §
153.10 of this chapter is based on the condition of the unsafe premises at the
time the public bid was accepted. Changes occurring in the condition of the
unsafe premises after the public bid was accepted do not eliminate or diminish
this obligation.
      (3)   If the work is being performed under an order issued under §
153.05(A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4) of this chapter, the work may be performed by:

153.06(A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4) of this chapter may be performed without
further notice to the persons holding a fee interest, life estate interest, or
equitable interest of a contract purchaser, and these persons are liable for
the costs incurred by the enforcement authority in processing the matter and
performing the work as provided by §
153.10 of this chapter.
   (B)   Bids may be solicited and accepted for work on more than one property
if the bid reflects an allocation of the bid amount among the various unsafe
premises in proportion to the work to be accomplished. The part of the bid
amount attributable to each of the unsafe premises constitutes the basis for
calculating the part of the costs described by §
153.10(A)(1) of this chapter.
   (C)   All persons who have a substantial property interest in the unsafe
premises, and are subject to an order other than an order under §

public bid in the manner prescribed by §
153.08 of this chapter, by means of a written statement including:

all persons having a fee interest, life estate interest, or equitable interest
of a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises;
      (6)   The time of the bid opening;
      (7)   The place of the bid opening; and
      (8)   The name, address, and business telephone number of the enforcement
authority.
   (D)   If the notice of the statement that public bids are to be let is
served by publication, the publication must include the information required by
division (C), except that it need only include a general description of the
work to be accomplished. The publication must also state that a copy of the
statement of public bid may be obtained from the enforcement authority.
   (E)   Notice of the statement that public bids are to be let must be given
at least ten days before the date of the public bid, to all persons who have a
substantial property interest in the property and are subject to an order other
than an order under §
153.05(A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4) of this chapter.
   (F)   If action is being taken under this section on the basis of an order
that was served by publication, it is sufficient to serve the statement that
public bids are to be let by publication, unless the enforcement authority has
received information in writing that enables the unit to make service under §
153.08 of this chapter by a method other than publication.

§ 155.005 INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to enable and qualify the implementation of
the following policies.
   (A)   The region.
      (1)   That the region should retain its natural infrastructure and visual
character derived from topography, woodlands, farmlands, riparian corridors and
natural water features.
      (2)   That growth strategies should encourage in fill and redevelopment
in parity with new communities.
      (3)   That development contiguous to urban areas should be structured in
the neighborhood pattern and be integrated with the existing urban pattern.
      (4)   That development non-contiguous to urban areas should be organized
in the pattern of clusters, traditional neighborhoods or towns, and commercial
villages.
      (5)   That affordable housing should be distributed throughout the region
to match job opportunities and to avoid concentrations of poverty.
      (6)   That transportation corridors should be planned and reserved in
coordination with land use.

urbanized areas.

and bicycle systems that provide alternatives to the automobile.
   (B)   The town.
      (1)   That neighborhoods and commercial villages should be compact,
pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use.
      (2)   That neighborhoods and regional centers should be the preferred
pattern of development and that districts specializing in single-use should be
the exception.
      (3)   That ordinary activities of daily living should occur within
walking distance of most dwellings, allowing independence to those who do not
drive.
      (4)   That interconnected networks of thoroughfares and pathways should
be designed to disperse and reduce the length of automobile trips.
      (5)   That within neighborhoods, a range of housing types and price
levels should be provided to accommodate diverse ages and incomes.
      (6)   That appropriate building densities and land uses should be
provided within walking distance of future transit stops.

or bicycle to them.

playgrounds should be distributed within neighborhoods and town center zones.
   (C)   The block and the building.
      (1)   That buildings and landscaping should contribute to the physical
definition of thoroughfares as civic/public places.
      (2)   That development should adequately accommodate automobiles while
respecting the pedestrian and the spatial form of public space.
      (3)   That the design of streets and buildings should reinforce safe
environments, but not at the expense of accessibility.
      (4)   That architecture and landscape design should grow from local
climate, topography, history, and building practice.
      (5)   That buildings should provide their inhabitants with a clear sense
of geography an climate through energy efficient methods.

locations that reinforce community identity and support self-government.

role more important than the other buildings that constitute the fabric of the
town.
      (8)   That the preservation and renewal of historic buildings should be
facilitated to affirm the continuity and evolution of society.
      (9)   That the harmonious and orderly evolution of urban areas should be
secured through graphic codes that serve as guides for change.

§ 155.042 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide greater design
flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan and intent of the zoning ordinance. The use of planned unit developments
shall be encouraged when such use promotes a harmonious variety of uses, and/or
provides for an economy of shared services and facilities, and/or are
compatible with surrounding areas and/or foster the creation of attractive,
healthful, efficient and stable environments for living, shopping or working.
      (2)   The Planned Unit Development District regulations and procedures
may apply to the redevelopment of presently developed lands, or the development
of open or vacant lands, and may apply to parcels of relatively small size as
well as large-scale developments and their relationship with other surrounding
uses and the overall characteristics of the area in which it is to be located.
      (3)   Planned Unit Development District regulations are intended to
encourage innovations in land development techniques so that the growing
demands of the community may be met with greater flexibility and type, design
and layout of sites and buildings and by the conservation and more efficient
use of open spaces and other amenities generally enhancing the quality of life.
      (4)   Planned Unit Development District projects should also encourage a
more efficient use of land, which reflects the changes in technology of land
development so that the resulting economies may accrue to the benefit of the
community at large.
      (5)   To that end, the regulations and development guidelines contained
in this chapter as to use, bulk, yards and height may be waived or modified to
provide relief therefrom to allow unconventional development in the specific
planned unit development project. The community may then benefit from such
desirable but unconventional developments and be protected and insured through
the limitations and conditions placed upon and made part of the ordinance
granting the specific planned unit development district.
   (B)   Classification. Planned unit developments may be classified in the
following designations:
      (1)   Planned Unit Development - Residential. Any development consisting
of not less than five acres in which more than 80% of the interior floor area
of all buildings to be included in the development is used for residential
purposes and/or those accessory purposes customarily related to residential
use.
      (2)   Planned Unit Development - Business. Any development consisting of
not less than five acres in which all of the interior floor area of all
buildings to be included in the development is to be used for business or
commercial purposes.
      (3)   Planned Unit Development - Industrial. Any development consisting
of not less than ten acres in which more than 80% of the interior floor area of
all buildings to be included in the development is used for industrial or
industrial purposes or such accessory uses customarily relating to industrial
or industrial uses, with balance of such interior floor area, if any, being
intended for such business or commercial uses as reasonably relate to the
support or convenience of the intended industrial or industrial uses or their
occupants.
      (4)   Planned Unit Development - Mobile Home Park. Any development
consisting of not less than 75 mobile home sites of not less than 4,500 square
feet each in which more than 80% of the interior floor area of all the mobile
homes and all the other buildings combined in the development is used for
mobile home residence or such accessory uses customarily related to mobile
homes, with the balance of such interior floor area, if any, being intended for
such business, commercial and community uses as reasonably relate to the
support or convenience of the mobile home park residents.
   (C)   Organization of proposals. Any person, corporation, partnership or
association having an ownership interest in a proposed development, or any
group of owners united in interest, acting jointly, and in pursuance to an
agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership may propose a planned
unit development district in accordance with the procedures hereinafter
established, where such individual owner or group of owners in making such
proposal intends to act as developer or sponsor of the development if the
planned unit development ordinance is adopted and indicates the requisite
capabilities to carry out such proposal. A parcel, or site proposed for a
planned unit development need not be under single ownership where the proposed
development consists of a group of structures or improvements capable of being
developed separately but in accordance with a single, unitary plan, and in
which the separate owners have given their expressed intentions to enter into
such private agreements between or among themselves as will facilitate their
mutual enterprise, and assure its completion as planned to the satisfaction of
the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Filing procedure. The general and specific procedures for filing for a
Planned Unit Development District are as set forth in the following:
      (1)   A petition and all other documents required for the requested
planned unit development district shall be submitted, which petition shall be
signed by the owner or owners of all real estate involved in the petition for
the planned unit development district, or which petition shall have attached
thereto the notarized consent of all such owners to the filing of such
petition.
      (2)   The PUD petition shall include preliminary plan and plat for any
area proposed for development. Sixteen copies of said plan and plat shall be
filed with the Plan Commission. The preliminary plan and plat shall include:
         (a)   The proposed layout of streets, open space and other basic
elements of the plan.
         (b)    Identification of location and types of structures and their
use categories within the area, including proposed densities of said uses.
         (c)   Proposals for handling traffic, parking, water supply, sewage
disposal, storm drainage, tree preservation and removal, landscaping, lighting,
signage and other pertinent development features.
         (d)   A separate location map to scale shall show the boundary line of
adjacent land and the existing zoning of the area proposed to be developed as
well as the adjacent land.
         (e)   The condominium declaration (if applicable), a document creating
an owners' association and any covenants which are to be made part of the
Planned Unit Development District as well as the order and estimated time of
development.
         (f)   A statement of the proposed order of development of the major
elements of the project, including whether the development will be accomplished
in phases, and, if so, the order and content of each phase.
         (g)   An environmental and/or community impact study, conducted by a
qualified individual, if required by the Plan Commission.
      (3)   The preliminary plan shall be presented to the Plan Commission at
the regularly scheduled meeting with copies for each member thereof and
additional file copies for a total of ten copies drawn to a scale ratio not to
exceed 100 feet =1 inch. The preliminary plan may include any additional
graphics, which will help to explain the features of the development. The Plan
Commission shall then schedule the preliminary plan for a public hearing, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable state law. The
preliminary plan shall also be provided to the following checkpoint agencies
for their review and comment:
         (a)   Lowell Dept. of Public Works;
         (b)   Lowell Police Department;
         (c)   Lowell Fire Department;
         (d)   Lowell Parks Department;
         (e)   Tri-Creek School Corporation;
         (f)   Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District.
      (4)   After assignment of a docket number and prior to the date of the
public hearing on the preliminary plan as established by the Plan Commission,
the Administrator shall meet with the petitioner regarding the preliminary plan
and checkpoint agency comments. Checkpoint agency personnel may attend this
meeting to provide additional comments and/or clarifications thereto. After
such consultation the petitioner may make modifications to the petition. The
Administrator may require revision to the preliminary plan if the modifications
are deemed to be substantive. Such revised preliminary plans shall be made
available to the members of the Plan Commission at least ten days prior to the
date of the public hearing thereon.
   (E)   Preliminary plan hearing. 
      (1)   The petition, if and as modified, shall be heard by the Plan
Commission as a petition under the planned unit development district provisions
of the zoning ordinance, and subject to the procedures applicable thereto. The
Plan Commission shall schedule and convene a public hearing on the proposed
development in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The Plan
Commission may recommend approval or disapproval of the plan and may impose any
reasonable condition(s) with its affirmative recommendation. If disapproval is
recommended, the application shall not be certified to the Town Council. If
approval is recommended, the preliminary plan shall be stamped "Approved
Preliminary Planned Unit Development" and be signed by the President and
Secretary of the Plan Commission. One copy shall be permanently retained in the
files of the Plan Commission, one copy shall be returned to the petitioner and
one copy and all conditions shall be certified as described below.
      (2)   The approved preliminary planned unit development shall then be
certified to the Town Council for adoption as a Planned Unit Development
District pursuant to the laws governing proposals to change zoning maps. Upon
adoption by the legislative body, the petitioner shall prepare the final
detailed plan.
   (F)   Approval of the final detailed plan. The procedures for approval of
the final detailed plan shall be as follows:
      (1)   After adoption of an ordinance by the Council to establish a
Planned Unit Development District and before any development takes place, the
petitioner shall file with the Plan Commission a minimum of six sets of the
final detailed plan specifying the location, composition and engineering
features of all restrictive covenants, condominium declaration and/or the
creation of a homeowners association, along with financial assurance for the
satisfactory installation of all public improvements in the form of bonds or
such other assurances as are required in the normal procedures of platting
pursuant to the provisions of §§
155.190 et seq., Subdivision Control Code. The Plan Commission shall then
approve said final detailed plans by duly adopted motion upon an affirmative
finding that the final detailed plan is consistent with the approved
preliminary planned unit development as adopted and passed by the Town Council
upon rezoning. Having so once approved the final detailed plan, the Plan
Commission shall have no further review or act thereon, except as to
enforcement, except as to an amendatory ordinance, and except as to hereafter
provided for.
      (2)   The approved preliminary planned unit development may provide for
the development of the property involved in phases. If such phasing is included
as a part of the approval of the preliminary plan, the petitioner may submit
partial final detailed plans, which correspond to the phases involved. Such
partial final detailed plans, when approved, shall be treated in the same
manner as approved final detailed plans for an entire planned unit development.
      (3)   The approved final detailed plan or phase thereof shall be stamped
"Approved Final Detailed Planned Unit Development" and be signed by the
President and Secretary of the Plan Commission with one copy permanently
retained in the files of the Plan Commission following recordation as specified
in division (H) below.
      (4)   Unless extended by the Plan Commission pursuant to division (K)
below, approval of the first phase of the final detailed plan shall be obtained
within 12 months of preliminary approval, and approval of the balance of the
final detailed plan shall be obtained within five years after adoption of the
Planned Unit Development District by the Town Council.
      (5)   In the event that approval of a final detailed plan is not obtained
within 12 months of initial application, the Plan Commission may initiate an
amendment to remove "Planned Unit Development District" designation and rezone
the property to another land use designation.
      (6)   Approval of a final detailed plan shall expire after a period of
five years from the approved phasing of the preliminary plan unless the
development is 50% completed in terms of public improvements including streets,
parks, walkways, utility installations and sanitary sewers. Determination of
the amount of completion shall be made by the Plan Commission upon a
recommendation of the Administrator. Following expiration of the final detailed
plan, the town shall declare the bond to be in default and cause all public
improvements to be installed according to the final detailed plan.
   (G)   Covenants and maintenance. The Plan Commission shall require and
accept covenants and restriction to the use of property in the planned unit
development as follows:
      (1)   All covenants required by the Plan Commission shall be set forth in
detail and provide for a provision for the release of such restriction by
execution of a document so stating and suitable for recording, signed by the
Plan Commission President and Secretary upon authorization by the Plan
Commission and all of the owners of property in the area involved in the
petition for whose benefit the covenant was created. Such covenants shall
provide that their benefits run to the Plan Commission and shall be
specifically enforceable by the Plan Commission in addition to the property
owners.
      (2)   The Plan Commission shall require the recording of such covenants
for any reasonable public or semi-public purpose, including but not limited to,
the allocation of land by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks,
schools, recreational facilities, and other cited pubic and semi-public
purposes. Such covenants shall provide that if a governmental unit or agency
thereof does not proceed with acquisition of the allocated land within a
specific period of time, the covenants shall automatically terminate. If such
termination does occur, the petitioners shall then submit for approval by the
Plan Commission a modified final detailed plan for such land, otherwise
consistent with the approved preliminary planned unit development.
      (3)   The Plan Commission shall require the recording of covenants for
any other reasonable purpose, including but not limited to, imposing standards
for the development of property in a planned unit development. Such development
standards may include, but are not limited to, requirements as to the
following:

line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such center lines.

adopted, the district in which the majority of the area of the property is
included shall apply to the entire property. In cases where a property is
divided equally between two or more zoning districts, the most restrictive
district shall apply to the entire property. The Planning Director or the
official designee shall determine the applicable zoning for properties divided
into several zoning districts consistent with this section.
   (F)   If the Planning Director cannot definitely determine the location of a
district boundary by such center lines, by scale or dimensions stated on the
official zoning map, or by the fact that it does not clearly coincide with a

Plan Commission shall interpret the location of the district boundary with
reference to the scale of the official zoning map and the purposes set forth in
all relevant provisions of this chapter.

§ 155.077 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The performance standards apply to the following districts: B1, B2, LI, HI,
PB. All uses placed into operation after the effective date of this chapter
should comply with the following general performance standards in the interests
of protecting public health, safety, and general welfare and lessening damage
to property. No use on a property should exhibit obnoxious characteristics to
the extent that it constitutes a public nuisance or interferes with reasonable
enjoyment of neighboring properties. No use in existence on the effective date
of this chapter should be altered or modified to conflict with these standards.
The "Right to Farm" laws may supersede these guidelines as they pertain to
farming and agricultural uses.
   (A)   Air pollution. No use on a property should release fly ash, dust,
smoke, vapors, noxious, toxic or corrosive matter or other air pollutants in
such concentration as to be detrimental to health, animals, vegetation or
property, or conflict with public air quality standards.
   (B)   Electrical disturbance. No use on a property should cause electrical
disturbance adversely affecting radio, television or other equipment in the
vicinity.
   (C)   Fire protection. Fire fighting equipment and prevention measures
acceptable to the local Fire Departments should be readily available and
apparent when any activity involving the handing and storage of flammable or
explosive materials is conducted.
   (D)   Noise. No use on a property should produce noise in such a manner as
to be objectionable because of volume, frequency, intermittence, beat,
shrillness, or vibration. Such noise should be muffled or otherwise controlled
so as not to become detrimental. Public safety sirens and related apparatus
used solely for public purposes shall be exempt from this standard.
   (E)   Odor. No use on a property should emit across lot lines any gas or
matter with a bad odor in such quantity as to be readily detectable at any
point along such lines.
   (F)   Vibration. No use on a property should cause vibrations detectable
beyond lot lines without the aid of instruments.
   (G)   Heat and glare. No use on a property should produce heat and glare in
such a manner as to create a hazard to neighboring property. No such heat or
glare interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property, or the
safety of transportation routes.
   (H)   Waste matter. No use on a property should accumulate within the lot or
discharge waste matter beyond the lot lines.
   (I)   Water pollution. No use on a property should produce erosion or other
pollutants in such a quantity as to be detrimental to adjacent properties or to
conflict with public water quality standards.
   (J)   Traffic. No use on a property should cause excessive vehicular traffic
on adjoining roads.
   (K)   Visual character. No use on a property should adversely impact the
general visual or aesthetic character of the neighboring properties or disrupt
the general or aesthetic character of the area.

§ 155.078 ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
   The environmental standards apply to the following districts: AG, R1, R2,
R3, R4, MH, PB, B1, B2, TC, LI, HI. The following standards pertain to
environmental concerns in the town. Some of the following standards refer to
state regulations. This is not to imply that the town is enforcing state
regulations; state regulations are referred to in order to make the affected
property owners aware that they exist and need to be complied with in addition
to local law.
   (A)   Land suitability. No land shall be used, or structure erected where
the land is unsuitable for such use or structure due to slopes greater than
10%, adverse soil or rock formation, erosion susceptibility, low percolation
rate or bearing strength, or any other feature as determined by the Planning
Director, Town Engineer, or County Health Department likely to be harmful to
the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the
community.
   (B)   Preservation of natural/historic features. Existing natural and
historic features which would add value to the development of the town such as
trees, streams, vistas, lakes, historical landmarks, and similar irreplaceable
assets, when possible, should be preserved through harmonious and careful
design. Land to be developed shall be designed and improved as far as practical
in conformity to existing topography in order to minimize storm water runoff,
and conserve the natural cover and soil.
   (C)   Landscaping. Any part or portion of a non-farm parcel which is not
used for structures, loading or parking spaces, sidewalks and accessory uses
shall be landscaped or left in a natural state. If landscaped, it shall be
planted with an all season ground cover and shall be landscaped with trees and
shrubs in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and shall be in
keeping with natural surroundings.
   (D)   Cut/fill grade. No cut or fill grade shall exceed a slope of 4/1 or
25%. This provision shall apply to all cuts and fills exceeding 100 square feet
in exposed surface area, including cuts or fills on land naturally exceeding 3/
1 in slope.
   (E)   Treatment of fill. Material used for fill where permitted by this
chapter and/or by the IDEM, IDNR, or other governmental agency, shall be
promptly covered and seeded.
   (F)   Erosion prevention. All land, regardless of slope, from which
structures or natural cover has been removed or otherwise destroyed, shall be
appropriately graded and seeded within a reasonable time frame after the
removal or destruction of said natural cover, not to exceed 60 days, to prevent
erosion.
   (G)   Surface water. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot
or parcel of land developed for any use other than for agriculture to provide
for adequate surface water drainage. Existing natural surface drainage should
be utilized. Whenever the evidence available indicates that the natural surface
drainage is inadequate, the owner shall provide the parcel with an adequate
surface water drainage system which shall be integrated into the drainage
pattern of surrounding properties. Swales are required to be placed in an
easement to prohibit future filling or constructing. On-site detention for a
100-year storm event shall be required unless a written statement by a licensed
engineer indicates that it is not necessary to prevent harm to adjoining
properties. All drainage plans are subject to review and approval by the Town
Engineer.
   (H)   Drainage. Drainage swales (ditches) along dedicated roadways and
within the right-of-way or on dedicated drainage easements are not to be
altered, except for maintenance as originally constructed and as approved by
the town or the Indiana Department of Transportation. Driveways may be
constructed over these swales as permitted by the appropriate agency.
   (I)   Regulated drain setbacks. No permanent structures other than a fence
may be erected, and if erected in violation of this section, no such structure
may be used if its location is within 75 feet of the center line of any
regulated tile ditch, or within 75 feet of the existing top of bank of any
regulated open ditch or tile unless approved by the Town Engineer and Lake
County Drainage Board.
   (J)   Projects affecting regulated drains. Regulated drains are under the
jurisdiction of the Lake County Drainage Board. The Lake County Drainage Board
or Town Engineer shall review and approve all development or projects directly
affecting a regulated open ditch or tile per IC 36-9-27.
   (K)   Alterations to bodies of water. No alteration of the shoreline or bed
of a river, wetland, or public lake shall be made until appropriate written
approval is obtained from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and Army
Corps of Engineers, the Indiana Department of Environmental management; and the
provisions of this chapter are complied with.
   (L)   Retention, detention, and pond edges. All retention, detention, and
pond edges must be maintained with a buffer of natural plantings within 20 feet
of the peak elevation. The use of "rip-rap" or any other engineered hard edges
shall not exceed 5% of lineal feet of the total edge of any retention facility,
detention facility, or pond.
   (M)   Code compliance/hazardous waste. All development must be in compliance
with IC Title 13, as amended, as it relates to hazardous waste, low level
nuclear waste, underground storage tanks, waste tires, and other applicable
chapters of IC Title 13.
   (N)   Code compliance/environmental quality. All development must be in
compliance with IC Title 13, as amended, as it relates to air pollution
control, water pollution control, solid waste management, and other applicable
chapters of IC Title 13.
   (O)   Waste/debris. No waste materials such as garbage, rubbish, household
appliances, inoperable vehicles, furniture designed for interior use, gasoline,
oil, flammables, soils, tars, chemicals, greases, dead plant material, noxious
weeds, industrial or agricultural waste, or any other material of such nature,
quantity, obnoxiousness, toxicity, or temperature so as to contaminate,
pollute, or harm water bodies or ground water, provide a habitat for disease
carrying animals and insects, or represent a public safety hazard shall be
deposited, located, stored, or discharged outside on any lot; nor shall such
waste be allowed to accumulate within structures in a manner that is
inconsistent with applicable regulations for the storage of such materials.
   (P)   Fuel storage. No highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or
gasses specified by the State Fire Marshal shall be stored except in accordance
with the rules established by the State Fire Marshal.

   (A)   These telecommunication facility standards apply to the following
districts: AG, R1, R2. R3, R4, MH, PB, B1, B2, TC, LI and HI. The purpose of
this section is to allow for the provision of adequate reliable public and
private telecommunication service and to maximize the use of any transmission
tower and tower site in order to reduce the total number of towers and
locations needed to serve the telecommunications needs of the area; to minimize
adverse, undesirable visual effects of towers through careful design, siting,
and vegetative screening. All wireless telecommunication facilities shall meet
the following provisions:
      (1)   Required approvals. The placement of telecommunications facilities
shall meet the following approval requirements as detailed in this section:
         (a)   The installation of new antenna on existing towers, including
legal non-conforming towers, and existing alternative structures (such as water
towers, buildings, or church steeples) may be approved by the Planning Director
subject to conformance with all applicable requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   The installation of new accessory structures to support the
installation of antenna on existing towers or alternative structures may be
approved by the Planning Director subject to conformance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   The installation of new towers shall be approved either by the
Planning Director as a permitted use or by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a
special use consistent with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Determination of tower need. Any proposal for a new
telecommunications tower shall only be approved if the applicant submits
verification that the antennas planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on any existing or approved towers or structures within a three-
mile radius of the proposed tower location due to one or more of the following
reasons:
         (a)   The antennas would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or structure as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved
tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate the antennas at a reasonable cost.
         (b)   The antennas would cause interference impacting the usability of
other existing or planned equipment at the tower site. Supportive documentation
by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating that the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost must be provided.
         (c)   The existing or approved towers or structures within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional
engineer.
         (d)   Other unforeseen reasons make it unfeasible or impossible to
locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved
tower or structure as certified and documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer.
         (e)   The owner or operator of the antenna is unable to enter a
commonly reasonable lease term with the existing tower owner or land owner.
         (f)   Additional land area is not available.
      (3)   Design requirements. All telecommunications facilities shall meet
the following design requirements:
         (a)   Towers and antennas should generally be designed to blend into

architectural treatment, except in an instance where the color is dictated by
federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.
         (b)   Wireless telecommunication service towers less than 131 feet
tall should generally be of a monopole design and, when located within or
adjacent to an environmentally, aesthetically sensitive area or a residential
district, designed in such a way as to architecturally camouflage the wireless
telecommunication service tower as much as reasonably practical to blend into
the surroundings.
         (c)   The use of contextually compatible materials such as wood,
brick, or stucco is required for associated support structures, which shall be
designed to architecturally match the exterior of any adjacent residential or
commercial structures within the neighborhood or area. Only if the facility
will be 100% screened, as determined by the Planning Director, during all
seasons may other materials be used.
         (d)   Only when lighting is for safety or security reasons or required
by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority will
it be permitted. All ground level security lighting shall be oriented inward so
as not to project onto surrounding properties, and shall have 90 degree cut-off
luminaries (shielded downlighting).
         (e)   Any proposed telecommunication tower shall be designed, and
engineered structurally, electrically and in all other respects to accommodate
both the applicant's equipment and at least one additional user for every 50
feet in total tower height in excess of 75 feet.
            1.   Each additional user shall be assumed to have an antenna
loading equal to that of the initial user.
            2.   Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of
antennas upon the tower and accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
         (f)   No tower, including an attached antenna, shall exceed 199 feet
in height. No accessory structure shall exceed 15 feet in height.
      (4)   Site requirements. All telecommunications facilities shall meet the
following site requirements:
         (a)   All telecommunications facilities shall be fully automated and
unattended on a daily basis, and shall be visited only for periodic maintenance
and emergencies.
         (b)   Vehicular access to the tower and equipment building shall,
whenever feasible, be provided along existing driveways.
         (c)   The lot where the tower is located (or lease area) shall be
large enough to accommodate all future anticipated accessory structures needed
by future antenna users. The size of the site shall also be of sufficient area
to allow the location of two additional towers and associated support
facilities. At a minimum, the width and depth of the tower site shall be 50
feet greater than a distance equal to the tower height.
         (d)   No part of any wireless telecommunications facility nor any
lines, cables, equipment or wires or braces in connection with either shall at
any time extend across or over any part of the right-of-way, public street,
highway, sidewalk, or property line.
         (e)   An eight-foot high security fence shall completely surround the
tower and equipment building site. An area ten feet in width may remain outside
of the fence for the purpose of providing the landscape screening described in
division (4)(f) below.
         (f)   Evergreen buffer plantings shall be located around the outermost
perimeter of the security fence of all wireless telecommunications facilities,
including any guy wires and anchors.
            1.   If evergreen hedges are used they shall be a minimum of five
feet tall at the time of planting and planted a maximum of three feet on
center.
            2.   If evergreen trees are used they shall be a minimum of six
feet tall at the time of planting and planted a maximum of ten feet on center.
            3.   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to
the maximum extent possible.
      (5)   Construction requirements. All antennas, tower and accessory
structures constructed within the town jurisdiction, shall comply with the
following construction requirements:
         (a)   All applicable provisions of the Building Code of the State of
Indiana and the Federal Communications Commission.
         (b)   Towers shall be certified by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer to conform to the latest structural standards and wind
loading requirements of the Indiana Building Code.
         (c)   Towers and antennas shall be designed to conform with accepted
electrical engineering methods and practices and to comply with the provisions
of the National Electrical Code.
         (d)   Towers shall be constructed to conform with the requirements of
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
         (e)   An engineer's certification shall be submitted to document and
verify the design specifications including but not limited to, the foundation
for the tower, anchors for the guy wires if used, co-location, and strength
requirements for natural forces; ice, wind, earth movements, etc.
         (f)   All signal and remote control conductors of low energy extending
substantially horizontally above the ground between a tower, antenna and a
structure, or between towers, shall be at least ten feet above the ground at
all points, unless buried underground.
         (g)   Towers and antennas shall be designed and constructed, at a
minimum, to withstand wind gusts of at least 80 miles per hour with one-half
inch of ice, also accommodating any co-location requirements.
      (6)   Existing facilities. The following shall apply to existing antennas
and towers:
         (a)   Existing towers may continue in use for their current purpose
but may not be replaced or structurally altered without complying in all
respects to the requirements in this chapter.
         (b)   Any request submitted to the Plan Commission to install an
antenna to be located on an existing approved or grandfathered tower will only
require an improvement location permit and a copy of the contract between the
applicant company and the owner of the tower.
         (c)   If such towers are damaged or destroyed due to any reason or
cause whatsoever, the tower may be repaired and restored to its former
location, and physical dimensions upon obtaining an improvement location
permit. However, if the cost of repairing the tower to the former use, physical
dimensions, and location would be 10% more than the cost of a new tower of like
kind and quality, then the tower may not be repaired or restored except in full
compliance with all requirements in this chapter.
      (7)   Inspection. All towers may be inspected periodically by an official
of the town and/or a qualified and licensed engineer to determine compliance
with the original construction standards. Deviation from original construction
for which a permit is obtained constitutes a violation of this chapter.
      (8)   Removal. Any tower unused or left abandoned for 12 consecutive
months shall be removed by the tower owner at its expense. At the time an
improvement location permit is received for the construction of any tower or
antenna, both the property owner and tower owner shall provide a bond meeting
the requirements of the town in an amount and duration necessary to ensure the
tower's and/or antenna's removal.
   (B)   These telecommunication facility standards apply to the following

§ 155.094 STREETSCAPE STANDARDS.
   These streetscape standards apply to the following districts: AG, R1, R2,
R3, R4, MH, PB, B1, B2, TC, LI and HI.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. These streetscape requirements are meant to ensure
the construction of a continuous, pedestrian friendly, network of streets which
disperse traffic flow over as many routes as possible. The requirements are
meant to prevent the arterialization of existing streets and to ensure that new
development does not unduly impose costs on existing residents in the form of
congestion or expensive street improvements, such as road widenings.
   (B)   General.
      (1)   The thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular and pedestrian
traffic and to provide access to lots and open spaces.
      (2)   The thoroughfares consist of vehicular lanes and public frontages.
The lanes provide the traffic and parking capacity. They consist of vehicular
lanes in a variety of widths for parked and for moving
vehicles. The frontages contribute to the character of the zone or district.
They include the types of sidewalk, curbing, planter, and street tree.
      (3)   Thoroughfares should be designed in context with the form
guidelines and desired design speed of the zones and districts through which
they pass. Thoroughfares that pass from one zone or district to another shall
adjust their public frontages accordingly or, alternatively, the zone or
district may follow the alignment of the thoroughfare to the depth of one lot,
retaining a single public frontage throughout its trajectory.
      (4)   Within the more rural zone or district, pedestrian comfort shall be
a secondary consideration of the thoroughfare. Design conflict between
vehicular and pedestrian movement shall be generally decided in favor of
vehicular mobility.
      (5)   Within the more urban zone or district, pedestrian comfort shall be
a primary consideration of the thoroughfare. Design conflict between vehicular
and pedestrian movement shall be decided in favor of the pedestrian.
   (C)   Thoroughfares.
      (1)   The standards for vehicular lanes shall be as shown in the
appropriate development guidelines.
      (2)   Thoroughfares shall connect to existing T intersections adjacent to
properties being developed.
      (3)   Thoroughfares shall connect to existing stub roads adjacent to
properties being developed.
      (4)   Blocks shall conform to the standards prescribed in the appropriate
development guidelines. The size of blocks shall be measured as the perimeter
of the outside curb face. Exceptions shall be made when inhibited by natural
features, or existing conditions. In cases of exception, the shortest, most
logical block size shall be made.
      (5)   T Intersections shall be prohibited except when terminating at
major public buildings, public open spaces, or when inhibited by existing
conditions or natural features.
      (6)   Blocks shall be sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth.
      (7)   Stub roads shall be constructed at edges of property in order to
create future through streets.
      (8)   Cul-de-sacs shall be designed to prevent their length from
exceeding 300 feet. Dead end streets, excluding stub roads, shall be prohibited
except when inhibited by natural features.
      (9)   New road layouts shall not prevent adjacent properties from being
able to meet the above stated thoroughfare standards or zoning standards.

NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, LOTS AND USES
§ 155.120 INTENT.
   Upon adoption of this chapter and official zoning map, some structures,
lots, and uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district
in which they are located. For this reason, this subchapter has been generated
to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these structures,
lots, and uses; referred to as legal nonconforming.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.121 DISTINCTION BETWEEN ILLEGAL NONCONFORMING AND LEGAL NONCONFORMING.
   (A)   A structure or lot which was constructed or is being used without an
approved improvement location permit or approval from the Board of Zoning
Appeals or Plan Commission is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal
nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by
this chapter and all other applicable town ordinances and shall be altered to
conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   Legal nonconforming differs from illegal nonconforming in that the
reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a zoning code or a
change to the zoning code (including the official zoning map). The structure,
lot or use has not changed, but due to the zoning code enactment or change, the
property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the zoning
district in which it is located. When this situation occurs, the property is
deemed legal nonconforming or grandfathered.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.122 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Any sign, lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the developmental
standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign. For the purposes of this
subchapter, a sign shall include the sign face and any supports, poles, or
frames.
   (B)   A legal nonconforming sign may continue provided that it remains the
same or fits within the below described tolerances:
      (1)   Any legal nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged or altered in
terms of face area, height, or any other aspect that increases its
nonconformity. However, any sign or portion thereof may be altered to decrease
its nonconformity.
      (2)   Any legal nonconforming sign which is intentionally altered to
conform to the requirements of this chapter shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming
features may not be resumed.
      (3)   If a sign is moved or removed for any reason, for any distance, it
shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The sign faces and/or message on a legal nonconforming sign may be
altered, replaced, repainted, and repaired provided that the nonconformity of
the sign is not increased. Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted as
requiring a sign to be brought into conformance with this chapter if only the
face is changed, but not increased in size or altered in shape.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.123 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any structure, lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the developmental
standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure. A legal
nonconforming structure may continue provided that it remains the same or fits
within the below described tolerances:
   (A)   Any legal nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in
a manner that increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof
may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (B)   Any legal nonconforming structure which is intentionally altered to
conform to the requirements of this chapter shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming
features may not be resumed.
   (C)   If a building or structure is moved for any reason, for any distance,
it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.124 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   All lots legally established and recorded prior to the effective date of
this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet any applicable
provision of this chapter shall be deemed a legal nonconforming lot of record.
Legal nonconforming lots of record may be built upon only if the proposed use
is permitted and all development standards of the applicable zoning district of
this chapter are met. Any lot which met minimum lot standard area at the time
it was created, shall be deemed buildable for a single- family residence.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.125 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES, LAND OR STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   Any lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination
established prior to the effective date of this chapter or its subsequent
amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is
located shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. A legal nonconforming use
may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following conditions:
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a legal nonconforming use shall be
enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered except as to change the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located or as otherwise specified in
this subchapter.
   (B)   No structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal
nonconforming use of land.
   (C)   Any legal nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout
any parts of a building which were plainly arranged or designed for such use at
the effective date of this chapter or its subsequent amendments, but no such
use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
   (D)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use may be
changed to another nonconforming use with the approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals if the Board shall find that the proposed use is equally or more
appropriate to the district in which it is located than the existing use. The
Board shall consider the development standards applicable to the proposed use
established by this chapter and may make reasonable conditions as part of any
approval.
   (E)   Where legal nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land
in combination, the intentional removal of the structure shall eliminate the
legal nonconforming status of the land.
   (F)   No legal nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased,
extended to occupy a greater area of land, or moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of a lot than was occupied at the effective date of this chapter.
   (G)   If a legal nonconforming use is intentionally discontinued for one
year or longer, any subsequent use of such land, structure or land and
structure shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. Uses which are
required to be discontinued due to government action which impedes access to
the premises, or damage resulting from fire, flood, other natural disaster, or
a criminal act shall be exempt from this provision. Such exempt uses, if
rebuilt or restored, shall be identical in scale, lot coverage, and all other
aspects to that which was discontinued.
   (H)   When a legal nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located, the legal nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (I)   Any use which is legal nonconforming due to its presence in a 100-year
floodplain may be altered, enlarged, or extended on a one-time only basis
provided that the new construction conforms with §
155.079 and does not increase the value of the structure or use (excluding the
value of the land) by more than 50% of its pre improvement market value.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-11-13)
§ 155.126 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   The following applies to legal nonconforming structures and legal
nonconforming uses of structures, or structures and land in combination:
   (A)   Work may be done for ordinary repairs or replacement of walls,
heating, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing; under the condition that the cubic
content existing when the structure became nonconforming shall not be
increased.
   (B)   If a structure becomes unsafe or unlawful due to physical condition
and is razed, the structure shall be rebuilt in conformity with the district in
which it is located.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening,
repairing, or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety
upon order of such official.

are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirement of these regulations, and such private provisions are not
inconsistent with these regulations, then such private provisions shall be
supplemental to these regulations. (Note: Private provisions can only be
enforced privately, unless a public agency has been made party to such
agreements.)
   (L)   Saving provision. This subchapter shall not be construed as
eliminating or reducing any action now pending under, or by virtue of, an

the time of the inspection.
         (b)   In the event that the Planning Director is denied entry to any

Development Code or Comprehensive Plan.

§ 155.192 ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of the administrative subdivision process is to
allow a simplified procedure for the creation of low-density development of
rural lands consistent with the agricultural characteristics of areas of the
town.
   (B)   Minimum standards for an administrative subdivision.
      (1)   Parcel zoning and density standards: Administrative subdivisions
shall be permitted in the following zoning districts as established by the Land
Use and Development Code:
         (a)   Parent tract defined. The subdivision approval shall be based on
the characteristics of the parent tract legally established and recorded prior
to December 31, 2000. For the purposes of this section, any two or more lots
which shared a common property line at any point and were under the same
ownership prior to December 31, 2000 shall be considered as one parent tract.
         (b)   Subdivisions permitted. In all zoning districts the creation of
additional lots shall be based on a sliding scale determined by the acreage
present in the parent tract as defined in division (B)(1) above. The sliding
scale shall be as follows:
            1.   Parent tracts which include between four and ten acres shall
be permitted to be divided for the creation of one additional lot (for a total
of two lots including the remainder from the parent tract).
            2.   Parent tracts which include 10 to 15 acres shall be permitted
to be divided for the creation of two additional lots (for a total of three
lots including the remainder from the parent tract).
            3.   Parent tracts which include 15 acres or more shall be
permitted to be divided for the creation of three additional lots (for a total
of four lots including the remainder from the parent tract).
            4.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as permitting the
creation of additional lots from parent tracts present on January 1, 2000 that
have subsequently been divided, through a "mini plat" or other means, to the
extent that a number of new lots greater than that specified above will be
created.
         (c)   Exception. A habitable residence, as determined by the Planning
Director, built prior to December 31, 2000, located in any zoning district may
be separated from the parent tract through the administrative subdivision
process provided that both the lot and the remaining tract conform with all
requirements of the Land Use and Development Code for the zoning district in
which the property is located. Such exception shall also be required to conform
with all design standards provided by this section.
         (d)   Subdivision rights. All subdivision rights as established by
this section shall run with the parent tract or remainder thereof. The further
subdivision of any lot created from a parent tract shall be prohibited unless
it is consistent with the major subdivision process established by §
155.193.
         (e)   Further subdivision. Once all of the permitted lots have been
split from the parent tract, any further subdivisions shall follow the major
subdivision process established by §
155.193 in order for the town to ensure that land is improved in coordination
with the Comprehensive Plan in the laying out of public ways, easements,
structures, utilities, and other features; that regional drainage concerns are
addressed; and established public policy is followed.
      (2)   All administrative subdivisions shall conform to the following
design standards:
         (a)   Any subdivision which includes the construction of any public
improvements including a public street, sidewalks, sewer or water mains, or
street trees shall be considered a major subdivision and follow the major
subdivision process established by §
155.193.
         (b)   All lots and any remaining tract shall be consistent with all
applicable requirements of the Land Use and Development Code, including lot
size, setbacks, frontage on a public road, width to depth ratio, and lot width.
         (c)   At the time of filing, the property owner shall be required to
show all possible lots which are permitted to be created through the
administrative subdivision provisions of this subchapter on a rural development
concept plan, including the exception described by division (B)(1)(c) above.
         (d)   All road cuts shall be subject to the review of the Town
Council.
            1.   No private driveway shall be permitted which provides the only
means of access to more than three lots. Any common access drive shared by more
than three lots must be created in the form of a public road. If such a public
road is required, the development shall be considered a major subdivision and
shall follow the major subdivision process established by §
155.193.
            2.   Lot frontage on private common drives may be considered as
meeting the road frontage requirements of the Land Use and Development Code.
            3.   All driveways shall be designed to prevent vehicles from being
required to back onto the public road.
         (e)   All driveways shall be a minimum of 16 feet in width, with
common portions included in a minimum 30-foot wide access easement.
         (f)   All driveways shall be constructed consistent with the
requirements of the Town Engineer.
         (g)   A permanent documentation of any shared driveway agreement must
be signed by all involved property owners or take the form of covenants on all
applicable property. The documentation shall include, but is not limited to
maintenance, snow removal, ownership, and liability. The documentation shall
specifically exempt the town from any responsibility regarding the maintenance
and upkeep of the shared driveway. The agreement shall be reviewed and approved
by the Planning Director. The agreement shall be recorded in the office of the
County Recorder. A copy of the agreement shall be kept in the office of the
Plan Commission.
         (h)   Dry fire hydrants shall be installed in existing ponds and other
bodies of water located on property included in the administrative subdivision
consistent with the desires of the local fire department having jurisdiction.
         (i)   Necessary and adequate utilities and drainage facilities shall
exist on the site. All septic systems and wells shall be subject to the
approval of the County Health Department. A drainage plan for each subdivision
shall be reviewed and approved by the Town Engineer consistent with IC 36-9-27-
69.5.
         (j)   The applicant shall dedicate right-of-way along all public road
frontages, including those of any new lots and the remainder of the parent
tract, consistent with required right-of-way widths established by §
155.195.
         (k)   Adequate ingress and egress to the remainder of the parent tract
and adjacent properties must be maintained, planned for and provided.

section and with all fees required.
      (5)   After obtaining primary plat approval, the applicant shall file for
final plat approval pursuant to §
155.193(J)(1). The application for final plat approval shall be submitted to
the Technical Review Committee for review. It shall be consistent with the
approved Primary Plat and the requirements of this subchapter and any other
applicable improvement standards and processes. The Committee shall approve the
final plat if all the required materials provided are consistent with this
subchapter. The Planning Director shall then sign the final plat on behalf of
the Plan Commission and provide it to the applicant for recording with the
County Recorder. Approval of the final plat shall be effective for a maximum
period of one year from the date of approval, unless it is signed and recorded
as required by this subchapter.
      (6)   Waivers. The Plan Commission shall have the sole authority to grant
waivers of the requirements of this subchapter.

§ 155.194 SURETY.
   (A)   At the time when the final plat approval request is provided to the
Planning Director and before the plat is certified by the President and
Secretary of the Plan Commission, the petitioner shall provide appropriate
performance and/or maintenance bonds or irrevocable letters of credit as surety
for the public improvements in the subdivision.
   (B)   For plats which have been divided into sections for the purpose of a
phased development, surety shall only be required to be provided for the public
improvements included in the section which is the subject of the final plat
approval request. This provision shall not be interpreted as relieving the
subdivider of surety requirements for public improvements in previously
recorded or future sections, which were/shall be required at the time of their
respective final plat approval.
      (3)   The surety shall be in a format and amount consistent with the
requirements of this section, including the following requirements:
         (a)   The surety shall be drawn in favor of the "Town of Lowell."
         (b)   The surety shall be in an amount and time period determined by
the Town Engineer, sufficient to adequately maintain completed improvements and
to install yet incomplete improvements in compliance with this subchapter. The
petitioner's engineer or contractor shall supply an estimate of the cost of the
improvements and their installation to aid the Town Engineer in the
determination of the amount of the bond. The petitioner's estimate, however,
shall not be binding. All surety shall be kept in the office of the Town Clerk-
Treasurer.
         (c)   The surety shall specifically list the name of the subdivision
and section, if applicable, to which it applies, the date from which it is
valid, the time period for which it is valid, the public improvements to which
it applies, and whether it is maintenance or performance surety. The surety
shall further comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory
to the Town Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set
forth in these regulations.
         (d)   Maintenance surety shall be provided in an amount equal to 25%
of the cost of the public improvements and their installation and shall be
provided for a period of two years from the date the improvements are accepted
by the Town Council.
         (e)   Performance surety shall be provided in an amount equal to 125%
of the cost of the yet incomplete public improvements and their installation
and shall be provided for a time period sufficient to ensure the installation
for the improvements.
            1.    Performance surety shall be provided for sidewalks, street
trees, erosion control, and the street surface which are generally not complete
at the time of final plat acceptance, subject to the provisions for the
installation of such improvements provided by this subchapter.
            2.    Performance surety shall be also be provided for any other
public improvements which are incomplete in total or in part at the time of
final plat acceptance. The acceptance of performance surety rather than
complete improvements in the case of items other than sidewalks, street trees,
erosion control, and the street surface shall be considered by the Town
Council, upon the recommendation of the Town Engineer and Planning Director,
based on the following considerations:
               a.    Whether or not the failure to complete the public
improvements was the result of a situation specific to the physical conditions
or unique design requirements of the subdivision or a natural event beyond the
control of the subdivider.
               b.    Whether or not the incomplete improvements would
negatively affect public safety, health or welfare.
               c.    Whether or not the incomplete improvements would
negatively affect property values or pose a hazard to adjacent property, or
structures to be completed in the development prior to the completion of the
improvements.
               d.    Whether or not the subdivider is able to complete the
public improvements in a satisfactory and timely manner.
            3.   In no case may the initial time period for the performance
surety for these improvements exceed two years. The Town Council may, upon
review and advice of the Planning Director and Town Engineer, extend the time
period allowed for the completion of improvements and the validity of the
performance surety.
         (f)   Either maintenance or performance surety shall be provided for
all public improvements, including but not limited to, street compaction,
subsurface, base, and surface; sanitary sewers; curbs; gutters; sidewalks;
surface swales; subsurface and storm drainage systems; seeding/erosion control;
landscaping; and any other public improvements required by the Plan Commission
or other appropriate public agency through the preliminary plat and
construction plan review and approval process.
         (g)   A developer may request permission of the Town Council to delay
the installation of the one-inch surface layer of asphalt until the binder
layer of asphalt has had a sufficient time period to prove its durability under
the stress of heavy construction traffic. The developer shall be required to
submit a separate performance bond to cover the cost of the installation of the
one inch surface layer of asphalt.
   (B)   Release of performance surety.
      (1)   Upon completion of the public improvements for which performance
surety has been provided, the subdivider shall make a written request to the
Town Council for the release of the surety. The request shall include the
following:
         (a)   A description of the public improvements which have been
completed;
         (b)   A report from the subdivider's engineer certifying that the
improvements were completed consistent with all applicable requirements and
standards; and
         (c)   Maintenance surety for the public improvements consistent with
the requirements of this section.
      (2)   The Planning Director and Town Engineer shall provide appropriate
inspections of the public improvements and the matter shall be placed on the
agenda for the appropriate meeting of the Town Council.
      (3)   Before any performance surety covering a street installation is
released, the Planning Director, Town Council, or Town Engineer may request
that core borings of the street be done at the subdivider's expense. Cores
shall be reviewed by an independent testing laboratory or registered engineer
for analysis.
      (4)   If the Planning Director and Town Engineer report that the public
improvements were completed consistent with all applicable standards and
appropriate maintenance surety is provided, the Town Council shall release the
performance surety and accept the public improvements.
      (5)   If the Planning Director and/or Town Engineer report that the
public improvements have not been competed in a satisfactory manner then the
Town Council may deny the request for the release of the performance surety,
providing a written statement of denial to the subdivider which includes a
detailed list of required corrections. The petitioner shall make the required
corrections and reapply for the release of the surety.
      (6)   In reviewing requests for the release of performance surety, the
Planning Director, Town Engineer, and Town Council shall consider the
following:
         (a)   Whether or not the improvements were completed in a manner
consistent with the approved preliminary plat, approved construction plans, and
all applicable standards and requirements;
         (b)   Whether or not the report provided by the subdivider's engineer
is complete and satisfactory; and
         (c)   Whether or not the public improvements are in good condition and
appropriate for use by the public.
            1.   All streets and sidewalks shall be clear of all dirt, debris,
standing water, and construction equipment and/or supplies.
            2.   All drainage structures shall be clear of sedimentation,
debris, or other obstructions and be adequately secured to prevent access by
the public.
            3.   All erosion control measures shall be consistent with
applicable standards for the limiting of erosion and sedimentation.
            4.   The areas adjacent to all sidewalks shall be graded and
seeded.
            5.   All street trees shall be healthy and the planting area shall
be graded.
      (7)   In any case where the required public improvements have not been
completed two months prior to the date the performance surety will expire and
the Town Council and the subdivider are unable to reach agreement on an
extension of the time frame for the surety and the completion of the public
improvements, the Council may declare the surety to be in default. The required
public improvements may then be installed by the town, using the funds from the
surety.
   (C)   Release of maintenance surety.
      (1)   The subdivider shall be required to ensure that the public
improvements covered by the maintenance surety remain free of construction
related defects for the term of the surety.
         (a)   The public improvements shall be subject to periodic inspection
by the town. Written notice shall be provided to the subdivider of any defects
that are detected and any corrections that are required. The subdivider shall
make the necessary corrections consistent with all applicable construction
requirements.
         (b)   The Town Council may require, upon review and advice of the
Planning Director and/or Town Engineer, that additional maintenance surety be
provided for the portion of the public improvement which was subject to repair
for a time period of two years from the date the repair was completed.
      (2)   Two months prior to the expiration of the surety, the subdivider
shall make a written request to the Town Council for the release of the surety
on the expiration date. The request shall include the following:
         (a)   A description of the public improvements to which the surety
applies; and
         (b)   A report from the subdivider's engineer certifying that the
improvements remain free of construction related defects.
      (3)   The Planning Director and Town Engineer shall provide appropriate
inspections of the public improvements and the matter shall be placed on the
agenda for the appropriate meeting of the Town Council.
      (4)   If the Planning Director and Town Engineer report that the public
improvements are in satisfactory condition and free of construction related
defects, the Town Council shall release the maintenance surety and assume
complete responsibility for the upkeep of the improvements.
      (5)   If the Planning Director and/or Town Engineer report that the
public improvements are not in satisfactory condition and do contain unresolved
construction related defects then the Town Council may deny the request for the
release of the maintenance surety, providing a written statement of denial to
the subdivider which includes a detailed list of required corrections. The
petitioner shall make the required corrections and reapply for the release of
the surety.
         (a)   Subject to the approval of the Council, the subdivider may
provide a performance surety for any portion of the public improvements to be
corrected in lieu of the completion of the correction in order to obtain the
release of the maintenance surety.
         (b)   Generally, the use of performance surety in this manner shall be
limited to instances when weather conditions or other features unique to the
subdivision or nature of the public improvements prevent the timely completion
of the required corrections. In no case may the time period provided for the
completion of the corrections and the performance surety be more than one year
from the date of the Council meeting at which notice of the required
corrections is provided to the subdivider.
      (6)   In reviewing requests for the release of maintenance surety, the
Planning Director, Town Engineer, and Town Council shall consider the
following:
         (a)   Whether or not the improvements are free of construction related
defects;
         (b)   Whether or not the report provided by the subdivider's engineer
is complete and satisfactory;
         (c)   Whether or not the public improvements are in good condition and
appropriate for use by the public.
            1.   All streets and sidewalks shall be clear of all dirt, debris,
standing water, and construction equipment and/or supplies.
            2.   All drainage structures shall be clear of sedimentation,
debris, or other obstructions and be adequately secured to prevent access by
the public.
            3.   All erosion control measures shall be effective consistent
with applicable standards for the limiting of erosion and sedimentation.
            4.   The areas adjacent to all sidewalks shall be graded and
seeded.
            5.   All street trees shall be healthy and exhibiting a normal
growth pattern.
      (7)   In any case where the public improvements are not deemed to be free
of construction defects and otherwise in satisfactory condition two months
prior to the date the maintenance surety will expire, and the Town Council and
the subdivider are unable to reach agreement on an extension of the time frame
for the surety and the correction of the public improvements, the Council may
declare the surety to be in default. The required corrections to the public
improvements may then be made by the town, using the funds from the surety.
   (D)   Homeowners association. The developer will form a homeowners
association. The developer or its representative will serve as executive
director of the association for a period of five years. This is to provide
stability to the enactment and enforcement of local covenants within the
development.
   (E)   Surety shall have an automatic renewal clause, keeping the surety in
full force until it is released by the Town Council.

         (d)   Insure proper densities of population;
         (e)   Provide adequate utilities and public improvements;
         (f)   Insure the accurate survey and proper preparation of plats; and
         (g)   Protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the people.
   (B)   General standards.
      (1)   No land shall be subdivided for any use if the land is considered
by the Plan Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or
improper drainage, or objectionable earth or rock formations, topography or
other features harmful to the health, safety and welfare of future residents or
visitors and by the community as a whole.
      (2)   The Plan Commission may require either a general or operational
soil survey, with interpretations, where it is not readily apparent from
existing information that the land to be subdivided is not subject to flooding
or does not contain poor drainage characteristics.
         (a)   If required, the survey shall be conducted by a qualified person
or agency acceptable to the Plan Commission. In the event that the Plan
Commission finds the land to be subdivided unacceptable due to the results of
the soils survey, the Plan Commission shall not approve the plat.
         (b)   The Plan Commission may prescribe conditions that the subdivider
must meet to obtain approval and these conditions may be incorporated into an
agreement between the Plan Commission and the subdivider.
      (3)   The subdivision design and layout shall be such that it protects
the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents in the jurisdiction of
the Plan Commission.
      (4)   No parent tract (defined in §
155.192(B)(1)) which includes more than six lots (including the remaining
tract) shall be permitted unless public sewer and water systems are available
and will be used by all lots to be created and any remaining tract.
      (5)   In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision
plats shall comply with the following rules, laws, and regulations:
         (a)   The local zoning code, building and housing codes, and all other
applicable laws of the town and the statutory provisions of the State of
Indiana;
         (b)   The current Comprehensive Plan and Thoroughfare Plan as adopted
by the Town Council;
         (c)   The rules and regulations of the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management, the Department of Natural Resources, the Aeronautics
Commission, the County Drainage Board, and other appropriate agencies;
         (d)   The rules, regulations and standards of the Indiana Department
of Transportation (if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a
state highway);
         (e)   All applicable planning and regulatory guidelines, including
access control, driveway manuals, parking and traffic control codes, and other
applicable guides published or adopted by the town;
         (f)   The Indiana Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
placement and installation of traffic control devices.
      (6)   All subdivisions shall be designed on state plane coordinates.
   (C)   Lot standards.
      (1)   All lot sizes, setbacks, widths, width to depth ratios, and other
dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards provided by the Land Use and
Development Code.
         (a)   When not served by public water and sewer, the lot sizes and
other dimensions shall also conform with any additional requirements for the
adequate provision of sewage treatment and water supply as determined by the
County Health Department.
         (b)   In cases where the provisions of the zoning code and
requirements of the Health Department are in conflict, the more restrictive
shall apply.
      (2)   Side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to
straight streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from
this requirement is permissible, but irregular lots, such as flag lots shall be
avoided.
      (3)   The lot size, width, depth, shape, grade, location, and orientation
shall be in proper relation to the street and block design and to existing and
proposed topographical conditions.
      (4)   Every lot shall abut on a public street consistent with the
requirements of this subchapter and the Land Use and Development Code.
      (5 )    Double frontage lots (also known as through lots, shown below)
shall be avoided except where essentia l to provide separat ion of residen tial
develop ment from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
         (a)   For all through lots, a landscaped common area shall be provided
between the rear yard of the lots and the right-of-way of the adjacent street.
         (b)   The landscaped area shall be a minimum of 15 feet in width and
meet the following requirements:
            1.   A row of deciduous canopy trees shall be planted parallel to
the adjacent street, within the common area with trees placed an average of 20
feet apart. The trees shall measure two and one half inches in diameter at
nursery height (six inches above the root ball) at the time of planting.
            2.   A six-foot tall opaque wooden fence or brick or stone wall, a
four-foot tall undulating mound planted with shrubs, or a row of evergreen
trees shall be placed within the landscape common area between the deciduous
trees and the rear yard of the lots.
               a.   If an undulating mound is used to fulfill the requirements,
one shrub for every ten feet of continuous boundary shall be planted on the
mound. All required shrubs shall measure 18 inches in height measured from
grade at the time of planting.
               b.   If a row of evergreen trees is used to meet the
requirements, one tree shall be placed every ten feet long the common area.
Evergreens shall measure six feet in height at the time of planting.
      (6)   Corner lots shall be required to provide front yard setbacks on
both frontages, and shall be designed with adequate size and width to
accommodate the required setbacks and adequate buildable area.
      (7)   Lots shall be numbered consecutively throughout the entire
subdivision and shall be consistent with any phasing that may be planned for
the development.
      (8)   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainage way, channel, stream, or
flood plain shall have additional minimum width or depth as required to provide
an adequate building site and afford the minimum usable area required by the
zoning code from front, rear, and side yards.
      (9)   Direct vehicular access from lots to arterial streets shall be
prohibited. Lots in all developments shall generally be designed so as to
prevent vehicles from having to back into any collector street. All
nonresidential lots (including multifamily residential lots) shall generally be
designed so as to prevent vehicles from having to back into any public street.
   (D)   Block standards.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted where reverse or double frontage lots are used in blocks adjacent to
arterial or collectors streets, watercourses, or industrial or commercial
areas.
      (2)   Block length, width, and acreage within bounding streets shall be
such as to accommodate the size of lot required by the zoning code for the
district in which the subdivision is to be located, and to provide convenient
access, circulation control, and safety of street traffic.
      (3)   Blocks shall not exceed 800 feet in length, nor be less than 300
feet in length. In the case of a block exceeding 400 feet in length, a
pedestrian sidewalk a minimum of five feet in width shall be provided within an
easement not less than ten feet in the width near the center and entirely
across the block to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds,
common open space, shopping centers, transportation and other community
facilities.
         (a)   The sidewalks shall be constructed consistent with the sidewalks
construction standards provided in §
155.196.
   (E)   Street location and arrangement standards.
      (1)   General requirements. The arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade and location of all streets shall be correlated to existing and planned
streets, existing topography, public convenience and safety, and the proposed
uses of the land to be served by such streets.
         (a)   Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so
as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
         (b)   The street layout shall provide adequate vehicular access to all
lots and parcels of land within the subdivision.
      (2)   Design considerations. In designing and approving subdivision
streets, the following factors shall receive consideration:
         (a)   Accessibility for emergency vehicles and school buses;
         (b)   Safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
         (c)   Efficiency of service for all users;
         (d)   Connectivity between subdivisions and the development of
complete communities;
         (e)   Liabilities or amenities as affected by traffic elements in the
circulation system; and
         (f)   Economy of both construction and use of land.
      (3)   Thoroughfare Plan application. All proposed subdivisions shall
conform to the current Thoroughfare Plan adopted by the Town Council. Whenever
any tract to be subdivided embraces any part of the Thoroughfare Plan, that
part of the public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and
of the width recommended by the Thoroughfare Plan.
      (4)   Street arrangement. The arrangement of streets in all subdivisions
shall promote the continuation of existing streets, proposed future streets,
and streets to be provided as a result of the subdivision construction.
         (a)   Continuation of existing and proposed streets. The arrangement
of streets in all subdivisions shall provide for the continuation and
projection of existing and proposed streets on immediately adjacent properties
and in surrounding areas generally, or conform to a street plan of the general
area approved and adopted by the Plan Commission.
         (b)   Continuation of subdivision streets.
            1.    Right-of-way of proposed streets shall be extended to the
boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so that either:
               a.   At least one connection may be made to each adjacent
undeveloped property; or
               b.   At least one connection may be made for every 1,600 feet of
property line shared between the subdivision and adjacent undeveloped property.
In cases where these provisions are in conflict, that which provides the most
points of connectivity shall apply.
            2.   The Plan Commission may waive this requirement in cases where
the Commission deems that any such extension is not feasible due to topography
or other physical conditions, or the extension is not necessary or desirable
for the coordination of existing and future streets or not appropriate for the
development of adjacent property consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
            3.   No subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate
the land-locking of any adjacent undeveloped tract.
         (b)   Temporary dead-end streets. A temporary dead-end street shall be
permitted in any case in which a street is designed to be extended to adjacent
properties in the future.
            1.   Any dead-end street which extends more than one lot in length
shall be provided with a temporary cul-de-sac or other turn-around consistent
with the requirements of the Town Engineer.
            2.   Any temporary turn-around shall be included in a roadway
easement which shall be vacated to the property owners at the time the street
is extended or the Town Council, upon recommendation of the Town Engineer and
Planning Director, determines that the turn-around is no longer needed.
            3.   All temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with street
signage that indicate the road as being a dead end. The subdivider shall assume
all costs of the installation of the signs.
      (5)   Traffic separation requirements. Where a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector street as shown in the
Thoroughfare Plan, the Plan Commission may require:
         (a)   Marginal access streets;
         (b)   Reverse frontage contained in a non- access reservation along
the rear property line having a minimum width of five feet;
         (c)   Lots with rear service ways; or
         (d)   Any other such other treatments as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
      (6)   Service road requirements. Where a subdivision borders on, or
contains an existing or proposed interstate or other limited access highway or
arterial road as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan or a railroad right-of-way, the
Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to, and on each
side of the right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land (such as for park purposes in residential districts).
         (a)   Such distances shall be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
         (b)   The Plan Commission may require that the intervening land strips
be dedicated to the Town of Lowell or to a lot owners association for the
subdivision in which it is located. The land strip shall be maintained by the
involved government unit or lot owners association from the date of any such
dedication.
      (7)   Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited. Whenever a half-
street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within the tract.
      (8)   Improvement of existing streets. Whenever a proposed subdivision
borders or includes an existing street, the subdivider shall, as a condition of
plat approval, reconstruct or widen such street, install curbs and sidewalks,
and install any other improvement consistent with the requirements of this
subchapter for new streets developed as a part of the subdivision.
         (a)   Additional dedication of right-of-way shall be required
consistent with the adopted Thoroughfare Plan.
         (b)   Except for situations where a passing blister is required at the
entrance to a subdivision, this provision shall not be interpreted as requiring
the acquisition and dedication of right-of-way or the completion of
improvements extending onto property on the opposite side of a street adjacent
to the subdivision, where such property is not included in the street right-of-
way and not owned or otherwise controlled by the subdivider.
      (9)   Access requirements. Subdivisions of 20 lots or less shall be
limited to one point of access onto any arterial or collector road. For
subdivisions of greater than 20 lots, two or more streets, driveways, or points
of vehicle access may be approved or required by the Plan Commission if such
accesses are determined by the Plan Commission to be required for safe and
efficient traffic circulation or the continuation of existing streets, or are
otherwise recommended by the Thoroughfare Plan.
      (10)   Private streets. Private streets shall be prohibited.
         (a)   In no case shall this be interpreted as being in conflict with
the shared drive requirements of §
155.192.
         (b)   When there is a situation of unusual physical conditions or a
controlled design environment in evidence, and it can be satisfactorily
demonstrated to the Commission that a waiver of the public street requirement,
and the provision of a private street, is the only feasible solution, said
private street may be permitted and shall be equal in all aspects of
construction to like-classified public streets, including pavement section and
width.
            1.   A road way easement shall be provided which equates the right-
of way requirements for like classified public streets.
            2.   Required setbacks from the private street roadway easements
shall be equal to those which are required from the rights-of-way of like-
classified public streets.

perpetual operation, liability, and maintenance of said private streets at no
expense to any current or future governing jurisdiction.
   (F)   Street geometric standards.
      (1)   General requirements. The classification of all streets shall be
defined by the Thoroughfare Plan. The Plan Commission shall assign a
classification, based on the provisions of the Thoroughfare Plan, to all
proposed streets at the time of preliminary plat review and approval.
      (2)   Street measurement. Street width shall be measured from back of
curb to back of curb.
      (3)   Intersection requirements. Street intersections shall be designed
to promote the maintenance of the sight visibility triangle requirements of the
Land Use and Development Code and shall be consistent with the following
additional requirements;
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 80 degrees shall not be acceptable. All streets shall
intersect at 90 degrees whenever possible and maintain the 90-degree
orientation for a minimum distance of 100 feet in residentially used and/or
zoned areas and a distance of 300 feet in non-residentially zoned or used
areas.
         (b)   Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point,
unless specifically required to promote efficient and safe traffic movement or
in response to a recommendation of the Thoroughfare Plan.
         (c)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing or proposed
intersection on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center line
offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be permitted.
         (d)   Local street intersections shall be rounded by radii as
described in division (F)(7) below. The stated minimum radii shall be increased
as required by the Town Engineer when the angle of street intersection is less
than 90 degrees, and/or where necessary to accommodate a school bus or
emergency vehicle.

practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 100 feet in either direction, measured from the center line of the
intersecting street.
         (f)   At the intersection of any proposed local road with any existing
street, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and passing or left turn lanes may
be required by the Plan Commission and/or Town Engineer.
      (4)   Reverse curve requirements. A tangent of at least 200 and 150 feet
long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector
roads, respectively. All local roads shall have a tangent at least 100 feet
long on reverse curves.

as an alternative to providing curbs and gutters, a subdivider may make payment
to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and Gutter Standard Fund equal to 80% of
the total cost of the installation of curbs and gutters. The cash contribution
in lieu of installing curbs and gutters shall be computed on the basis of the
current average cost per linear foot of curb and gutter required.
         (a)   A subdivider's payment to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and
Gutter Standard Fund under this section does not obligate the town to install
curbs and gutters at any time on the subdivider's property. The subdivider's
cash contribution to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and Gutter Standard Fund

not be located less than one foot inside of the right-of-way line for the
adjacent road.
         (d)   Smooth transitions (slow tapers) are required if a sidewalk is
to be transitioned from one width to another.
         (e)   The surface of any sidewalk when completed shall have a
sufficient slope to drain toward the center of the street.
      (2)   Asphalt pedestrian paths, rather than concrete sidewalks are
permitted when they are a part of a trail system linking common open spaces,
public spaces, or natural features. All asphalt paths must be a minimum of
eight feet wide and meet the thickness and base requirements of the Town
Engineer.
      (3)   When sidewalks or pathways cross roads within or adjacent to the
subdivision, safety devices such as painted crosswalks, alternative pavement
types, signs, or traffic signals shall be installed.
      (4)   Easements of at least ten feet in width shall be provided for
sidewalks or pedestrian paths which are not completely included in public
right-of-way adjacent to a road. Pedestrian paths and sidewalks which link
common areas, public sites, or natural features as part of the subdivision's
open space design shall be included in the subdivision's common area, and may
not be located within an easement on private property.
      (5)   Payment in lieu of installation. In extraordinary circumstances,
the Planning Director may determine that the installation of sidewalks is
impossible or illogical. If the Planning Director makes this determination, as
an alternative to providing sidewalks, a subdivider may make payment to the
Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and Gutter Standard Fund equal to 80% of the total
cost of the installation of sidewalks. The cash contribution in lieu of
installing sidewalks shall be computed on the basis of the current average cost
per square foot of sidewalk required.
         (a)   A subdivider's payment to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and
Gutter Standard Fund under this section does not obligate the town to install
sidewalks at any time on the subdivider's property. The subdivider's cash
contribution to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and Gutter Standard Fund may
be used to install sidewalks anywhere in the town.
         (b)   Payment of the cash contribution in lieu of installing sidewalks
shall release the subdivider from the responsibility to install sidewalks at
the present time or any time in the future.
         (c)   If the Planning Director determines that the installation of
sidewalks is impossible or illogical and the sub-divider instead makes payment
to the Town of Lowell Sidewalk/Curb and Gutter Standard Fund, this information
shall be included in writing on the recorded plat of the subdivision.

road. The light fixtures shall be located in the planting strip which separates
the road pavement from the sidewalk.
      (4)   All costs related to the installation of the street lighting shall
be the responsibility of the subdivider. All costs relating to the use and
maintenance of the street lights shall be the responsibility of the lot owner's
in the subdivision.
   (K)   Subdivision and street name standards.
      (1)   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too
closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the town
covered by these regulations. The Plan Commission shall have final authority to
approve the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at the time of
the preliminary plat approval.
      (2)   Street names shall not duplicate any existing name within the town
except where a new street is a continuation of an existing street.
         (a)   Streets which are designed and/or shall function as the
extension of an existing street shall be named consistent with the existing
street.
         (b)   The term COURT shall be reserved for cul-de-sac streets. The

acres, the subdivider shall be required to plat a minimum of 500 square feet of
open space for each dwelling unit. The minimum amount of open space provided
shall be one acre. For the purposes of this calculation, a dwelling unit shall
be defined as a single-family home, condominium, or apartment/rental unit. As
an alternative to providing open space, the equivalent monetary value can be
donated to the Town of Lowell Park Improvement Fund. The cash contribution in
lieu of land shall be computed on the basis of fair market value of the land to
be subdivided. Fair market value of improved land in and surrounding the town
is now established at $15,000 per acre for purposes of this section.
         (a)   Easements, crosswalks, and road frontage to provide public
access to the common open space shall be shown on all required subdivision plat
drawings.
         (b)   Easements, roadways, and rights-of-way cannot be considered open
space.

by the leasing company for tenant-occupied developments and a lot owners
association for developments with individually owned dwelling units. In no case
may an access easement be substituted for a required common open space.
         (e)   Common areas being a minimum of ten feet wide, and including a
minimum five-foot wide concrete sidewalk or eight-foot wide asphalt trail,
shall be provided permitting access from natural site features such as
floodplains, detention ponds, and historic sites to public streets with
sidewalks.
         (f)   Access easements shall be provided for any private sidewalks
providing access to the common open space for persons outside the development.

the opinion of the Planning Director, that location would present a hazard for
underground or overhead utilities or public safety.
         (c)   Existing trees on property located in the right-of-way of a
public street may be considered as meeting the street tree requirement if such
trees are in good health and are protected during the construction process.
            1.   The Plan Commission shall determine whether or not existing
trees may be used to satisfy the street tree requirement at the time of
preliminary plat review.
            2.   The Planning Director may require the provision of maintenance
bonds consistent with §
155.192 for any existing trees preserved for use as street trees.

minimized.
      (4)   Functional and alignment continuity between developments must be
maintained.
      (5)   Adequately-sized and paved off-street parking must be a part of
each development.
      (6)   Pedestrian/bicycle routes should be encouraged, while maintaining
safe separation from vehicular movements.
      (7)   All industrial, highway-oriented businesses, and high-density
multi-family uses shall be provided principal access via an arterial.
      (8)   All neighborhood and general businesses and offices shall be
provided principal access via an arterial or collector.

and rather the structure and accompanying landscaping shall dominate the line
of sight.
      (16)   Access roads shall be defined and align with other roadways to
result in four-way intersections, rather than offset intersection.
      (17)   T or offset intersections shall be discouraged, but if

phase, and shall therefore not rely on any future phase in order to satisfy the
provisions of this policy.
   (D)    Urban design principles.
      (1)   The proposed development must be compatible as to form with
neighboring developments.
      (2)   Each development must become a part of a larger neighborhood, and
therefore cannot be an island unto itself.
      (3)   Each site to be developed must be well defined, and shall be large
enough to avoid a piecemeal approach.
      (4)   The development must be adequately screened and buffered to
minimize the ill effects of both the development on the surrounds and vice
versa, and to provide identity and definition to the development.
      (5)   Open space, trees and shrubs, fences, earth berms, or compatible
transitional land uses may all serve as buffers.
      (6)   Adequate landscaping shall be placed around the perimeter of the
site, near the building, and internal to the parking lot to minimize the ill
effect of excessive paved areas.
      (7)   Features that possess uniqueness on a site shall be preserved.
      (8)   Structures shall not be located in the floodway.
      (9)   Changes to the natural terrain, including stands of mature trees,
shall be minimized.
      (10)   Open space proposed by a developer must be accessible, and where
possible, linked to an overall town-wide system.
      (11)   The development must result in a separation of residential areas
from major noise-producing sources.
      (12)   Development shall be restricted on lands with steep slopes,
wetlands, unstable soil, filled areas, or areas of unique vegetation.
   (E)   Public services.
      (1)   The proposed development shall not pose an undo burden on police or
fire services.
      (2)   If the development results in a significant increase for park,
school or other public services, property dedicated for these purposes shall be
required as a condition of development.
      (3)   Appropriate right-of-way and easement dedications shall occur in
order to provide necessary access for proper utility maintenance.
      (4)   Streets internal to a development may be dedicated or private,
depending on their design and function.

§ 156.01 FINDINGS OF COUNCIL.
   There exist in the town, structures which are now or which may in the future
become substandard with respect to structure, equipment, maintenance or energy
efficiency. That such conditions, together with inadequate provision for light
and air, insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper heating,
unsanitary conditions or overcrowding, constitute a menace to public health,
safety and welfare of its citizens. It is further found and declared that the
existence of such conditions, factors or characteristics adversely affects
public health and safety and leans to the continuation, extension and
aggravation of urban blight. It is also found that the establishment and
enforcement of minimum property standards is necessary for the adequate
protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

features of any structure within an historic district.
   CONSERVATION DISTRICT. Pursuant to IC 36-7-11-19, the provision that a
district may be created which is called a CONSERVATION DISTRICT, the second
phase of which is the conversion to historic district status, if the Town
Council decides, after the conservation district has been in effect for three
years, to enact an ordinance to elevate the district to historic district
status. Regulation in a conservation district is less stringent than in an
historic district. In a conservation district, a certificate of appropriateness
must be granted for:
      (1)   The demolition of any building;
      (2)   The moving of any building;
      (3)   Any new construction of a principal building or accessory building
or structure subject to view from a public way.
   DEMOLITION. The complete or substantial removal of any historic structure or
any structure which is located within an historic district or conservation
district.
   DESIGN GUIDELINES. Criteria, locally developed, which identify local design
concerns in an effort to assist property owners in maintaining the character of
the designated district or buildings during the process of rehabilitation or
new construction.
   ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. Established when a preponderance of evidence establishes
that the property in question cannot obtain a reasonable economic return or be
put to any economically beneficial use.
   FAIR MARKET VALUE. The most probable price in cash, terms equivalent to
cash, or in other precisely revealed terms, for which the appraised property
will sell in a competitive market under all conditions requisite to a fair
sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and for
self-interest, and assuming that neither is under duress.
   HISTORIC DISTRICT. A single building, structure, object, or site or a
concentration of buildings, structures, objects, spaces, or sites designated by
ordinance adopted under this chapter. Property not so designated will not be
considered an historic district within the terms of this chapter.

   INTERESTED PARTY. One or any of the following:
      (1)   The Town Council President;
      (2)   The Town Council;
      (3)   The Town Plan Commission;
      (4)   A neighborhood association, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
a majority of whose members are residents of a historic district designated by
an ordinance adopted under this chapter;
      (5)   An owner or occupant of a property located in an historic district
established by an ordinance adopted under this chapter;
      (6)   Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, Inc., or any of its
successors;
      (7)   The state historic preservation officer under IC 14-3-3.4-10.
Editor’s note:

   PERSON. Includes a firm, a partnership, or a corporation, as well as an
individual.
   PRIMARY AREA. The principal area of historic and/or architectural
significance within an historic district.
   RATINGS.
      (1)   OUTSTANDING (O). The O rating means that the property has
sufficient historic or architectural significance that it is already listed, or
is eligible for individual listing, in the National Register of Historic
Places. Outstanding resources can be of local, state, or national importance.
      (2)   NOTABLE (N). The N rating means that the property does not merit
the outstanding rating, but it is still above average in its importance. A
notable structure may be eligible for the National Register.
      (3)   CONTRIBUTING (C). The C rating means the property is at least forty
years old, but does not meet the criteria of an O or N rating. Such resources
are important to the density or continuity of the area's historic fabric.
Contributing structures can be listed on the National Register only as part of
an historic district.
      (4)   NON-CONTRIBUTING (NC). Property rated NC is not included in an
inventoryunless it is located within the boundaries of an historic district.
Such properties may be less than 50 years old, or they may be older structures
that have been altered in such a way that they have lost their historic
character, or they may be otherwise incompatible with their historic
surroundings. These properties are not eligible for the National Register.
   REASONABLE RETURN. A measure of the economic return that is, or can be,
earned on the fair market value of a property, and that demonstrates that the
owner has not been deprived of all economically beneficial or productive use of

change that is not construction, removal or alteration and for which no
certificate of appropriateness is required.
   SECONDARY AREA. An area in an historic district that is adjacent to a
primary area and which has a visual relationship to the primary area and could
affect the preservation of the primary area. The purpose of designating a
secondary area is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent
primary area.
   STREETSCAPE. Appearance from a public way, the distinguishing
characteristics of which are created by the width of the street and sidewalks,
their paving materials and color, the design of the street furniture (e.g.,
street lamps, trash receptacles, benches, and the like), use of plant materials
such as trees and shrubs, and the setback, mass, and proportion of those
buildings which enclose the street.

out in §
157.40(B) of this chapter.

forthe demolition of any building; the moving of any building; and any new
construction of a principal building or accessory building, or structure
subject to view from a public way.

compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
      (4)   The Commission shall classify and designate all buildings and
structures within each proposed district as historic or non-historic. Historic
buildings or sites may include those buildings or sites that meet the
architecturally worthy criteria set out in §
157.27. The Commission shall further classify and designate all buildings and
structures within a proposed historic district as follows:
         (a)   Historic buildings and structures shall be further classified as
outstanding, notable, or contributing, as established by the Indiana State
Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology and the local survey.
         (b)   All non-historic buildings shall be classified as non-
contributing.
      (5)    A written report shall accompany all recommendations for
designation before the Town Council, in accordance with the criteria for
designation, stating the case for accepting the district.

notice as set forth in IC 5-3-1-1 et seq. In addition, the Commission shall
adopt rules that ensure that owners of all property within the proposed
historic district, and all adjacent property owners, as determined by the most
recent real estate tax lists, are forwarded written notice of the hearing on
the proposed historic district.
   (D)   A written report shall accompany the map submitted to the Town Council
validating the proposed district by addressing the criteria listed in §
157.27.
   (E)   The Town Council approves the map attached to Ord. 2009-22, marked
Exhibit A, setting forth the boundaries of the Lowell Downtown Historic
District. The District, as described in the map, runs along East Commercial
Avenue from the 200 Block to the 700 Block and includes the two commercial

§ 157.37 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to preserve historic buildings
and structures that are important to the education, culture, traditions, and
economic value of the community by affording the town, preservation
organizations, and interested persons the opportunity to acquire or arrange for
the preservation of these buildings.
   (B)   Certificate of appropriateness required. A certificate of
appropriateness must be issued by the Commission before a demolition permit is
issued by other agencies of the town and work is begun on the demolition of any
building or structure in any area of an historic district or conservation
district.
   (C)   Criteria for the Commission to consider in the case of a proposed
demolition shall include the following:
      (1)   Effect of the demolition on the character of the historic district;
      (2)   State of deterioration, disrepair, and structural stability of the
structure. The condition of the building resulting from neglect shall not be
considered grounds for demolition;

integrity of the district with the interest of the owner of the building or
structure in the use and utilization of the property; and
      (4)   Possible alternatives to demolition.
   (D)   Factors for allowing demolition without certificate of
appropriateness. If the Commission denies the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the demolition of a building or structure, a demolition
permit may be issued by other agencies and a building may be demolished, but
only after the property owner has established all of the following:
      (1)   The property owner must demonstrate to the Commission that an
historic building or structure is incapable of earning a reasonable return on
its value.
      (2)   The property owner shall file with the Administrator documented
evidence that a good faith effort is being made to sell or otherwise dispose of
such property to any public or private person or agency which gives a
reasonable assurance of its willingness to preserve and restore such property.
Such documented evidence shall be provided at the property owner's expense and
shall include:
         (a)   Offering price;
         (b)   Date the offer of sale began;
         (c)   Name and address of listing real estate agent, if any;
         (d)   A copy of an advertisement to run in the same manner as the
notice in §
157.26(A)(3) which offers the property for sale; and
         (e)   An appraisal of the property's fair market value by a licensed
real estate appraiser.
      (3)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed
by the Commission, based on the Commission classification on the approved map,
of not less than 60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be posted on the
premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location
clearly visible from the street. In addition, notice must be published in a
newspaper of general local circulation at least three times before demolition,
with the first publication not more than 15 days after the application for a
permit to demolish is filed, and the final publication at least 15 days before
the date of the permit issuance.
   (E)   The period of time that a building is placed upon the open market
shall be linked with its classification in the survey, as follows:
      (1)   Outstanding: 9 months;
      (2)   Notable:   6 months;
      (3)   Contributing:   4 months;
      (4)   Non-contributing: 3 months.
   (F)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any
time during the notice period described in division (E). If the certificate is
approved, a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay, and
demolition may proceed.

form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if necessary to ensure
visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
      (10)   Size of the building. The size of a building, and the building
mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches,
and balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings and places to
