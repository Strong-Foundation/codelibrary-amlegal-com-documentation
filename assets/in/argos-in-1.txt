immediately referred to the proper committee, or may be taken up by the entire
Council.

ordinance is lost and shall be stricken from the files.
   (D)   Alternative to reading through by sections. The requirement of reading
an ordinance through by sections on the second and third reading may be
complied with by providing each of the Council members with a complete copy of
the text of the ordinance and making sufficient additional complete copies

§ 35.01 COMMUNITY BUILDING USAGE POLICY.
   (A)   The town makes its facility located at 194 S. Michigan Street (also
known as the B&R Building) available to church, community, civic, and service
groups within the community. The town reserves the right to make full
determination as to whether a group may use its facilities.
   (B)   The following guidelines have been established to ensure the well-
being of the building and those who use it.
      (1)   Programmed town activities have priority over private rentals.
      (2)   No alcohol, tobacco, controlled substances, pets, or weapons are
allowed.
      (3)   Shoes, shirts, and appropriate dress must be worn at all times.
Footwear must be of a type that does not mar or damage the flooring.
      (4)   Safety of participants and spectators is the highest priority. Any
actions that jeopardize the safety of anyone in the building will not be
tolerated.
      (5)   No wheeled equipment (with the exception of wheelchairs) will be
allowed in the facility. (No bikes or skateboards.)
      (6)   Groups will ensure that children and teens are properly supervised.
Children or teens will not be left unattended whether inside or outside the
building without an adult. Children will not be allowed to roam or use the
building without an adult present in the building.
      (7)   Use of the kitchen stove and refrigerator is permitted, however,
the group must provide its own supplies and/or appliances (i.e., coffee maker,
coffee, towels, wash rags, cleaning supplies, and the like). The supplies that
are there have been purchased for a specific purpose. The group must not help
itself to the supplies. No form of red punch may be served.
      (8)   An application for use of the community building must be filled
out. When calling the Clerk-Treasurer’s office to schedule an event, the group
should follow through by filling out an application form, which also includes
the Waiver and Release Form on the back of the application. At that time, a
refundable deposit ($100) and a rental fee ($100) plus tax will be required.
The date will not be guaranteed until these fees have been paid. The group will
not be allowed to rent the Community Building if it has any outstanding bills
with the town.
      (9)   A key for the building may be picked up at the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office on the last business day before the event. This key must also be
returned the following business day or dropped in the night deposit box at the
Clerk-Treasurer’s office with the group name on it. The door must be locked
when the group leaves.
      (10)   All groups who rent the building are responsible for leaving the
facilities in the same condition they were found.
      (11)   Any equipment that is not working properly must be reported to the
Clerk-Treasurer’s office. Any damage done to the facility must also be
reported.
      (12)   Once the key has been returned to the Clerk-Treasurer’s office,
the condition of the facility will be inspected immediately. Once it is
determined the facility is in acceptable condition, a claim will be prepared
for the return of the deposit. The check will be sent pending approval of the
Town Council at a regular Council meeting.

§ 50.19 WRITTEN PAYMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Customers who are unable to make payment according to § 50.17 may enter into
written payment agreements with the town through the Utility Clerk to avoid
having their utility service disconnected provided they do so at the Clerk-
Treasurer's office no later than the twenty-eighth day of the month. In the
event that an agreement is made, an electric load limiter will be installed at
the service address for approximately 15 days or until the time the delinquent
balance is paid in full, whichever occurs first. There will be a $40 fee for
this service which must be collected before the agreement is signed. The
delinquent balance must be paid in full no later than the fifteenth of the
month following the date the agreement is signed. Failure to make any payment
due under such agreement shall constitute a "default" and shall result in the
customer's water and electric service being disconnected as provided in § 50.17
above. After a customer has defaulted on a payment agreement with the town, the
Utility Clerk may not resume the payment agreement with said customer unless
and until the customer has brought himself or herself into full compliance with
the terms of said payment agreement by paying all amounts then due plus the
disconnect fee in full. Any deviation from the above must be first approved by
the Town Council at an open meeting.

of utility shall be binding on utility unless such promises, agreements or
representations are incorporated in a written contract executed by a duly
authorized representative of utility.

customer assumes and agrees to be bound by the original contract, or to execute
a new contract for service.

agreement shall be required for each separate point of delivery. Service
delivered at each point of delivery shall be billed separately under the
applicable tariff.

but shall in no event be joint unless the application is executed by all joint
parties. In the event an account shall be in the names of more than one party,
each joint party shall be liable for the payment thereof, jointly and
severally.
   (J)   Utility may disconnect service to a premises at which applicant or co-

service furnished to applicant or co-applicant at another premises under the
same class of service.

the name of the property owner. In the case of renter occupied structures, the

         (b)   Any customer who has failed to pay all charges for service
rendered within the specified payment period may be required, upon five days

monthly town utility bills for a period of 12 consecutive months and, in the
case of a renter of residential property, timely payment when due of all
monthly town utility bills for a period of 24 consecutive months. Such customer
must make written application to the Clerk-Treasurer in order to be eligible
for a refund of his or her utility deposit.
      (2)   In the case of a resident of the town, whether a homeowner or
renter who has established a good record of payment of his or her town utility
bills but who has moved his or her residence to another location within the
town, the service deposit requirement may be waived, but only upon application
to and approval by the Town Council.
      (3)   For any property upon which the service deposit has been refunded
or waived and thereafter utility services are disconnected for delinquent
payment, then a new service deposit and reconnection charge will be required
before utility service will be re-established.
   (D)   The Utility may, but shall not be required, to apply the customer's
service deposit to payment of electric bills or any other charge.
   (E)   The service deposit, where chargeable, shall be applied against the
final bill when service has been terminated. Any outstanding credit balance
shall be refunded to the customer, and any outstanding debit balance shall be
billed to the customer.
   (F)   Any service deposit made by the customer (less any lawful deductions)
which has remained unclaimed for seven years after the town has made diligent
efforts to locate the person who made such deposit or the heirs of such person,
shall be presumed to be abandoned and treated in accordance with the laws of
the State of Indiana.

50.15 through
50.19 and applicable rate schedule for past due charges.
   (A)   Failure to receive a bill shall not entitle customer to pay the net

bill each month and, if bill is lost, utility will issue a duplicate bill.
   (B)   Utility has the right after sending written notice to customer to

(Ord. 2018-1, passed 3-21-2018)
§ 52.28 FRAUD, THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE.
   When the utility detects fraudulent or unauthorized use of electricity, or
that the utility's regulating, measuring equipment or other service facilities
have been tampered with, the utility may reasonably assume that the customer or
other user has benefited by such fraudulent or unauthorized use or such
tampering and, therefore, is responsible for payment of the reasonable cost of
the service used during the period such fraudulent or unauthorized use or
tampering occurred or is reasonably assumed to have occurred and is responsible
for the cost of field calls and for the cost of effecting repairs necessitated
by such use and/or tampering. In any event, the utility may make a charge for
such out-of-pocket costs. Under circumstances of fraud, theft, unauthorized use
of electricity, tamper or alteration of the utility's regulation, measuring
equipment and/or other service facilities, the utility may disconnect service
without notice and is not required to reconnect the service until a deposit and
all the aforementioned charges, or an estimate of such charges are paid in
full. In the event of fraud, theft or unauthorized use of electricity which is
not upon or connected with a customer's premises, the ultimate user of the
service shall be liable in the same manner as a customer for electric service
used, the incurred costs of field calls and the cost of effecting repairs, and

without first obtaining a written permit from the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   (1)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits:
         (a)   For residential and commercial service; and
         (b)   For service to establishments producing industrial waste.
      (2)   In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the town. The permit application
shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information
considered pertinent in the judgment of the Inspector. A permit and inspection
fee of $10 for a residential or commercial building sewer permit and $25 for an
industrial building sewer permit shall be paid to the Clerk-Treasurer at the
time the application is filed.
   (C)   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
town from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the building sewer.
   (D)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building. Except where one building stands at the rear of another or an
interior lot, and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
   (E)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found on examination and tests by the said Inspector to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   The building sewer shall be ductile iron soil pipe, DIP; ANSI A21.51
specification or polyvinyl chloride pipe (PVC); ASTM specification or equal; or
other suitable material approved by the said Inspector. Joints shall be tight
and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet
of a water service pipe shall be constructed of ductile iron soil pipe with
mechanical or O-ring joints or polyvinyl chloride pipe with gasket joints.
   (G)   The size and slope of the building sewers shall be subject to the
approval of the said Inspector, but in no event shall the diameter be less than
four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-
eighth-inch per foot.
   (H)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade and in straight alignment
insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with proper curved
pipes and fittings.
   (I)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drains shall
be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. No water-
operated sewage ejector shall be used.
   (J)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Inspector. Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with OSHA requirements,
except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by
the Inspector or his or her representative.
   (K)   All joints and connections shall be made gas tight and water tight. No
paint, varnish, or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material
until after the joint has been tested and approved. All joints in vitrified
clay pipe or between such pipe and metals shall be made with approving jointing
material in accordance with the latest edition of Volume III, Plumbing Rules
and Regulations of the Administrative Building Council of the state. Other
jointing materials and methods may be used by approval of the said Inspector.
   (L)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and a properly located “Y”
branch is not available, the owner shall, at his or her expense, install a “Y”
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the Inspector. Where
the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located
“Y” branch is available, a neat hole may be cut in the public sewer to receive
the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about
45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the
spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer.
The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be made at
the top one-quarter of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and
the connection made secure and water tight by resilient gaskets, epoxy cements,
or encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only
when approved by the Inspector.
   (M)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement drains,
sump pumps, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of
surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (N)   The connection of a building sewer into the public sewer shall conform
to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules
and regulations of the town, or the procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials and the Water
Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. MOP9. All such connections
shall be made gas tight and water tight. Any deviation from the prescribed
procedures and materials must be approved by the Inspector before installation.
   (O)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the said
Inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Inspector of his or her representative.
   (P)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with signs, barricades, and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the town.
All signs, barricades, and lights shall be in good condition and conform to the
Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

effluent will be compromised; and
         (j)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, permit to
be deposited, or discharged in any manner whatsoever, any substance into a
sewer at a point different than the proposed sewer connection to the sanitary
sewer system.
   (D)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the
judgment of the Town Council may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Town Council may:
      (1)   Require new industries or industries with significant increase in
discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval for discharges;
      (2)   Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed
appropriate by the town;
      (3)   Require pretreatment of such wastes to within the limits of normal
domestic sewage as defined;

any “slug” loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works;
and/or
      (5)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of having
capacity for and treating such wastes, if the Town Council permits the
pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Town
Council and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances,
and laws.
   (E)   Interceptors shall be provided by the discharger as necessary for the
removal of grease, flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful substances. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Town Council or
its designee, and shall be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection. The
owner and/or operator of interceptor equipment shall be required to maintain
certified records as to time and date of cleaning and inspection.
   (F)   When a discharger is required to provide preliminary treatment,
including interceptors or flow equalization facilities, such equipment shall be
maintained by the discharger in satisfactory operating condition as determined
by the Town Council or its designee.
   (G)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner or any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the town. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense,
and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all
times. Agents of the town, the State Water Pollution Control Agencies and the
USEPA shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, and testing.
   (H)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter, shall be conducted using
the methods and procedures in 40 C.F.R. part 136, and shall be determined at
the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole, except for application for NPDES permits and report thereof such shall
be conducted in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the USEPA, 40
C.F.R. Part 136 and any subsequent revisions subject to approval by the town.
In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried
out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect to constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life limb and
property. The particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and S.S. analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.
   (I)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste or unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance,
provided, however, that no special agreement or arrangement may be made with
the town which results in the violation of National Pretreatment Standards or
local limits.

§ 53.061 SPECIAL METERING.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 20,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices,
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
the determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building (other than a
single-family dwelling unit) discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastewater,
or other liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or
indirectly, and the user is one of the users listed below, then the amount of
water used and returned to the sanitary sewer shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the owner or other interested party at the owner’s expense by the
installing and maintaining of meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or
any adequate method of measurement approved by the town for determination of
sewage discharge:
      (1)   A user of water obtained from a source other than the municipal
waterworks of the town;
      (2)   A user of water of the municipal waterworks of the town, and in
addition uses water from another source;
      (3)   A user who diverts a portion of the water used on or in the
premises away from the sanitary sewage system;
      (4)   A user who uses a material amount of water in a product;
      (5)   A user with a material amount of the water used in or on the
premises evaporated and not discharged to the sanitary sewage system; or
      (6)   A user who has for any other reason water entering the sanitary
system under circumstances where the sewage flow is not accurately measured by
metering devices.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the town
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water, and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such case
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the minimum charge on the sewage rates and charges shall apply to each
of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as trailers, apartments
or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into
the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water, and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
such case billings shall be for a single service in the manner set out
elsewhere herein, except that such charge shall be not less than the multiple
of the dwelling units, times the minimum monthly charge for a five-eighths to
three-fourths inch meter. In the case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling
units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of trailers located
and installed in said park, plus any other dwelling units served through a
meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other
space in which cooking facilities are provided and having individual sink and

§ 53.062 SEWAGE STRENGTH.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the services rendered, the town shall have the right to base its charges not
only on volume, but also on the strength and character of the sewage and waste
which it is required to dispose of. The town shall have the right to measure
and determine the strength and content of all sewage and water discharged,
either directly or indirectly, into the town’s sanitary sewage system in such
manner and by such method as may be deemed practical in the light of the
conditions and attending circumstances of the case in order to determine the
proper charge. Any and all commercial and industrial installations shall be so
controlled and/or treated as to the sewage strength that their effluent
discharges to the town’s sewers shall have a BOD (Biochemical oxygen demand)
not to exceed 250 parts per million, and suspended solids not to exceed 250
parts per million at any time. The Town Council is authorized to prohibit the
dumping of wastes into the town’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are
deemed harmful.

shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer months, the
billings of sewage services for such users shall be based upon the average
water usage of the previous winter months of December, January, February, or
March.
   (B)   In the event the water usage for the months of June, July, August, and
September is greater than the water used by such user for the previous months
of December, January, February, or March, respectively, then the billing for
sewage services shall be computed on the water used for the previous months of
December, January, February, or March.
   (C)   In the event water usage is less in the summer months of June, July,
August, and September, then billing shall be based upon the actual water used
in those summer months.
   (D)   Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building
which is occupied and used as a residence. Said sprinkling rate shall not apply
to any premises which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial
purposes. In the event a portion of such premises shall be used for commercial
or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the
water service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through
a separate meter and in such case the water usage as registered by the water
meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes would
qualify under the sprinkling rate.

relieve the owners from liability in the event payment is not made as herein
required. The owners of property served which are occupied by tenant shall have
the right to examine the collection records of the town for the purpose of
determining whether such rates and charges have been paid by such tenants,
provided that such examination shall be made at the office in which such
records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.
   (B)   Billings for sewage rates and charges shall be made monthly and such
rates and charges, except as hereinbefore provided, shall be based upon the
quantity of water used on or in the property or premises as the same is
measured by the water meter therein used and said metered water usage shall be
determined from monthly meter readings of the town’s waterworks.
   (C)   Shut off and/or non-use of water service for any reason will not
exempt the customer from the base sewer charges during the period of shutoff or
non-use.

obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town, shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates. Except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown on the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building other than a
single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water, or other liquids into the town’s sanitary sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
town and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or
is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the town’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town of the
determination of sewage discharge.

§ 53.068 HEAVY DEMAND SURCHARGE.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The town shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary
sewage system, in such manner, by such method, and at such times as the town
may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstance of
the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a
central sampling point available to the town at all times.
   (B)   (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed ammonia-
nitrogen in excess of 25 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, biochemical oxygen demand in

additional charge of $0.52 per pound of ammonia-nitrogen received in excess of
25 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (d)   Rate surcharge based upon phosphorus. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.887 per pound of phosphorus received in excess of ten
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand,
ammonia-nitrogen, phosphorus, ammonia and CBOD contained in the waste shall be
in accordance with the latest copy of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, as written by the American Public Health Association, the
American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation,
and in accordance with Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants, 40 C.F.R. part 136.
   (D)   If the town and the user can agree upon the relationship between BOD
and CBOD, then CBOD may be used for calculating the BOD surcharge.

sewer with all charges billed to the owner. Any unpaid charges after 60 days of
billing shall be a lien that will be placed upon the property.
   (C)   Service at this property may only be reinstated when the property
owner arranges for and pays all costs associated with necessary reconnection of
the sanitary building sewer. In the event that the town has determined or
determines that the sanitary building sewer in the public right-of-way requires
replacement for any reason, the property owner will also be assessed the usual
and customary charges for reinstalling these services.

      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer of the town shall be authorized to return the
security deposit of any residential utility customer of the town upon the
establishment of a good record for making monthly utility payments on the part
of such customer as follows: In the case of a homeowner, timely payment when
due of all monthly town utility bills for a period of 12 consecutive months
and, in the case of a renter of residential property, timely payment when due
of all monthly town utility bills for a period of 24 consecutive months. Such
customer must make written application to the Clerk-Treasurer in order to be
eligible for a refund of his or her utility deposit.
      (2)   In the case of a resident of the town, whether a homeowner or

§ 54.024 WATER TURN-ON.
   (A)   Until a contract for water service has been executed and a meter has
been installed, water shall not be turned on at any premises by anyone but a
town water employee or authorized representative. No person except an
authorized employee of the Water Department, Fire Department, or any other
person authorized by the town shall open, operate, or remove the nozzle cap
from any hydrant to which water is supplied by the town. When water is required
by a plumbing contractor to test plumbing before a water contract has been
executed and a meter installed, a permit shall be obtained by the plumbing
contractor. It is a violation of the municipal code for anyone except a Water
Department employee or authorized representative to make such turn-on.
    (B)   In order to determine that no open spigot or fault exists in the
plumbing, a representative of the builder must be on hand at the site of the
building before water will be turned on by town personnel. When additional
visits must be made to turn on the service, an additional charge will be made.
   (C)   When water service is to be transferred and meter has been left in for
the convenience of the town with the service shut off at the valve ahead of the
meter, the valve shall be sealed and only an employee of the Water Department
is authorized to break the seal and provide service.
   (D)   The customer must notify the town when the billing is to be
transferred to a new customer, otherwise the original customer will be billed
until such record of transfer is made available to the town.
   (E)   The customer shall install or have installed an operable shut-off
valve located at the point of entry into the premises before service will be
turned on or resumed, in the case of a disconnection.
(1996 Code, § 104.107) (Ord. 502, passed 8-12-1996; Ord. 1997-2, passed 6-9-
1997; Ord. 99-5, passed 5-10-1999; Ord. 2010-4, passed - -2010) Penalty, see §
54.999
§ 54.025 SERVICE CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Where large connections are made as a part of the initial installation
of “on-site” mains, they shall be installed by the developer. All other
connections or taps shall be made by town personnel at the expense of the
customer or developer. Charges for a three-fourths-inch service shall be $500
plus the cost of the meter and materials used by the town. The charge for a
one-inch meter shall be $750 plus the cost of the meter and materials used by
the town. The charge for any service larger than one inch shall be $1,000 plus
the cost of the meter and materials and must be installed by contractor. A tap
order shall be obtained from the town for each service connection.
   (B)   (1)   When an individual service is sought for acreage or developed
areas inside or outside the corporate limits of the town, the following water
users, listed by type of occupancy, shall pay a “user” contribution to
partially reimburse the town for the supply, treatment, pumping, and storage
facilities which are required to furnish water to new installations. This
contribution shall be paid into the town waterworks “Water Facilities Expansion
Fund”, which is a depository for said contributions. The funds accumulated will
be used only to assist in financing the cost of construction of the above-
described facilities when they are required. Payment of the contribution may be
by lump sum or may be pro-rated by contract over a period of time and added to
the monthly water bill. The “equivalent” user unit of 1 is based on a single-
family residence, and the “equivalent” user contribution is hereby initially
established at $200. The units listed below will presently pay a contribution
based on the multiplication of the listed decimal times the established user
contribution. The equivalent user contribution as well as the multiplication
factors listed below may, from time to time, be updated and changed by the Town
Council.

      (2)   Contributions of users not listed will be computed based on
estimated usage. All users shall also be billed a monthly water rate based on
estimated usage. All users shall also be billed a monthly water rate according
to established rates on file with the Town Clerk-Treasurer. Except for single-
family residential users where a user has consumed metered water for a
continuous 18-month period, the town will review its contribution set forth
based upon usage for the preceding 12-month metered period, and will adjust the
unit contribution in accordance with actual usage, either upward or downward as
the metered usage reflects. This adjustment will fix the unit contribution for
the particular user and no further adjustments will thereafter be made. For the
purpose of reviewing the unit contribution, the usage of a single-family
residence will be considered as 5,000 gallons per month.
   (C)   Each connection to the distribution main shall be installed so that a
line perpendicular to the long axis of the main at the connection will
intersect the meter location. Under certain conditions (such as locations where
mains are not laid in a straight line or where buildings are not parallel with
the street) the connection may be located so the line perpendicular to the face
of the building will intersect both the meter and the connection. A valve shall
be installed immediately adjacent to the main for connections larger than two
inches. A corporation stop shall be inserted in the main for connections two
inches or smaller. Maximum size corporation tap for a six-inch main is one
inch, for eight-inch and ten-inch mains, one and one-half inches, and for
larger mains, two inches. For larger size services up to two inches on six-,
eight- and ten-inch mains, multiple taps and saddles may be used.
   (D)   (1)   For each service, a valve shall be installed near the property
line in the public right-of-way. For service one inch and smaller, the town
will furnish and install the service pipe from the main to the curb stop.
      (2)   The town reserves the right to locate the stop at:
         (a)   The curb line;
         (b)   Inside line of the sidewalk; or
         (c)   At the property line, the most satisfactory locations for the
curb stop and service box.
      (3)   For connections larger than one inch, the customer or developer
shall furnish and install the service stop and service pipe from the valve at
the distribution main to the property line. Service stop shall be located as
directed by the town. All valves, pipe, and valve boxes shall conform to
requirements of the town’s material specifications. Depth of cover for service
pipe shall be four feet six inches minimum.
   (E)   The customer shall, at his or her own expense, install and maintain
the service pipe from the curb or service stop to the meter. Service pipes
between curb stop and meter shall conform to requirements of the town’s
material specifications. The town or its authorized representative shall
inspect each service pipe before the trench is backfilled. As a rule, water
service will only be furnished to one property through a single service pipe. A
separate service pipe is required for each water meter installed.
   (F)   Taps will not be installed until platting has been approved, rough
grading has been completed, and sidewalks, curbs, and structures to be served
have been located.
      (1)   If the service pipe from the house to the service stop is installed
prior to the town installing the tap, the end of the pipe shall be plainly
marked, or the service pipe shall project above the surface to show its
locations. Sufficient pipe is to be installed to allow proper location of the
service stop.
      (2)   The customer will make the connection between the town’s service
pipe and the customer’s service pipe if the pipe from the building is installed
and available.
   (G)   The town will make every reasonable effort to assist the customer or
developer in scheduling the tapping of the distribution for orderly
installation of the service pipe.
   (H)   Any developer, general contractor, or person responsible for
disturbing or damaging water services or valve boxes, once the services have
been properly installed, shall be liable for the cost of repairs.

54.999
§ 54.026 METERING.
   (A)   (1)   Unless otherwise specified in the contract between the town and
the customer, the water supplied will be measured by a meter or meters of
standard manufacture, furnished and installed by the town according to its
requirements in force and effect as amended from time to time. The customer
shall provide for this purpose, free of expense to the town, a suitable area
near the service entrance either in the basement, or in a location which is
approved by the town before installation. Residential meters shall be installed
three feet to three feet, six inches above the floor and as shown in standard
meter installation drawings which may be obtained from the town.
      (2)   Customer shall provide and maintain suitable means of access to the
meter with no obstructions of any kind within three feet of the meter. Customer
shall provide and install an approved shut off valve on the inlet side of the
meter and a stop and drain valve on the house side of the meter specified by
the town. One-inch meters shall be installed in yokes. For one and one-half and
two-inch meters, a spacer and flanges shall be installed as specified by the
town. As a convenience, the town stocks yokes, flanges, and spacers and will
upon request sell to the customer. A remote reading device will be installed by
the town at a mutual agreeable location. For meters one and one-half inches and
larger, the installation shall conform in all respects to standard meter
installation details which may be obtained from the town.
   (B)   A charge will be made for each meter installation. For new services,
this charge is included in the connection or tap charge. For customers desiring
service where existing taps, service lines, and yokes may be used, the charge
is included in the contract charge. This charge is based on the average cost of
installing meters and the town may, from time to time, adjust these charges to
reflect current charges.
   (C)   If a customer requests for his or her convenience or by his or her
actions requires that town facilities be redesigned, re-engineered, relocated,
removed, modified, or reinstalled, the town may require the customer to make
payment to it of the full cost of performing such service.
   (D)   The town reserves the rights to determine the kind and size of meter
that shall be used on any service pipe. The water supplied for each customer’s
premises shall ordinarily be measured by a single meter of standard manufacture
installed by the town. However, for the convenience of the town, more than one
meter may be installed for capacity purposes on the same class of service, on
the same premises for the same customer. In this case, meter readings shall be
aggregated and billed as if from a single meter. When for the convenience of
the customer, water for a premises is metered at more than one service line,
each meter shall be billed separately.
   (E)   When the customer will permanently require for his or her own use and
convenience one or more additional meter for the same class of service in any
one premise, the customer may purchase the meter or meters from the town. The
town will not supply extra meters except for temporary installation. When such
temporary extra meters are installed at the request of the customer, the
customer shall be required to pay the cost of all materials required for the
installation and removal. A rental charge, dependent upon size and type of
meter, will be made for each extra meter.
   (F)   The properly authorized agents of the town shall have the right to
enter upon the premises of the customer at all reasonable times for the purpose
of inspecting, reading, testing, repairing, or replacing the meter or meters,
appliances, and equipment used in connection with its service and removing the
same on the termination of the contact or the discontinuance of the service.
   (G)   All meters or other appliances and equipment which are furnished by
and at the expense of the town and which may at any time be on the customer’s
premises shall, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, be and remain the
property of the town. The customer shall protect such property from freezing
and from loss or damage and no one who is not a representative of the utility
shall be permitted to remove such property or tamper therewith.
   (H)   Ordinary repairs to meters will be made by the town without expense to
the customer. Repairs of damage caused by carelessness or neglect on the part
of the customer including damage from freezing or from hot water, will also be
made by the town, but the cost of such repairs shall be charged to the
customer. After a second instance of a damaged meter due to negligence of the
customer, the town may discontinue service until the customer properly protects
the meter from damage.
   (I)   A meter will be tested by the town upon request of the customer, but
not more frequently than once in 12 months. A report of the results of such a
test will be made to the customer and a complete record of the test will be
kept on file in the office of the town. The customer may be, and is encouraged
to be, present or have a representative present when the meter is tested. If a
test requested by the customer established that the meter is over-registering
more than 2% no charge will be made for the test and the adjustment shall be
made for the difference during the time of the malfunction up to a period of
one year. Otherwise the town shall charge the customer for making the test in
accordance with the schedule on file with the town.
   (J)   When a residential meter is found to under register in excess of 2% in
tests made at the request of the customer, the town may charge the customer for
the water incorrectly metered for the period equal to one-half of the time
elapsed since the previous test, but not to exceed six months. If a meter is
found not to register for any period, the town shall estimate the charge for
the water used by averaging the amounts registered over similar periods, or
over corresponding periods in previous years.
   (K)   For the determination of residential meter accuracy, the town shall
use the appropriate test flows specified by the American Water Works
Association for the various type of meters. Tests on large meters shall be as
recommended by the water manufacturer. If under registration, the cost of the

§ 54.027 METER READINGS AND BILLINGS.
   (A)   Meters will be read monthly and bills will be rendered monthly
according to the schedule of rates on file with the town. When weather does not
permit, pit meters may not be read at monthly intervals at the discretion of
the Superintendent. If a bill is not paid before the due date indicated on the
bill, the customer will be considered delinquent and, at any time thereafter
prior to the payment thereof, the town may, after serving notice, discontinue
service. Failure to receive the bill shall not affect the right of the town to
discontinue service for non-payment.
   (B)   All water charges accrue to the customer rather than the premises. If
a customer moves from premises where he or she has been supplied with water
service, he or she will be held responsible for the payment of all bills until
he or she gives proper notice to the town that service is to be discontinued at
said premises.
   (C)   Bills for public fire protection and private fire protection shall be
rendered yearly. Rates are on file with the town.
   (D)   All special services for which cash payment is not required will be
billed with the next regular monthly bill following the date the service was
performed. Rates for special services are on file with the town.
   (E)   Each bill shall be due upon receipt and payable at the customer
service office of the town or at such other place as may be designated by the
town. A penalty may be added to any bill not paid by the due date printed on
the bill.
   (F)   All charges for water service, other than service charges, if any,
shall be based on the registration of the meter or meters installed.
   (G)   The town shall make an effort to read meters at least once a month and
such reading shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of water used. If the
town is temporarily unable to gain access to a customer’s property, the
customer shall be billed an estimated charge based on previous meter readings
unless customer promptly and accurately fills out and mails post card left by
the meter reader. The first billing made after the meter is read shall be
adjusted according to the actual meter reading. No more than two estimated
readings will be allowed. Failure to make meter available or to send in post
card readings for three consecutive quarters will result in disconnection of
service. A maximum of four consecutive post card readings, promptly submitted
by the customer, will be allowed before a customer is required to install an
outside remote reading device or to make arrangements for a special meter
reading.
   (H)   All water passing through meters shall be charged for, whether used,
wasted, or lost through leakage.
   (I)   Disputing the accuracy of a bill shall not be reason for non-payment
of the bill by the customer. The customer may pay a bill under protest, thus
giving written notice that redress is being sought. Such written notice must be
filed with the Clerk-Treasurer prior to the due date of the bill.

§ 54.028 MAINTENANCE OF SERVICE LINES AND METER BOXES.
   (A)   All service lines one inch and smaller from the distribution main to
and including the curb stop and box, shall be maintained in good repair at the
expense of the town, including the replacement thereof if necessitated because
of corrosion, tuberculation, or other deterioration. However, if replacement is
necessary due to increased demand or damage caused by the customer, such
replacement shall be at the customer’s expense.
   (B)   All service lines and fixtures from the curb stop to the meter, and
all service lines one inch and larger from the distribution main to the meter,
shall be installed and maintained at the expense of the owner. Any leaks or
other defects shall be properly and promptly repaired by him or her. Existing
services extended to property not adjacent to the water main, whether through
public or private property, shall be considered a private service line. The
maintenance of said line shall be the customer’s responsibility, unless said
line or main has been accepted in writing for maintenance by the town prior to
its installation. If needed repairs are not made to service lines or private
lines within five days of notification by the town, the property owners may be
charged the sum of $5 per day for each day following the five-day period of
grace that the water wastage is allowed to continue. In cases of emergency, the
town will shut off the water, make the repair, and charge the customer for this
service on the basis of actual cost plus overhead expenses.
   (C)   All meter boxes (including pits or vaults) constructed or installed by
the owner, regardless of location, and all such boxes constructed or installed
by the town and located on private property shall be maintained in good repair
by the town, and any necessary repairs charged to the owner.
   (D)   Effective upon the adoption of this code, no new private service lines
or new connections to existing private service lines will be permitted. After
this date, service will only be furnished to properties located adjacent to a
water main. Billing made after the meter is read shall be adjusted according to
the actual meter reading.

and/or the rules and regulations of the town in force at that time. Copies of
the State Board of Health regulations and town requirements are on file for the
benefit and inspection of parties concerned.
   (B)   All plumbing shall conform to the State Plumbing Code, which does not
permit physical connections between the public water supply and waste lines,
process solution lines, tanks, and the like, unless properly protected by
approved safety devices.
   (C)   As a condition to receiving water service, the customer shall grant to
the town, upon request, the right to enter the customer’s premises to make
periodic inspections of customer’s piping. The town will report any violations,
as set out in divisions (A) and (B) above, to both the customer and to the
respective regulatory authority. The town will not assume responsibility for
damage, sickness, or death arising from the existence of an improper cross-
connection or the use or failure of a cross-connection prevention device.

54.999
§ 54.031 GROUNDWIRES.
   The town is aware that telephone and electric companies may ground wires to
water lines. The town does not install such connections; derives no benefit
from them; and tolerates them only because of their reputed importance to safe
and effective telephone and electric service. When and if they are found to
appear to be the cause of damage, the town may order them removed, and may
discontinue service until they are removed.

invalidate any contract and the town shall have the right to enforce any
contract notwithstanding such discontinuance.
   (F)   In each case, except those arising under divisions (E)(1)(a), (E)(1)
(b), (E)(1)(f), (E)(1)(p), or (E)(1)(q) above, the town shall give written
notice of at least five days either mailed to such customer at his or her
address as shown upon the town’s records or personally delivered to him or her
or a person on the premises, advising the customer the reason for the proposed
discontinuance of service and stating that service will be discontinued if the
condition continues uncorrected. In cases provided for in divisions (E)(1)(a),
(E)(1)(b), (E)(1)(f), (E)(1)(p), or (E)(1)(q), the town may discontinue service
without notice.
   (G)   Whenever the service is turned off for reasons other than divisions
(E)(1)(a), (E)(1)(b), (E)(1)(f), (E)(1)(p), or (E)(1)(q) above, a reconnection
charge shall be paid after the condition resulting in the turn-off is remedied
and prior to the restoration of service. This charge shall be determined by the
town and may, from time to time, be revised to reflect current costs. When
condition requiring turn-off is not remedied prior to arrival of the town’s
serviceperson at premises, to make the turn-off and customer then makes remedy,
a service charge rather than a reconnection charge will be made. Service charge
shall be one-half the reconnection charge.
   (H)   The remedies provided to the town in these rules and regulations shall
not be exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which the town
has at law or in equity.

§ 90.068 IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   All animals found to be at large, stray, or being a public nuisance
may be taken by the police or humane officer and impounded.
   (B)   If any dangerous, ferocious, or vicious animal is found at large and
cannot be safely taken up and impounded, the animal may be tranquilized, slain,
or humanely euthanized to prevent undue suffering, by a police officer or his
or her designee, or humane officer.
   (C)   Impounded dogs and cats not wearing town tags (license) must be kept
for no fewer than two days before being adopted out or humanely euthanized.
   (D)   If dogs and cats wearing town tags (licenses) are impounded by the
Animal Control Agency, an attempt shall be made by the Humane Officer to return
said animal to the owner, as indicated on the records of the Animal Control
Agency, as soon as is practical after the time of the impoundment. If said
attempt to return said animal is impossible or without success, the Animal
Control Agency shall send a written notice to the owner at the address
indicated in the records of the Animal Control Agency, that said agency has in
its possession said animal and that unless said animal is claimed by the owner
within 14 days from the date of said impoundment said animal may be placed for
adoption, or humanely euthanized. This process shall be followed for the first
offense only. On second and subsequent violation, the impounded dog or cat
wearing town tags (licenses) shall be kept for no fewer than five days to
permit their owners to claim them. After the fifth day of said second or
subsequent violation, such dogs or cats may be placed for adoption or humanely
euthanized if their owners have not claimed them and paid the required fees.
   (E)   All other impounded animals (except dogs and cats specifically covered
herein) shall be under the authority of the humane officer. The animals shall
be held at least one day, after which time the animal shelter shall have the
authority to take whatever action is necessary with regard to adoption or
euthanasia of such animals.
   (F)   An owner reclaiming an impounded animal shall pay to the Animal
Control Agency its then-current redemption fee plus total daily boarding fee
for redemption of the animal.
   (G)   No unlicensed dog or cat shall be released from an animal shelter
without a license being issued in accordance with this chapter, except a dog or
cat less than six months old. However, because proof of current, effective
rabies vaccination is required before the license is issued, if such shelter
does not have licensed veterinary services on site to administer such required
rabies vaccination, the dog or cat may be released upon presentation of a
veterinarian’s charges for such vaccination, and must be vaccinated within 48
hours after such release, and the owner shall supply proof of same to said
Animal Control Agency within 72 hours after the release, at which time the
license tag shall be issued. Failure of the animal owner to obtain such
vaccination after such release shall constitute a breach of the release
agreement and entitle the Animal Control Agency to regain possession of the
animal.
    (H)   (1)   An animal owner redeeming an impounded animal belonging to him
or her shall pay to the town or its agent a redemption fee of $10 on the
occasion that an animal belonging to that owner is impounded, before such
animal is released to such owner by the Animal Control Agency. Such redemption
fee shall increase by an additional $25 per impoundment for each subsequent
time within a three-month period that the same or any other animal belonging to
the same owner may be impounded.
      (2)   The Animal Control Agency shall collect all such licensing and
redemption fees for the town and shall account to the town and pay over to the
Clerk-Treasurer such amounts of such fees as required by the animal control
contract between the town and the Animal Control Agency then in effect.
   (I)   The Animal Control Agency shall have authority to take whatever action
is reasonably necessary, including humane euthanization, to deal with a sick or
injured animal, for the welfare of the animal and for the safety of humane
officers and the public.
   (J)   In the event that an animal is retained at the impounding facility
because its owner has been in violation of this chapter, the person redeeming
the animal by paying the redemption fee shall also be subject to paying for
veterinary bills incurred, for routine vaccinations for the animal(s) if
necessary, veterinary services, boarding fees, all pertinent expenses, and all
applicable permit and/or licensing fees reasonably necessary and incurred for
the benefit of the animal.
   (K)   Any animal impounded in an animal control facility, if not reclaimed
by its owner as provided for herein, shall thereby become the property of the
Animal Control Agency and, if not adopted out, must be humanely euthanized.

offense, and $50 for each offense thereafter. If any violation is continuing,

committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

employees designated by the Town Council. When a nuisance has been reported in
such manner, the owner, tenant, and/or any other person in possession of the
property upon which the nuisance is reported to exist shall cooperate in
allowing the inspection of such property by such town officials or employees to

shall, without more, justify a finding by the Town Council that the nuisance
does in fact exist as provided in §
91.06 below.

duty of the Code Enforcement Officer appointed by the Town Council, or any law
enforcement officer, to serve notice on the owner or occupant of the premises
and any other person having a substantial property interest in the premises
where such nuisance exists, or any other persons causing such nuisance, to
abate such nuisance within a reasonable time period. In determining such
reasonable time, the Council, Code Enforcement Officer and/or law enforcement
officer shall take into consideration the degree of threat to the public
health, safety, and welfare, and the means required to abate such nuisance.
This notice may take the form of a written letter, or a uniform code and
ordinance violation notice.
   (B)   In the event that the notice takes the form of a written letter, it
shall not be necessary for the Council and/or Code Enforcement Officer to
designate in this notice the manner in which any nuisance shall be abated
unless the Council and/or Code Enforcement Officer shall deem it advisable to
do so. However, the Council and/or Code Enforcement Officer shall indicate in
such notice the date within which the nuisance must be abated.
   (C)   If the nuisance is not satisfactorily abated in the time allowed by
such notice, or in the case of emergency, the Council may cause such nuisances
to be abated in any manner authorized by law, including the institution in the
name of this town of an action therefor against the owner, occupant, or other
persons for the recovery of the amount of expense of such abatement, including
reasonable attorney fees and other legal expenses involved.
   (D)   As an additional remedy (if allowed by law), the Council shall notify
the Clerk-Treasurer of the cost of abating any nuisance. The Clerk-Treasurer

Ordinance."
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Argos Town Council recognizes and concludes that the proper and
reasonable maintenance, appearance and use of the cemetery or cemeteries owned
or controlled by the town is an important function of the government of the
town. It is also important that burials, disinterment and other matters
associated with a municipal cemetery are handled in a respectful and proper way
in order to promote the safety, public health and general welfare of the
community. The Town Council finds that the adoption and enforcement of this
chapter is in the best interests of the property owners and residents of the
town.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.03 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CEMETERY PLOT. Shall consist of an area in Maple Grove Cemetery sufficient
to accommodate one full burial space for one deceased person. It shall consist
of a land area at least 40 inches wide and 96 inches in length.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.04 SALE OF CEMETERY PLOTS AND TRANSFER OF PLOTS.
   (A)   After the effective date of this chapter, cemetery plots shall be sold
by the town for the purpose of burial for the purchaser of a cemetery plot, or
his or her immediate family. No sale shall be made to funeral directors or
others.
   (B)   All sales and transfers of cemetery plots will be administered through
the Clerk-Treasurer's office using a form approved by the Town Council and
signed by the designated town official, which grants a right of burial only and
does not convey any other title or right to the cemetery plot or burial space
sold. Such forms shall be signed by the Town Clerk-Treasurer or Deputy Town
Clerk-Treasurer.
   (C)   At the time of purchase from the town, each cemetery plot shall be
assigned the name of the specific person (if available) who shall be interred
in that cemetery plot upon death. If the owner of a cemetery plot desires to
effectuate a name change regarding the assigned cemetery plot, that person must
present the originally issued deed along with a letter stating whom and how
many plots are to be transferred. At that time, the current fee for recording
must be paid for each deed that is to be reissued. The fee will be listed in
the most recent cemetery fee schedule resolution.
   (D)   The fee needed to record the deed information with the Marshall County
Recorder's Office is included in the price of the cemetery plot. The Clerk-
Treasurer's Office will be responsible for recording the deed prior to it being
issued. Once recorded, the deed will be mailed, so a mailing address will be
required at the time the plot is purchased.
   (E)   Cemetery plots may be sold back for the original purchase price to the
town. Any plot sold back to the town that is located in the "older sections" of
Maple Grove (plot numbers between 1 and 999) may or may not be available for
resale. The Town Council will be responsible for that determination.
   (F)   The Town Council shall have the authority to place a limit on the
number of cemetery plots sold to a particular person, as well as such person's
family and relatives. Furthermore, the town shall have the absolute right and
discretion to determine whether a particular cemetery plot or plot(s) will be
sold to a specific person and where such cemetery plot or plots will be located
within the town cemetery. Such decision shall be based upon reasonable factors,
including, but not limited to, the number of vacant cemetery plots available
and whether family or relatives of the person seeking to purchase a cemetery
plot or plots are buried adjacent or nearby the cemetery plot or plots
requested.
   (G)   The town shall have the right to correct any errors that may be made
concerning interments, disinterment, or in the description, transfer or
conveyance of any cemetery plot, either by canceling the permit for a
particular vacant cemetery plot or plots and substituting and conveying in lieu
thereof another vacant cemetery plot or plots in a similar location within the
cemetery at issue or by refunding the money paid for the cemetery plot to the
purchaser or the successor of the purchaser. In the event that an error
involves the interment of the remains of any person, the town shall have the
right to remove and transfer the remains so interred to another cemetery plot
in a similar location in the same cemetery in accordance with law.
   (H)   The owner of every cemetery plot shall be responsible for notifying
the town whenever that person's mailing address or contact information changes.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.05 PURCHASE PRICE FOR CEMETERY PLOTS; INDIGENT BURIALS.
   (A)   The fee will be listed in the most recent cemetery fee schedule
resolution. The lawful owner of any cemetery plot within the cemetery shall
promptly provide the Clerk-Treasurer's office with any change in that owner's
mailing address.
   (B)   All charges shall be paid to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (C)   A payment contract may be signed for purchasing a cemetery plot.
Regular payments must be made (no longer than 30 days lapse between them) on
the contract and it must be paid in full within six months. If these conditions
are not met, the contract will become void. If the contract is deemed void, the
plot will then be forfeited and will then be made available for purchase again
and all payments made up to that time will also be forfeited.
   (D)   The Town Council may waive some or all fees for the burial of indigent
persons.
   (E)   The Town Council may by resolution periodically alter the foregoing
fees to accommodate increased costs and needed funds for cemetery maintenance
and acquisition.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.06 GRAVE OPENING CHARGES.
   (A)   The town may charge reasonable fees for the opening and closing of any
cemetery plot, prior to and following a burial therein, and including the
interment of ashes. Such fees shall be set as Attachment A to Ord. 2023-06,
payable to the Town of Argos.
   (B)   No cemetery plot shall be opened or closed except under the direction
and control of the town or a funeral director. This division (B) shall not
apply to any grave opening, disinterment, or similar matter which is done
pursuant to a valid court order or under the supervision and direction of local
or state health department authorities; however, even in such cases, the town
shall be given at least 24 hours' prior notice of when such grave opening or
closing will occur.
   (C)   Fees for opening and closing for any type of burial must be paid in
advance before interment unless the service is conducted by an established
funeral home that has included that fee as part of the service.
   (D)   The Town Council will designate who is allowed to perform openings and
closings. No opening is allowed without the knowledge of the Town Council or
the Clerk-Treasurer's office.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 4-19-2023)
§ 96.07 MARKERS OR MEMORIALS; NO MONUMENTS.
   (A)   All markers and memorials must be comprised of stone or other equally
durable composition and shall face the same direction as the markers and
memorials around them.
   (B)   Temporary markers are considered to be property of the Maple Grove
Cemetery.
   (C)   Except for monuments that existed in Maple Grove Cemetery before the
effective date of this chapter, no monument will be allowed or erected in the
cemetery. For purposes of this chapter, MONUMENT shall be defined as any
marker, memorial, statue or similar item which exceeds 30 inches in height
above normal ground level or which has a ground surface area exceeding 32
inches in width (or 60 inches in width for a double marker), with an overall
height of no more than 30 inches above ground level, including the foundation.
Only one marker or memorial shall be permitted per cemetery plot, or one marker
or memorial in total where two adjoining plots share that one marker or
memorial. Markers shall be no more than 32 inches in width (or 60 inches in
width for a double marker), with an overall height of no more than 30 inches
above ground level, including the foundation.
