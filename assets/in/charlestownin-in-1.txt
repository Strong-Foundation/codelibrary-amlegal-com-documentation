§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “City of Charleston
Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances,” or
“code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

(I.C. 1-1-4-5)
§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.

refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication

shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way,
contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance, establishment or

determination or action.
      (2)   Initiating an appeal.
         (a)   Any aggrieved party wishing to initiate an appeal must do so by
delivering a written notice of an appeal within ten business days of the time
that proper notice of any penalty or enforcement action is provided (in any
permissible way) by a city official or enforcement officer. The notice of an
appeal shall be delivered to the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer at 304 Main
Cross, Charlestown, Indiana 47111 during regular business hours.
         (b)   A notice of appeal may be sent by U.S. mail, certified mail,

      (3)   Contents of notice of appeal.
         (a)   The notice of an appeal provided for above must be in writing
and shall be presented in at least ten point type or legible printing stating,
at a minimum, the following information:
            1.   The name of the aggrieved party;
            2.   The residence address of the aggrieved party;

official or enforcement officer described above occurred;

alleged to have occurred;
            7.   Each reason that the aggrieved party disputes, disagrees with

ordinance was violated, is requesting a reduction or waiver of a fine or
cessation of an enforcement action, or both;
            9.   The name and address of all persons the aggrieved party
intends to present as witnesses at the appeal hearing; and
            10.   A description of any documents or written proof the aggrieved
party intends to present to support the aggrieved party’s appeal.
         (b)   The form of notices should be liberally construed by the Board
as to form. A person pursuing an appeal can present the required information in
either enumerated paragraphs or in a written narrative format.
   (C)   Issues on appeal. The issues on appeal are limited to:
      (1)   Whether the aggrieved party is the party identified by the city

officer or city official shall be by a hearing before the Board, and would
ideally be conducted within 30 calendar days after the filing of the notice of
appeal, or as soon thereafter as convenient and practical under the
circumstances. The aggrieved party shall be sent a notice of the date, time and
place of the appeal hearing at least five days in advance of the hearing date.
   (E)   Presentation of case. The aggrieved party can choose to rely on the
information contained in the aggrieved party’s notice of appeal filed with the
Clerk-Treasurer or, alternatively, will be provided with a reasonable
opportunity to testify, present testimony November 8, 2022 by witnesses, cross-
examine adverse witnesses and present evidence relevant to the issues on appeal
at the hearing. The city official or enforcement officer shall also have those
rights.
   (F)   Appeal of Board action. Decisions of the Board may be appealed to the
County Circuit Court within 30 calendar days of notice of a decision being sent
by the Board to the aggrieved party. A party wishing to appeal the Board’s
final decision shall do so to the County Circuit Court in the City of
Jeffersonville, Indiana. Such an appeal is to determine if the Board’s record
contains evidence sufficient to support the Board’s determinations and is not
to be a trial de novo.

30.02   Rules of conduct
§ 30.01 COUNCIL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-4-6-5, there shall be a total of five Council
members on the Common Council, with four legislative districts. One
Councilperson shall be elected from voters in each of the Legislative Districts
and the fifth shall be elected “at large” by all voters in the city. This
results in each voter being able to vote for two Council members.
   (B)   The four legislative districts shall be designated as districts A, B,
C, and D, rather than 1, 2, 3, and 4, in order to avoid confusing legislative
districts with precinct numbers, to wit:
      (1)   District A, previously referred to as District 1, will follow the
precinct boundaries for Precinct 1. This district will have to total calculated
population of 2,043 residents.
      (2)   District B, previously referred to as District 2, will include all
of Precinct 2 but with the addition of three more contiguous areas, since
Precinct 2 only has a population of 983 residents. These areas will be: 1) the
portion of Precinct 3 that is north of Highway 403, with approximately 580
residents; 2) the Pleasant Ridge neighborhood from Precinct 3 of approximately
367 residents; and 3) the small portion of Precinct 6 that is within city
boundaries north of Highway 403 of approximately 75 residents. This results in
District B having a total calculated population of 2,005 residents.
      (3)   District C, previously referred to as District 3, will include the
remainder of Precinct 3 (approximately 692 residents), the remainder of
Precinct 6 within city boundaries west of Bethany Rd. (approximately 1,095
residents), and Precinct 4 minus an area referred to as the Parkwood Trace
Apartments (we have referred to it as the Parkwood Trace Apartments but it also
includes several census blocks surrounding the Parkwood Trace apartments,
having approximately 413 residents). This would result in District C having a
total calculated population of 2,200 residents.
      (4)   District D, previously referred to as District 4, includes all of
Precinct 5 (approximately 1,809 residents), the Skippers Ridge development (no
current residents), and the Parkwood Trace apartments (approximately 405 total
residents), for a total calculated population of 2,214 residents.
(Ord. 2005-OR-22, passed 12-5-2005; Ord. 2012-OR-15, passed 11-5-2012; Ord.
2022-OR-19, passed 10-3-2022)
§ 30.02 RULES OF CONDUCT.
   (A)   Rules of order.
      (1)   The Common Council specifies these rules as its rules of conduct of
its own meetings.
      (2)   If these rules do not address a given situation, Roberts Rules of
Order shall be the rule of default.

modify from time to time. It adopts, at this time, the agenda format attached
to the ordinance from which this section was codified as “Exhibit A.”

   (D)   Special meetings and workshops. A special meeting of the Common
Council shall be any meeting that is not held at regularly scheduled times on

in accordance with law. Each member of the Common Council, the Mayor and the
Clerk-Treasurer shall be personally notified of a special meeting, at least 48
hours in advance of such a meeting, by telephone, if possible, or by leaving a
written notice at the home address of the official, if telephone contact is not
practical.
   (F)   Workshop meetings. A workshop meeting is a meeting that is not a
regular meeting and that is held solely for the purpose of education, budgeting
or legal advice from the Common Council’s attorney. No official action, as
defined by I.C. 5-14-1.5-2(d), may take place at such a workshop.

investigative hearings with notice from the Clerk-Treasurer. The President of
the Common Council shall moderate the hearings with assistance from individuals

assign a number to each ordinance or resolution when it is filed at the office
of the Clerk-Treasurer and shall provide copies of all new ordinances and

Common Council, the Common Council’s attorney, the City Attorney and the Mayor,
at least seven days prior to the meeting where the first official action is to
take place.
   (K)   Introduction of ordinances. All proposed ordinances or resolutions
that authorize the appropriation or expenditure of city funds shall be filed

proposed legislation shall be added as an item on the next agenda, or at a
subsequent meeting, if requested by the sponsor of the legislation.
   (L)   Procedure for adoption of legislation. At the meeting where the first
introduction of the legislation shall take place, the introduction shall be in
the following format.
      (1)   Readings required. An ordinance shall require three readings before

      (4)   Suspension of the rules and passage on the first reading. For a
matter to pass at the first meeting where it is introduced, a motion must be
passed by unanimous vote of the Common Council to suspend these rules and adopt

controlled substance test even if that applicant can verify that he or she has
previously participated in a drug testing program.
      (3)   All individuals applying for a transfer or new position with the
city must sign a release of information as a condition of employment. This
release is intended to permit the city to contact previous employers and
receive a disclosure all information concerning the employee, including but not
limited to alcohol/controlled substance testing results and insurance and
employment records.
      (4)   The city will incur all costs of one pre-employment controlled
substance test.
   (B)   Post-accident testing.
      (1)   Any employee involved in an accident, which does or could result
in:
         (a)   The loss of human life;
         (b)   The issuance of a citation under state or local law for a
violation arising from the accident; or
         (c)   An injury to any person which could require medical treatment,
either at the scene or away from the scene of the accident shall be subject to
be given a post-accident alcohol and/or controlled substance tests. The city
can order an employee to submit to post-accident tests after any accident.
Post-accident testing for circumstances other than listed above can be ordered
on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the Safety Director or his or her
designee. Employees must contact their immediate supervisor, the Safety
Director and/or any other designated city or department official as soon as
possible following any accident.
      (2)   Any employee who is involved in an accident and may be subject to a
post-accident test shall remain readily available for such testing. That
employee must make his or her whereabouts known to his or her immediate
supervisor and the Safety Director, for a period of eight hours following the
accident. Failure to do so will be regarded as a refusal to take a post-
accident test, if one may be required.
   (C)   Post-accident alcohol tests.
      (1)   In the case that an accident requires the ordering of a post-
accident alcohol test, the immediate supervisor and the Safety Director should
make every effort to arrange for the administration of an alcohol test within
two hours of the time of the accident. If the test is not administered within
two hours of the accident, then written record shall be made stating the type
of test, triggering event(s), reason(s) the test could not be completed and
where the test would have occurred if given.
      (2)   If the test is not administered within eight hours of the time of
the accident, then his or her immediate supervisor and the Safety Director
should cease attempts to have the alcohol test administered and make written
record stating the type of test, triggering event, reasons the tests could not
be complete and where the test would have occurred if given.
      (3)   An employee who is or may be required to take a post-accident
alcohol test shall not use alcohol for eight hours following the time of the
accident, or until after the post-accident alcohol test has been administered,
whichever is first.
   (D)   Post-accident controlled substance tests.
      (1)   In the case that an accident requires the ordering of a post-
accident controlled substance test, the employee’s immediate supervisor and the
Safety Director shall make every effort to arrange for the administration of a
controlled substance test within 32 hours of the time of the accident.
      (2)   If the test is not administered within 32 hours of the accident,
the immediate supervisor and the Safety Director should cease attempts to have
the controlled substance test administered and make written record stating the
type of test, triggering event, reasons the test could not be completed and
where the test would have occurred.
      (3)   An employee who is or may be required to take a post-accident
controlled substance test shall not use controlled substances for 32 hours
following the time of the accident, or until after the post accident controlled
substance test has been administered, unless medically necessary.
   (E)   Accidents resulting in serious injury/death of the employee. As a
condition of continuing employment, all employees of the city shall execute a
release authorizing the city to obtain/secure substances and/or information,
reports and documentation verifying the absence or presence of controlled
substances and/or alcohol in any situation where an employee involved in an
accident requiring a post-accident controlled substance and/or alcohol test has
sustained injuries that do not allow the employee to consent or submit to post
accident tests.
   (F)   Tests administered by other authorities. The results of alcohol or
controlled substance tests administered by federal, state or local officials
having independent authority to order such tests (i.e., law enforcement
agencies) shall meet the requirements of this section, provided such tests
conform to the applicable federal, state or local requirements and that the
results of the test are obtained by the employer.
   (G)   Section notes. Nothing in this section should be construed as to the
delay or deny any employee necessary medical treatment or to prohibit the
employee from leaving the scene of an accident:
      (1)   To obtain assistance in responding to the accident;
      (2)   At the direction of a law enforcement officer investigating the
accident; or
      (3)   To receive any required medical attention.
   (H)   Random testing.
      (1)   All safety-sensitive employees are subject to random controlled
substance and alcohol testing. Names of employees subject to random testing
will be entered into a pool and selected from that pool, at random, by a
scientifically valid method. Each employee has an equal chance of being tested
each time selections are made. Random selections may result in an employee
being selected more than once in a calendar year or not at all.
      (2)   Dates of future tests shall be unannounced and be treated as
confidential information.
   (I)   Random testing rate.
      (1)   The minimum annual rate at which the total employee population
safety sensitive positions (as defined) are randomly tested is 50% for
controlled substance use and the same as the DOT for alcohol use.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to determine whether controlled
substance and alcohol testing pools will be combined or chosen separately. If
testing pools are combined, then half of the individuals selected to be tested
for controlled substances will also be tested for alcohol. If testing pools are
chosen separately, then two random selections will occur. One selection will be
for those employees who are to be tested for alcohol and the other selection
will be for those who are to be tested for controlled substances. The random
nature of this selection process may cause an employee who is selected to be
tested for controlled substance to also be selected for an alcohol test.
      (3)   In accordance with DOT/FHWA regulations, the city will ensure that
an appropriate number of employees who operate commercial motor vehicles and
hold CDLs will be randomly tested for controlled substance and alcohol use.
   (J)   Employee notification.
      (1)   Employees will be tested just before, during or just after
performing job functions (i.e., sometime during their normally scheduled work
day.) If an employee who is selected for testing is on vacation or absent from
work either an alternate employee will be selected in his or her place or the
employee will be required to submit to the test when he or she returns.
      (2)   (a)   Employees will be notified that they have been selected to be
tested by the Safety Director or his or her designee. Employees selected to be
tested will not be notified until the day of the test, preferably immediately
before the test is to be administered. Once an employee is notified that he or
she has been selected for testing, he or she must immediately proceed to the
designated collection area and submit all required samples.
         (b)   Failure to proceed to the testing area or to submit required
samples will be deemed by the city as having refused to submit to testing and
will be cause for immediate termination of employment.
   (K)   Reasonable suspicion testing.
      (1)   All employees who hold supervisory positions within the city work
force shall attend a training course to become educated in recognizing the
circumstances which give rise to reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol testing.
      (2)   An employee must submit to an alcohol and/or controlled substance
test if a supervisor or the Safety Director has determined that reasonable
suspicion exists to believe the employee is under the influence of alcohol and/
or controlled substances.
      (3)   A supervisor or Safety Director must witness and document specific
observations relating to the appearance, body odor, speech or behavior of the
employee to determine that a test must be ordered.
      (4)   The city will bear the cost of a reasonable suspicion alcohol and/
or controlled substance test.
      (5)   While awaiting the results of a reasonable suspicion alcohol or
controlled substance test, the employee may be required to refrain from
performing any safety sensitive jobs and may be assigned to perform non-
sensitive duties until the results of the tests are received.
   (L)   Time for conducting reasonable suspicion alcohol tests.
      (1)   In the case that reasonable suspicion requires the ordering of an
alcohol test, the supervisor, Safety Director or his or her designee should
make every effort to arrange for the administration of the alcohol test within
two hours of determining that reasonable suspicion exists. If the test is not
administered within two hours, then written record should be made stating the
type of test, triggering event, reasons the test could not be completed and
where the test would have occurred.
      (2)   If the test is not administered within eight hours of the time of
determination, then the supervisor, Safety Director or his or her designee
shall cease attempts to have the alcohol test administered and make written
record stating the type of test, triggering event, reasons the test could not
be completed and where the test would have occurred.
      (3)   An employee who has been ordered to take a reasonable suspicion
alcohol test shall not use alcohol for eight hours following the time of
notification, or until after the alcohol test has been administered, whichever
is first.
   (M)   Time for conducting reasonable suspicion controlled substance tests.
      (1)   In the case that reasonable suspicion requires the ordering of a
controlled substance test, the supervisor, Safety Director or his or her
designee shall make every effort to arrange for the administration of a
controlled substance test within 32 hours determining that reasonable suspicion
exists.
      (2)   If the test is not administered within 32 hours that reasonable
suspicion exists, the supervisor, Safety Director or his or her designee shall
cease attempts to have the controlled substance test administered and make
written record stating the type of test, triggering event, reasons the test
could not be completed and where the test would have occurred.
      (3)   An employee who is ordered to take a post-accident controlled
substance test shall not use controlled substances for 32 hours following
notification, or until after the controlled substance test has been
administered, unless medically necessary.
   (N)   Return to duty/follow-up testing.
      (1)   Return to duty. An employee who has tested positive for controlled
substance or alcohol use shall test negative for controlled substances and
alcohol before being considered “re-qualified” for returning to duty. Both
alcohol and controlled substance return to duty test must be required, at the
recommendation and direction of a substance abuse professional (SAP).
      (2)   Follow-up.
         (a)   An employee who has tested positive will be subject to follow-up
controlled substance and alcohol testing upon returning to duty. Both alcohol
and controlled substance follow-up tests may be required, at the recommendation
and direction of a substance abuse professional (SAP). These tests shall be
unannounced and given at least six times in the first 12 months. The follow-up
testing may not continue beyond 60 months from the date of re-qualification for
duty and may be terminated at any time after the first six tests at the
recommendation of the SAP.
         (b)   The employee shall be subject to random selection testing in
addition to any follow-up testing.
         (c)   The employee must bear the cost of all evaluations, prescribed
treatments and return to duty/follow-up testing.
   (O)   Baseline testing. A baseline test is a one-time test performed on all
covered employees at the onset of random testing policy. All employees in
safety sensitive positions shall submit to a baseline controlled substance and/
or alcohol test. The city shall bear the cost of such testing.
(Ord. 2000-OR-02, passed 3-6-2000)
§ 33.23 TEST AND COLLECTION.
   Care shall be used to protect the integrity of the testing process, ensure
the validity of test results and ensure test results are matched with correct
employee. These procedures will be established by the Board of Public Works, in
cooperation with the testing company. The Safety Director or his or her
designee and the employee will be contacted by a medical review officer of the
testing company as soon as possible in the case of a failed test.
(Ord. 2000-OR-02, passed 3-6-2000)
§ 33.24 TEST REFUSAL.
   (A)   Refusal to submit. Refusal to submit to a controlled substance or
alcohol test permitted by this subchapter (policy) under any circumstance or
for any non-medical or non-emergency reason is strictly prohibited and is cause
for immediate termination of employment. Upon being ordered to submit a sample
for a test, all actions taken by the employee must contribute to the collection
of a sample. Upon notification, an employee may not continue to perform work
and must go directly to the collection site. Refusal to submit to a test
includes, but is not limited to the following acts:
      (1)   Failure to report to the collection site as directed;
      (2)   Failure to provide the required amount of specimen, i.e., urine or
breath (refer to division (B) below);
      (3)   Failure to remain readily available and notify supervisor of
whereabouts following an accident that requires or may require a controlled
substance and/or alcohol test;
      (4)   Any action that does not lead to the collection of a sample; or
      (5)   Any action or conduct that clearly obstructs the proper collection
of a sample.
   (B)   Inability to provide adequate sample.
      (1)   An employee who cannot provide an adequate sample for testing is
not “fit for duty” and shall not be allowed to continue working at any jobs
until an adequate sample can be provided.
      (2)   If an employee cannot or will not provide an adequate breath or
urine sample, the employee may be examined by a physician of the city’s choice
and a blood sample taken, at the expense of the city. If there is no medical
explanation for the inability to provide a sample, or if the employee refuses
to be examined by a physician, it will be considered a refusal to submit to a
test. If there is a medical explanation found by the physician for inability to
provide an adequate sample for testing, reasonable accommodation will be made,
at the direction of the physician, for collection of the sample.
      (3)   Until a cause for the employee’s inability to provide an adequate
sample is determined, the employee shall be removed from duties, without pay.

informed of his or her whereabouts following an accident will be considered to
have refused a test.
   (G)   Prohibited alcohol and/or controlled substance use following an

§ 34.16 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The city and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting Manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the city and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The city’s municipally-owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded at the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
      (1)   Assets acquired of a lump-sum price;
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract;
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease;
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of non-monetary assets;
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities;
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction; and
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
   (C)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has been long been recognized as a part of the asset
cost. Reference to an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the
recording of acquisition of assets under the aforementioned acquisition
arrangements. For purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost.
   (D)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detailed record of the capital assets of the
governmental unit.

utilities be in accordance with management’s authorization as documented in the
minutes;

assets at least every two years and appropriate action be taken with respect to
any differences.

Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   (1)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences.
      (2)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or

ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.110 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Board may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions (D) and (E)
below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Board may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Board and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders.
      (1)   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Board
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated.
      (2)   Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address
the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Board
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in division (G) below are initiated
against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (C) or (G) of this
section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (G)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in this chapter, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
52.020 through
52.026 of this code.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (B) above
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
Board shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. 2009-OR-06, passed 6-1-2009) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.111 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Board finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board may petition the court of the appropriate jurisdiction
through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Board may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
   (B)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Board may take any, all or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However,
the Board may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the Board is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.

§ 52.112 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (A), the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
         UPSET. An exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An UPSET does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(3) below are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
52.020(A) of this code or the specific prohibitions in §
52.020(B)(3) through (B)(18) of this code if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (C), the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
         BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of
a user’s treatment facility.
         SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of division (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (3)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit written notice to the
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under this division
(C).
         (b)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) above.

(Ord. 2009-OR-06, passed 6-1-2009)
§ 52.126 SEWER CAPACITY FEES.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      AVERAGE DAILY FLOW (ADF). As defined by 327 I.A.C. 3-6-11, which is the
flow rate requirements for collection systems and water pollution treatment/
control facilities.
      CITY. The City of Charlestown, Indiana, or representatives acting on its
behalf.
      COLLECTOR SEWER. A sanitary sewer of minimum eight inches in diameter
which receives sanitary sewage or wastewater from the individual service
lateral sewers.
      COUNCIL. The Common Council of the city or any duly authorized officials
acting on its behalf.
      DESIGN OCCUPANT LOAD. The number of persons that are intended to occupy a
building, or portion thereof, at any one time, based on the facility’s intended
use. The DESIGN OCCUPANT LOAD shall comply with the most current standards of
the state’s Building Code, 675 I.A.C.
      EQUIVALENT DWELLING UNIT (EDU). The equivalent of the sanitary sewage
flow produced by a single-family residence served by a single service lateral
discharging a base flow; that being established as 310 gallons of wastewater
per day.
      FLOW CALCULATION FACTOR (FCF). The recommended minimum daily sewerage
production per occupant unit, per occupant type, the same definition as defined
in Table 11-1 of 327 I.A.C. 3-6-11.
      MAY. An act that is permissive.
      PERSON. Any persons or entities, including any individual, firm, company,
municipal or private corporation, limited liability company, association,
society, institution, enterprise, governmental agency or other legal entity.
      SERVICE LATERAL SEWER. The branch from the collector sewer to the
residence or equivalent unit for the purposes of conveying sewage or wastewater
to the collection system for disposal.
      SEWER CAPACITY FEE. The payment required to be paid by a customer of the
utility for the purpose of allowing the utility to maintain and/or replace the
capacity of the sanitary sewer collection system and wastewater treatment
facility anticipated to be used by the customer. This charge applies to all
customers, including but not limited to each single-family residence, multi-
residential structures and commercial, industrial or government customers of
the utility.
      SHALL. An act that is mandatory.
   (B)   Sewer capacity fee. Beginning on the effective date of this chapter,
prior to the issuance of a preliminary plat, final plat or building permit for
any new structure, renovated structure, structure that is being used in a
different manner, or developments, a sewer capacity fee of $3,100 per
equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) shall be levied against a user connecting to the
city’s sewage works as follows. Likewise, if a structure is not altered, but
will be put to a different use which is anticipated to cause an increase in the
wastewater discharge to the utility, a sewer capacity fee will be required, as
described hereafter in this chapter.
      (1)   Calculation of EDU.
         (a)   Single-family residence. A single-family residential connection
shall equal one EDU, which is established at 310 GPD.
         (b)   Uses other than single-family residential users. All other
utility customers making new connections or changing the use of the structures
served by the utility shall pay a sewer capacity fee based on the equivalent
EDU or, in the case of changes, the anticipated increase in EDUs. The number of
equivalent EDUs shall be calculated by dividing the average daily flow (ADF) by
310 GPD, as described in division (B)(2) below. The ADF shall be calculated by
multiplying the flow calculation factor(s) (FCF) by the design occupant load
(see division (E) below).
         (c)   Changes of use. If the use to which a structure with an existing
utility connection changes, such that the ADF is likely to increase, or does
increase, the owner is required to pay an additional sewer capacity fee in an
amount equal to the difference in ADF between the previous use and the intended
(or changed) use, prior to the time that the new use begins. Any person that
intends to change the use of such a structure, or who does change the use of
such a structure, shall promptly notify the utility’s billing office, in
writing, on a form provided by the utility’s billing office, of the intended
change of use. Failure to provide such written notice is a violation of this
chapter.
      (2)   Calculation of sewer capacity fee.
         (a)   The sewer capacity fee shall be calculated as follows:
 
Capacity fee = number of EDUs x $3,100
 
         (b)   Final determination of sewer capacity fees for structures other
than single-family residential structures shall only be made after details of
the structure’s proposed use, area (footprint) and design occupant load have
been determined and submitted to the city for review.
      (3)   Previously paid fees. If a sewer tap-in fee or sewer capacity fee
has previously been paid, that tap-in permit shall be honored for a period of
ten years from the original date of payment. If not used within that time, the
tap-in permit will expire.
      (4)   Refunds; transfers. In all cases, a sewer tap-in fee and sewer
capacity fee is non- refundable and non-transferrable and shall remain with the
property or improvement for which it was issued and applied.
      (5)   Abandonment. In the event that a structure that has previously
tapped into the utility ceases to produce sanitary sewage flow and pay a usage
fee to the utility for a period of more than six months, before that structure
is allowed to discharge sanitary sewage to the utility the owner of the
structure shall pay an additional sewer capacity fee.
   (C)   Sewer tap inspection fee. In addition to the capacity fee, a separate
sewer tap inspection fee of $30 shall be paid by all customers connecting to
the city’s sewage works, for each tap (“Sewer Tap Inspection Fee”). The sewer
tap inspection fee shall be paid prior to making the lateral connection to the
city’s sanitary sewer facilities.
   (D)   Sewer disconnect/reconnect fee (service charge) $70.
      When water service is turned off for non-payment of bill, or whenever for
any reason beyond the control of the Wastewater Department a re-establishment
of service is required by any one customer, this fee will be charged by the
Wastewater Department to cover the cost of discontinuance and re-establishment
of service.
   The fee, together with any arrears due to the Wastewater Department, shall
be paid by customer before service will be re-established.
   (E)   Fines for non-compliance. A person who fails to pay any fee when
required by this section, or that violates any other provision of this section,
shall be subject to fines. The minimum fine for any violation of this section
shall be $25, with the maximum fine for a violation of this section being
$1,500. Each day a violation continues is considered a separate offense.

issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Board
may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,500. Such fines shall be

      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Board to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the

successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Board may add the costs of preparing administrative

of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for

other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.

into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   (1)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of

available under state law.

certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation

imprisonment, or both.

be subject to fines. The minimum fine for any violation of this chapter shall

premises, that a criminal offense was committed but that all of the occupants
of the premises were acting lawfully.
   (B)   It shall be a defense to the allegation that a person has maintained a
public nuisance if the owner or occupant of the premises can prove that when a
call for police assistance was made, and police were dispatched to the
premises, that the particular occupant of the premises was acting lawfully and
is the victim of a criminal offense.
   (C)   It may be a defense to the owner of premises if, within 15 calendar
days after nuisance behavior that is a violation of this section occurs, the
owner has instituted an eviction proceeding against the offending occupants of
the subject premises and the owner completes the eviction process of those
occupants within 75 calendar days of commencement.
   (D)   It may be a defense to an occupant (but not owner) if, in the case of
multi-unit dwellings, apartment buildings or mixed use buildings, there is
clear and convincing evidence that the only parties participating in the
nuisance behavior were not occupants of the premises where the nuisance
behavior actually occurred. However, this defense shall not apply if dwellings
are different structures.
   (E)   It may be a defense to an owner of premises if reasonable steps were
immediately taken to abate all nuisance behavior, including but not limited to,
removing the offending occupant, notifying police of violation(s) of criminal
laws and/or securing vacant property.

      (1)   Whenever a city official or enforcement officer becomes aware of
information that causes the city official or enforcement officer to reasonably
believe that a public nuisance exists on any premises in the city, the owner or
occupant of that property should be notified at the first convenience, with a
request that all nuisance behavior be immediately abated.
      (2)   However, failure of a city official or enforcement officer to
provide such a notice shall not be a defense against a finding that nuisance
behavior has occurred or is occurring, or that a public nuisance exists.
   (B)   Removal of notices. It is a violation of this chapter to destroy,
remove or deface any order or notice relating to a public nuisance that is
posted by a city official or enforcement officer prior to the time the
activity, event or hearing described on the notice has occurred.
   (C)   Notice of determination. Upon a determination made by the city’s

91.99
§ 91.06 CLOSE AND VACATE ORDERS.
   (A)   Close and vacate order. Should no appeal be initiated as set out in §
91.07 of this code, and if all of the conditions which have caused premises
deemed to be a public nuisance have not be fully abated within 30 calendar days
of service of the initial notice that the premises has been deemed public
nuisance, a city official shall be authorized to issue an close and vacate
order revoking any certificate of occupancy for the premises, thereby deeming
the premises unfit for habitation and further ordering discontinuation of
utility services to the premises. In such a case, the cost of utility service
disconnection/reconnection shall be borne by the owner and/or occupant of the
premises and not the city. These actions shall be for such period as the
enforcement officer reasonably directs, but in no event shall the action be in
effect for a period of more than one year from the original date a close and
vacate order goes into effect, unless further nuisance behavior continues.
   (B)   Rescinding close and vacate orders. A close and vacate order issued by
the enforcement officer pursuant to this chapter is not an act of possession,
ownership or control by city. A close and vacate order of the enforcement
officer should be rescinded within ten business days, or as soon thereafter as
practical, after reliable proof is provided to the enforcement officer showing
complete abatement of all of the nuisance behavior at the premises has been

remote food sales are hereby allowed within the city on properties that are
zoned residential and commercial, as well as on certain public property.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      REMOTE FOOD SALES. The sale of food and/or non-alcoholic beverages each
day by persons, firms, corporations and entities (“vendors”) at a single
temporary location from trucks, carts, trailers and other mobile means (the
“remote premises”). This term does not authorize sales of food in the city on a
single day in a vehicle moving throughout the city. This term does not include
caterers.
   (C)   Single-family residence or duplex. The provisions of this subchapter
are not intended to prohibit or restrict the ability of vendors to sell their
food or beverages on private property at the invitation of a resident,
provided, that the private property is either a single-family residence or
duplex, and the vendor is only selling food or beverages to the resident and
the resident’s guests. A vendor is required to obtain a permit prior to
engaging in remote food sales at these properties, but is not required to
obtain approval from the city or the City Building Commissioner.
   (D)   Other residential properties. Remote food sales are allowed on private
properties besides single-family residences and duplexes that are zoned
residential, subject to the other provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2020-OR-09, passed 5-4-2020)
§ 110.02 PERMIT.
   (A)   Annual permit. In order to engage in remote food sales within the
city, a vendor must first obtain and maintain a permit from the office of the
City Building Commissioner. The cost of a permit is $100 for the vendor’s first
vehicle and $50 for each subsequent vehicle used by the vendor for remote food
sales. This annual permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it is
issued.
   (B)   Application form. Within one month of the passage of this subchapter
the City Building Commissioner or his or her designee (the “Building
Commissioner”) shall develop an application vendors shall use to apply for the
annual permit. Such applications shall be approved, provided the application is
completed correctly and the application fee is paid.
   (C)   Application process.
      (1)   Applications for an annual permit shall be turned in to the
Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner shall determine whether an
application has been properly completed within seven days of the application
being turned in and any required criminal background checks coming back,
whichever occurs later.
      (2)   An application is not considered complete unless all required
fields in the application are completely filled out and signed, the permit fee
has been paid, the consent to criminal background check form is completely
filled out and signed, and proof of liability insurance is attached to the
application.
   (D)   Display of permit. The original or a copy of the annual permit shall
be displayed by a vendor in a conspicuous place on the vendor’s equipment, in
plain view of the public, at all times while open to the public.
   (E)   Nontransferability of permits. Annual permits are nontransferable. It
is unlawful to transfer, assign, sell or loan such permit for the use of any
other vendor to enable such vendor to engage in remote food sales without a
proper permit from the city.

110.99
§ 110.03 REMOTE FOOD SALES PERMIT.

vendor must provide proof to the Building Commissioner that the vendor has
obtained any required permits from the state’s Department of Health and the
county’s Health Department.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The vendor shall provide proof that it has
obtained commercial general liability insurance in an amount not less than
$100,000 by an insurance company licensed to do business in the state. Said
insurance shall provide liability coverage for the vendor against all claims
that have a reasonable likelihood of occurrence for property damage, food-borne
illness, personal injury or death arising from the operation of the remote food
sales operation. Proof of the vendor’s liability insurance shall be submitted
to the Building Commissioner at the time the vendor applies for an annual
permit.
   (C)   Criminal background check. All employees or representatives of the
vendor who work in the city must first undergo a criminal background check
prior to working at the remote premises. Said employees or representatives may
not begin working at remote food sales locations operated by a vendor in the
city until the criminal background check is completed and the results are
submitted to the Building Commissioner. The cost of conducting a criminal
background check is at the vendor or employee’s expense and is not included in
the annual permit fee.
   (D)   Sex offenders and convicted felons. No person convicted of any felony
or who has ever been required to register on any state’s sex offender registry
may work at a remote food sales location authorized by this subchapter.
   (E)   Proof of identification. Upon request by any law enforcement officer
or city official, employees or representatives of any vendor working at the
remote premises must provide proof of their identification.

PROPERTY includes any real estate owned or leased by the city, including but
not limited to streets, alleyways, sidewalks, walking trails, public parking
lots, schools, the City Square, City Hall and public parks.
   (B)   Approval of Building Commissioner. A vendor shall obtain the approval
of the Building Commissioner no sooner than 60 days and no later than two
business days prior to engaging in remote food sales on or at public property.
Such approval may only be granted if the vendor holds a current annual permit
with the city. A vendor may seek approval from the Building Commissioner to
engage in remote food sales for multiple days and at multiple public property
locations within the city. However, no one vendor shall be allowed to
monopolize any particular location.
   (C)   Public property request form. The Building Commissioner is hereby
authorized to develop an application form for vendors to request engaging in
remote food sales on public property locations.
   (D)   Maximum number of vendors. The Building Commissioner has the authority
to establish, in writing, the number of vendors that may engage in remote food
sales at a publicly-owned property venue on any given day, provided that said
minimum number must be at least one vendor per venue location. The Building
Commissioner may deny public property requests by vendors if said maximum
number is exceeded. If the Building Commissioner establishes a maximum number
of vendors for a public property venue, the Building Commissioner shall provide
those written determinations to the Common Council and to the general public
upon request.
   (E)   Sales on public streets. A vendor that has been approved to engage in
remote food sales on a public street shall serve any food and beverages to the
public on the side of the remote premises facing the sidewalk or grass. At no
time shall a vendor sell their food and beverages to the public on the side of
the remote premises facing a thoroughfare for vehicles, unless the thoroughfare
is closed.
   (F)   Sales at public parks. If a vendor is authorized to engage in sales at
a public park on a certain day and fails to show up for a good reason other
than inclement weather or serious illness, the vendor’s annual permit may be
revoked at the Building Commissioner’s discretion. A vendor may only engage in
remote food sales at a public park while the park is open to the public.
   (G)   Hours of operation. No remote food sales on properties owned by the
city may occur before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. Remote food sales on
commercial or residential properties may occur at other times as well.
   (H)   Overnight parking. A vendor shall not park or store their vehicle
overnight on public property without written approval of the city’s Board of
Public Works and Safety (“BPW”). This provision applies even if the vendor is
scheduled to engage in remote food sales on that public property venue on the
next day.

pursuant to this chapter and any applicable administrative regulations adopted
pursuant to this chapter.
   (D)   Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all at-
risk property that has at least one rental unit, except for units that are

   (E)   Registration of existing rental units. The owner of each rental unit

§ 151.02 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Authority to inspect. Rental units subject to this chapter shall
periodically be made available for an inspection by the Building Commissioner
or inspector for: Good cause; an annual housing inspection; re-inspections;
prior to the time that a new tenant/occupant takes possession of the rental
unit; or as otherwise permitted or required by this chapter or any other
applicable laws.
   (B)   Requirement to permit inspections. Every owner and/or occupant of a
rental unit located within the city shall, upon notice by the Building
Commissioner, permit the inspection of the rental units as required by this
chapter, as well as the real property on which such rental unit is located.
   (C)   Annual housing inspections. Every rental unit shall be made available
for an inspection by an inspector, without other cause, for an “annual”
inspection one time each year, upon at least 21 days’ notice to the owner and/
or occupant of the rental unit. The inspector may cause each rental unit to be
routinely inspected to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.
   (D)   Re-inspections. If, during any inspection of a rental unit any
deficiency or violation of applicable laws is discovered, the owner of the
rental unit shall permit an inspector to re-inspect the rental unit at any time
after at least 72 hours’ notice to the owner and/or occupant of that rental
unit.
   (E)   Vacancy inspections. The owner of each rental unit shall notify the
Building Commissioner, in writing, on a form provided by the Building
Commissioner any time a rental unit is vacated or will be leased or occupied by
a different occupant and shall provide an inspector with an opportunity to
inspect the rental unit, prior to the time the rental unit is occupied by a new
occupant. Failure of an inspection to take place within three business days
after the owner has proof that such notice form was received at the office of
the Building Commissioner, due to the unavailability of an inspector, will not
be cause to prevent the rental unit to be rented or occupied after that time.
   (F)   Complaint-based inspections. Nothing contained herein shall prevent or
restrict the authority of an inspector or the city’s other enforcement
officials to inspect any structure or premises on account of conditions
observed or other information received, indicating the existence of code
violations and/or violations of other applicable laws at such a property or
structure, and to pursue all code enforcement remedies permissible under this
chapter or other applicable laws following such a complaint-based inspection of
any structure or premise.
   (G)   Voluntary inspection requests. Any owner or occupant may voluntarily
request an inspection pursuant to this chapter to determine whether a rental
unit complies with applicable laws, even if such an inspection may not yet be
otherwise due pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. Such voluntary
inspection requests shall be conducted at no cost as the Building Commissioner
is available. However, such an inspection should be completed within ten
business days if an inspection fee of $25 is paid.
   (H)   Immediate health and safety threats. Nothing in this chapter shall
limit the city’s ability to inspect properties and institute enforcement action
for property-related conditions that may constitute a violation of other laws,
statutes, ordinances or regulations, or which pose an immediate health or
safety threat.
   (I)   Deficiencies. As soon as practical following an annual inspection,
vacancy inspection or re-inspection conducted by an inspector pursuant to this
chapter, the Building Commissioner should provide the owner and/or occupant
with written notice of deficiencies required to be remedied. A failure to
notify or give an owner or occupant of a rental unit notice of each existing
deficiency observed does not waive the right of the Building Commissioner to
enforce all applicable laws at a later time.
   (J)   Certificate of compliance. As soon as practical following an annual
inspection, voluntary inspection, vacancy inspection or re-inspection conducted
by an inspector pursuant to this chapter, if no deficiencies are noted, a
certificate of compliance should be issued to the owner and/or occupant of a
rental unit.
   (K)   Remediation of violations. Any violation(s) or deficiencies which
cause a rental unit not to receive a certificate of compliance after an
inspection conducted pursuant to this chapter shall be remedied within 30 days
of the time a notice of deficiencies is sent to the owner or occupant as set
out in division (I) above.
   (L)   Inspection fees. No fee shall be charged for an annual inspection
described above. A $25 fee shall be paid by the owner of a rental unit for each
re-inspection occurring because of deficiencies discovered during an
inspection. This re-inspection fee is a user fee, not a penalty. Likewise, a
$25 fee shall be paid by the owner of a new rental unit for vacancy
inspections.
   (M)   Failure to allow inspection. Owners and occupants of rental units
shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure each rental unit is made available
for inspection as required under this chapter. Failure to facilitate such an
inspection in accordance with this chapter shall be cause for the Building
Inspector to obtain an inspection warrant per I.C. 36-7-9-16. An occupant of a
unit that objects to an inspection hereunder should express that objection, in
writing, to the office of the Building Commissioner at 304 Main Cross,
Charlestown, Indiana 47111 within ten calendar days of receiving notice of an
inspection. Otherwise, if no objection is expressed by an occupant at that
time, then each day an owner or occupant does not permit an inspector to enter
a rental unit for purpose of conducting an inspection after notice has been
provided under this chapter is a separate offense.
   (N)   Presumption a rental unit is unfit for habitation. If notice of the
inspection of a rental unit is provided to an owner and/or occupant and no
objection to the inspection is made in a timely manner by an occupant of the
rental unit the inspector may perform an inspection. If an inspector arrives
for an inspection and is not permitted to enter for purpose of conducting an
inspection, when required by this chapter, the rental unit shall be presumed to
be unfit for habitation. In that case, after notice to the owner and/or
occupant of that rental unit, the Building Commissioner may order that utility
services to that rental unit be discontinued, until an inspector is allowed
access to the rental unit and an inspection of the rental unit is completed.
The cost of utility service disconnection/reconnection shall be borne by the
owner and/or occupant of the rental unit and not the city.

appeal such action(s). The issues on appeal are limited to: Whether or not
notice of an inspection was provided to the owner and/or occupant of the rental

reasonable efforts to ensure the rental unit was made available to an inspector
for inspection as required by this chapter; whether fines imposed were

   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Title. These regulations shall be known as the Property Maintenance
Code of the city, hereinafter referred to as “this chapter.”
      (2)   Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall uniformly apply to all
existing residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises
and existing or proposed improvements on existing premises and constitute
minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures, sanitation,
protection from the elements, safety from other hazards, and for safe and
sanitary installation and maintenance of improvements; the responsibility of
owners, operators and occupants for their properties; and for administration,
enforcement and penalties irrespective of when or under what code or codes such
buildings were originally constructed or rehabilitated, except for the rules of
the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission.
      (3)   Purpose. This chapter shall be construed to secure its expressed
intent, which is to protect, preserve and promote the physical and mental
health and social well-being of the people, to prevent and control the
incidence of communicable diseases, to reduce environmental hazards to health,
to regulate privately- and publicly-owned buildings, structures or improvements
for the purpose of maintaining adequate sanitation and public health, and to
protect the safety of the people and to promote the general welfare. It is
further declared that the purpose of this chapter is to eliminate blight, to
ensure maintenance of property, and to thereby ensure public health, safety and
welfare insofar as they are affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance
of structures and premises. Existing structures, improvements and premises that
do not comply with these provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a
minimum level of health and safety as required herein.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   General provisions. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to

matters governed by the provisions of the State Building Code, State
Residential Code, State Fire Code, State Electric Code, State Fuel Gas Code,
State Mechanical Code, State Energy Code, State Accessibility Code, State
Plumbing Code, State Swimming Pool Code, 675 I.A.C. 12, as the same shall be
amended from time to time. Where, in a specific case, different sections of
this chapter specify different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.

to create a private cause of action in favor of one party against another.
      (3)   Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a
structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be made or accomplished in accordance
with the procedures and provisions of the State Building Code, State
Residential Code, State Fire Code, State Electric Code, State Mechanical Code,
State Fuel Gas Code, State Energy Code, State Accessibility Code, State
Plumbing Code and/or State Swimming Pool Code, 675 I.A.C. 12, as same may be
amended from time to time.
      (4)   Existing remedies. The provisions in this chapter shall not be
construed to abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its
officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure,
which is dangerous or unsafe.
      (5)   Workmanship. Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or
installations which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of
this chapter shall be executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and
installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
      (6)   Requirements not covered by code. The authority having jurisdiction
thereof shall determine requirements necessary for the strength, stability or
proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or equipment or for the
public safety, health and general welfare, not specifically covered by the Fire
Prevention and Building Safety Commission and this chapter.
      (7)   Proposed improvements. Any proposed improvements or maintenance
thereto shall be designed, permitted, installed and maintained in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter and the current city standards that govern
the work associated with the installation or maintenance of such improvements
that may be amended from time to time. Where, in a specific case, different
sections of this and other applicable codes, or those codes of other federal,
state or local government agencies that have jurisdiction over the installation
or maintenance of such improvements, specify different requirements, the Fire
Prevention and Building Safety Commission regulations shall govern.
   (C)   Code enforcement.
      (1)   General. Property maintenance inspections as required by this
chapter shall be the responsibility of the city and other such persons as shall
be designated by the city, hereinafter referred to as “Code Enforcement
Official.”

the enforcement of this chapter shall be engaged in, or directly or indirectly

city, or the preparation of construction documents thereof, unless he or she is
the owner of the building.
      (3)   Liability.
         (a)   The Code Enforcement Official, officer or employee charged with
the enforcement of this chapter, while acting under its jurisdiction, shall not
thereby be rendered liable personally, and is hereby relieved from all personal
liability for any damage accruing to persons or property as a result of an act
required or permitted in the discharge of official duties.
         (b)   Any suit instituted against any official or employee because of
an act performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties

representative of the jurisdiction until the final termination of the
proceedings. The Code Official or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs
in an action, suit or proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the
provisions of this chapter; and any official of the city, acting in good faith
and without malice, shall be free from liability for acts performed under any
of its provisions or by reason of any act or omission in the performance of
official duties in connection therewith.
   (D)   Duties and powers of Code Enforcement Official.
      (1)   General. The Code Enforcement Official shall enforce the provisions
of this chapter.
      (2)   Inspections. The Code Enforcement Official shall make all of the
necessary inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved
agencies or individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing
and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the
responsible individual. The Code Enforcement Official is authorized to engage
such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues
that arise, subject to the approval of the city.
      (3)   Right of entry. The Code Enforcement Official, pursuant to this
chapter, may make inspections of all buildings, structures and premises located
within the city’s corporate limits to determine their compliance with the
provisions of this chapter. Such inspections shall be made between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day except Sunday. All inspections shall be
subject to the following standards and conditions.
         (a)   An inspection of an interior of a structure may take place only
if a complaint has been received by the city and such complaint, in the opinion
of the Code Enforcement Official, provides reasonable grounds for the belief
that a violation exists, or if such inspection is undertaken as part of a
regular inspection program whereby certain areas of the city are being
inspected in their entirety at the direction of the Board of Public Works and
Safety.
         (b)   The Code Enforcement Official shall furnish to the owner, tenant
or occupant of the building, structure or premises sought to be inspected
sufficient identification and information to enable the owner, tenant or
occupant to determine the purpose of the inspection and that the person is a
representative of the city.
         (c)   The Code Enforcement Official may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction for a search warrant or other legal process for the
purpose of securing entry to any premises if the owner, tenant or occupant
shall refuse to grant entry and shall request a city police officer to
accompany him or her to the premises.
   (E)   Approval of modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties
involved in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Code Enforcement
Official shall have the authority, upon approval of the Board of Public Works
and Safety, to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the Code
Enforcement Official shall first find that the practical difficulty makes the
strict letter of this chapter impractical and the modification is in compliance
with the intent and purpose of this chapter and that such modification does not
lessen health, life and fire safety requirements or modify the rules of the
Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission. The details of action granting
modification shall be recorded and entered in the department files.
   (F)   Violations.
      (1)   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or
corporation to be in conflict with or in violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter.
      (2)   Notice of violation. The Code Enforcement Official shall serve a
notice of violation and request for abatement in accordance with divisions (G)
(3) and (G)(4) below.
      (3)   Prosecution of violation. Any person failing to comply with a
notice of violation and request for abatement served in accordance with
divisions (G)(3) and (G)(4) below shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this
chapter and the violation shall be deemed a strict liability offense. If the
notice of violation is not complied with, the Code Enforcement Official shall
cause to be instituted the appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to
restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to require the removal or
termination of the unlawful occupancy of the structure in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or of the order or direction made pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Abatement of violation.
         (a)   The imposition of the penalties prescribed in §
152.99 of this code shall not preclude the city from instituting appropriate
action to restrain, correct or abate a violation in the city, county or state.
         (b)   The city may direct the owner or responsible party to restore
all improvements to the original design condition, alter the improvement to
remedy the violation, or remove the improvement if determined to be in
violation or represents the potential to be in violation of this chapter.
Violations shall be remedied to the satisfaction of the city.
         (c)   In the event that the owner or responsible party fails to remedy
the violation within the time frame stipulated in the notice, the city reserves
the right to remedy the violation and collect such costs together with
reasonable attorneys’ fees, consultant fees and collection fees, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, by suing the owner or responsible party in a court
of competent jurisdiction or in the alternate, by certifying said costs of
correction as any other special assessment upon the premises from which said
remedy of said violation was made.
   (G)   Notice and orders.
      (1)   Warning citation. It is the policy of the city to use fair and
reasonable judgment in the administration of its enforcement actions. To this
end, a warning citation may be issued for a violation of this chapter. The
warning citation shall be worded so as to sufficiently identify the premises
and the nature of the violation. If the premises owner or person being cited
fails to correct the violation in the time allotted by a Code Enforcement
Official, then a notice of correction order shall be issued. In his or her
discretion, a Code Enforcement Official shall have the right to forego issuing
a warning citation and may proceed to issue a notice of correction order. The
issuance of a warning citation shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of a
notice of correction order. There shall be no right of appeal from the issuance
of a warning citation.
      (2)   Notice to owner or to person or persons responsible. Whenever the
Code Enforcement Official determines that there has been a violation of this
chapter or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, a notice of
correction order (“correction order”) shall be given to the owner or the person
or persons responsible therefor in the manner prescribed in divisions (G)(3)
and (G)(4) below. The city will take enforcement action only with the owner or
responsible party at the time the violation is identified.
      (3)   Notice of correction order. Such notice prescribed in division (G)
(2) above shall:
         (a)   Be in writing;
         (b)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;
         (c)   Include a statement of the violation or violations and section
(s) violated and why the notice is being issued and include a description of
the actions necessary to correct the violation or violations;
         (d)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable amount of time,
of at least ten days (excepting cases of emergency or safety concerns), but not
more than 60 days, from the time when the correction order is served, to make
the repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit, structure or
improvement into compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
         (e)   Include a notice containing the right to appeal the Code
Enforcement Official’s determination to the Board of Public Works and Safety in
accordance with division (H) below.
      (4)   Method of service.
         (a)   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy
thereof is sent by certified return receipt mail or hand-delivered by an
employee of the city.
         (b)   If these two means of service are attempted, but service is not
successful, notice may be given by leaving a copy of the notice at the dwelling
house of the person to whom the notice must be given and sending the notice by
first class to the last known address of the person to whom the notice must be
given, in accordance with the provisions of I.C. 1-1-7-1.
   (H)   Means of appeal.
      (1)   Appeal to Board of Public Works and Safety. Any person aggrieved by
a determination of the Code Enforcement Official to the effect that a notice of
violation or order served in accordance with division (G) above is in error, or
should, due to hardship, be modified or entitled to a variance from
enforcement, or that a reasonable extension of time for the compliance should
be granted upon the grounds of a demonstrated case of hardship and evidence of
an actual undertaking to correct the violation, together with a legitimate
intent to comply within a reasonable time period, may appeal to the Board of
Public Works and Safety for rescission of the notice or order, or for a
modification, variance or extension of time for compliance. However, the Board
of Public Works and Safety shall not consider or grant modifications or
variance from any applicable rule of the Fire Prevention and Building Safety
Commission.
      (2)   Procedure and hearing. A request for rescission, modification,
variance or extension of time shall be made in writing, to the City Clerk-
Treasurer’s office, to be placed on the Board of Public Works and Safety

order. The Board of Public Works and Safety shall schedule a hearing within 30
days of receipt of the request.
      (3)   Open hearing. All hearings before the Board of Public Works and
Safety shall be open to the public. The appellant, the appellant’s
representative, the Code Enforcement Official and any persons whose interests
are affected shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
      (4)   Findings. Prior to ruling on an appeal, the Board of Public Works
and Safety shall make the following findings:
         (a)   The violator was served with a notice of correction order as
provided by divisions (G)(3) and (G)(4) below;

specific nature of the violation; the specific corrective action needed to be
taken to abate the violation; and a specific time period for abatement of
violation;
         (c)   Within the time period stipulated by the notice of correction
order, the violator failed to comply with the correction order by not abating
the violation, and/or not bringing the offending property into compliance with
this chapter;
         (d)   Upon expiration of the date indicated for compliance in the
correction order, the premises or structure was being maintained in violation
of specific provisions of this chapter and/or conditions imposed by Board of

      (5)   Board decision. At the conclusion of a hearing at which a
continuance is not granted, the Board of Public Works and Safety may reverse,
affirm or modify the order, notice, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as justice would require. The Board’s determination and findings of fact shall
be recorded in the Board’s minutes and if a notice or order is affirmed or
modified, the Board of Public Works and Safety shall, in the determination on
appeal, reestablish a reasonable time line to make the repairs and improvements
required to bring the dwelling unit, structure or improvement into compliance
with the provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   Court review. Any interested party having standing, whether or not
a previous party of the appeal, shall have the right to apply to the
appropriate court for a writ of certiorari to correct errors of law.
Commencement of an application for writ of certiorari must be filed in the
County Circuit Court within 30 days of the filing of the decision of the Board
of Public Works and safety in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer. There is
a 30-day limit to file an appeal with the court.
      (7)   Stays of enforcement. Appeals of notice and orders (other than
imminent danger notices) shall stay the enforcement of the notice and order
until the Board of Public Works and Safety rules on the appeal.
   (I)   Unsafe structures.
      (1)   General provisions. Unsafe structures shall be regulated and
enforced as provided by the city’s unsafe building regulations.
      (2)   Imminent danger. When, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement
Official, there is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or
structure which endangers life or other property, or when any structure or part
of a structure has fallen and life is endangered by the occupation of the
structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the building
occupants or those in the proximity of any structure because of explosives,
explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials,
or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the Code Enforcement Official
is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate
the premises. The Code Enforcement Official shall cause to be posted at each
entrance to such structure a notice reading as follows: “This structure is
unsafe and its occupancy has been prohibited by the City of Charlestown.” It
shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure except for the purpose
of securing the structure, making the required repairs, removing the hazardous
condition or of demolishing the same.
   (J)   Demolition.
      (1)   General. This division (J) shall only apply when demolition is
ordered pursuant to the enforcement of division (I) above.
      (2)   Salvage of materials. When any structure has been ordered
demolished and removed, the governing body or other designated officer under
said contract or arrangement aforesaid shall have the right to sell the salvage
and valuable materials at the highest price obtainable within 30 days of
demolition. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses of such
demolition and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report of such sale
or transaction, including the items of expense and the amounts deducted, for
the person who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of a court. If such a
surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so state.
   (K)   Transfer of ownership. No owner of any dwelling unit or structure or
improvement who has received a correction order or upon whom a notice of
violation has been served shall sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise
dispose of to another until the provisions of the correction order have been
complied with, or until such owner first furnishes the grantee, transferee,
mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any compliance order or notice of violation
issued by the Code Enforcement Official and furnishes to the Code Enforcement
Official a signed and notarized statement from the grantee, transferee,
mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such correction order or
notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility without condition
for making corrections or repairs required by such correction order or notice
of violation.
   (L)   Nonconforming conditions. If additional nonconforming conditions are
encountered during the course of any approved alteration or repair which were
not considered or known initially, the Code Enforcement Official shall have the
authority to require compliance with this chapter of such additional
conditions. The determination of what is necessary to bring such conditions
into compliance shall take into consideration the use of alternatives and
equivalent approaches as provided for in this chapter. The Code Enforcement
Official shall have the authority to approve construction changes in the field
when conditions are encountered which make the originally approved work
impractical, provided such changes in approved work can be readily determined
to be in compliance with this chapter and are requested by the owner or the
owner’s agent prior to such construction changes. Such changes shall be
specifically documented by the owner or the owner’s agent describing the change
in work and the reasons for justification for the change and shall be filed
with the permit for the project.

concurred in by the railroad company shall be furnished the commission for
approval as a part of the construction plan.
   (H)   (1)   All platted roads that have not yet been accepted for dedication
as public streets by the city’s Board of Public Works and Safety shall be kept
clear of accumulation of snow and ice so that they are readily passable by
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (H), it will be presumed that:
         (a)   Developers of subdivisions located within the city, having
platted roads that have not yet been accepted for dedication as public streets
by the Board of Public Works on behalf of the city shall continue to bear
responsibility for maintenance of those roads; and
         (b)   Roads are not readily passable if there is accumulation of snow
amounting to more than two inches or more of ice amounting to more than one-
quarter inch.
      (3)   It is a defense that the road in question has been properly plowed
within the previous 12 hours, in the case of snow, or properly salted or
treated with an ice retardant chemical within the previous 12 hours, in the
case of ice accumulation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in the potential for loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, public expenditures
for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood
insurance program.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination
of both. In A ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as ZONE
A, ZONE AE, ZONES A1-A30, ZONE AO, ZONE AH, ZONE AR and ZONE A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99.
         (a)   Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event,
but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction
federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where
enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such
as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating
purposes.
         (b)   ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the federal insurance
administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to

subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary

bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will
include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new

incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA), LETTER OF MAP REVISION

effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in this
chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is

available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the county and
incorporated areas, and the corresponding flood insurance rate map dated April
16, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by

the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an “A Zone” on the
flood insurance rate map for the county and incorporated areas dated April 16,
2014 as well as any future updates, amendments or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the state’s Department of
Natural Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject
site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that
meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be
submitted to the state’s Department of Natural Resources for review,
subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the state’s Department of Natural
Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.09 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.

§ 156.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.12 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:

   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the city, the state’s Department of Natural Resources
or the state for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

   (A)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
156.44 or
156.46 of this code may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
156.44 or
156.46 of this code will require a permit from the state’s Department of
Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
156.41 of this code may be granted only when a new structure is to be located
on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (see §
156.28(C) of this code).
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the state’s Department of Natural Resources upon request (see §
156.28(C) of this code).
   (C)   Variance notification.
      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (D)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (E)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in §§
156.27 and
156.28 of this code, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

the extent possible.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 156.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
156.07 of this code, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the state’s Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the state’s Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure.
However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing
(lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows
construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-
boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the
floodway from the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
for the fill is required from the state’s Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
state’s Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the state’s Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
156.40 through
156.47 of this code have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be
less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
state’s Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 2014-OR-04, passed 4-7-2014) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
156.40 through
156.47 of this code have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.

§ 156.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the state’s Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment;
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the state’s Department of Natural Resources; and
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the state’s Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
156.40 through
156.47 of this code have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site; and
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
156.40 through
156.47 of this code have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than one fourteen-hundredths of a foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

§ 156.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All
violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for the city. All violations
shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $500.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (C)   Any person, firm, business or entity violating any provision of this
chapter shall be fined not less than $100 or more than $1,500 for each
violation or offense. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense.

agricultural use and are located within the city or that are subject to the
zoning jurisdiction of the city to continue in the operation of farming and
agriculturally related businesses without undue hardship.
      (2)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         AGRICULTURAL USE. The use defined by city zoning ordinances and
amendments thereto.
         CITY. The City of Charlestown, Indiana.

         PARTITION FENCE. As defined in I.C. 32-26-1.
      (3)   Discharge of firearms to defend livestock and property.
Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary previously enacted by the Common
Council, it shall not be unlawful for any landowner, or his or her family
members, employees or agents, to discharge a firearm on land zoned for
agricultural use, lying within the municipal limits of the city, or within two-
mile fringe zoning jurisdiction of the city, for the purpose of defending the
real property or personal property of the landowner.
      (4)   Partition fences. This section is modeled after I.C. 32-10-9 et
seq. It is intended that the provisions of this section be interpreted
consistently therewith, when the language presented is similar.
         (a)   Existing fences. All fences now constructed and used by
adjoining landowners as a partition fence on land that is zoned for
agricultural use, which land lies within the two-mile fringe zoning
jurisdiction of the city, unless specially agreed upon by such landowners,
shall be deemed partition fences and shall be repaired, maintained and paid for
as herein provided.
         (b)   Agricultural lands inside city zoning jurisdiction.
            1.   It shall be the duty of all owners of land that is zoned for
agricultural use, or those whose lands are directly adjacent to land that is
zoned for agricultural use, whose lands lie within the municipal limits of the
city, or within two-mile fringe zoning jurisdiction of the city, to separate
said land from adjoining lands by a partition fence to be constructed upon the
line or lines dividing or separating said lands whether said lands were divided
heretofore or may hereafter be divided.
            2.   Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, or in case no
division of said partition fence has been made between the landowners for the
building or repairing or rebuilding of such partition fence, then in such case
the landowner, whose land lies to the east of said fence, shall build the north
half thereof and the landowner whose land lies to the west of said fence, shall
build the south half thereof and if the landowner’s land lies north of the
fence to be built, rebuilt or repaired, he or she shall build, rebuild or
repair the west half thereof, and if the land lies to the south of such fence,
such landowner shall build the east half thereof.
            3.   If either of such landowners shall have constructed one-half
of any partition fence, other than the half prescribed in division (B)(4)(b)2.
above and shall have maintained such one-half of such partition fence for a
period of not less than five years, such landowners shall thereafter be
entitled to continue to maintain such one-half of such fence, notwithstanding
any of the provisions of division (B)(4)(b)2. above.
            4.   If any landowner fails to build, rebuild or repair such fence
after receiving notice as is hereinafter provided, the landowner shall be in
violation of this section, and the City Clerk-Treasurer may cause to be built,
rebuilt or repaired such fence as is hereinafter provided.
         (c)   Defaulting landowner; description of lawful partition fence;
floodgates across watercourses.
            1.   All partition fences shall be built, rebuilt, kept in repair
at the cost of the several landowners whose lands are enclosed or separated by
such fences equally according to the proportion thereof such landowner may have
along such line of fence. If any landowner, as defined in division (B)(2)
above, shall fail or refuse to compensate for the building, rebuilding or
repairing of his, her or their proportion of fence, any landowner interested in
such fence, after having built, rebuilt or repaired his or her portion of such
fence, shall give to the defaulting landowner, his or her agent or tenant 20
days’ notice to build, rebuild or repair his or her proportion of such fence,
as the case may be, and if such defaulting party shall fail to build, rebuild
or repair such fence within said time, such landowner shall then notify the
City Development Coordinator of such fact: provided, that where the fence
sought to be established, rebuilt or repaired is on a township line, the
complaining landowner or landowners shall notify the trustee of the township
wherein the lands of the complaining landowner or landowners are located of the
improvement he, she or they may desire made, and the City Development
Coordinator shall have jurisdiction of such matter, unless disqualified as
hereinafter provided, and may estimate the costs for such fence, building,
rebuilding or repairing the same, as the case may be, and, within a reasonable
time after being notified, the Development Coordinator shall make out a
statement and notify such defaulting party of the probable cost of building,
rebuilding or repairing such fence, as the case may be, and if after 20 days
said fence is not built, rebuilt or repaired by such defaulting landowners, the
Development Coordinator may build or repair such fence, as the case may be;
provided, that the Development Coordinator shall use only the materials for
such fences as are most commonly used by the farmers of such community.
            2.   A lawful partition fence shall be a straight board and wire
fence or a straight wire or a straight board fence or a picket fence four feet
high, a straight rail fence four and one-half feet high, a worm rail fence five
feet high, and all fences of every structure to be sufficiently tight and
strong to hold hogs, sheep, cattle, mules and horses; provided, further, that
if a ditch or creek crosses the division line between two landowners,
necessitating additional expense in the maintenance of the part over such
stream, if such landowners can not agree upon the proportionate share of each,
the Development Coordinator shall appoint three disinterested citizens who
shall apportion the partition fence to be built by each landowner; provided,
further, that in all cases where a ditch or creek forms, covers or marks the
dividing line, or any part thereof, of the lands of separate and different
landowners of this state so that partition fences such as are required and
provided for in this chapter can not be built and maintained on such dividing
line, then, and in all such cases, such partition fences shall be built and
maintained under the provisions of this chapter as near to such boundary line
as may be, and each landowner shall be required, on his or her own land, to
build a separate partition fence and to maintain the same at his or her own
cost: provided, further, that in all cases where partition fences, such as are
required and provided for in this section, cross any ditch or creek and, by
reason thereof, it is impracticable to construct or maintain that portion of
said fence as would cross said ditch or creek as a stationary fence, then, and
in all such cases, there shall be erected, in lieu of such portion of said
fence across said ditch or creek, and as a part of such partition fence,
floodgates or other similar structures, sufficiently high, tight and strong to
turn hogs, sheep, cattle, mules and horses or other domestic animals, and so
constructed as to swing up in times of high water, and such floodgates or other
similar structures shall be so built and constructed as to connect continuously
such partition fences: and provided, further, that if the building and
maintenance of such floodgates or other similar structure occasions additional
expenses and such landowners can not agree upon the character of floodgates or
other similar structure, or upon the proportionate share of the cost thereof to
be borne by each, the Development Coordinator, upon notice in writing from
either landowner of such disagreement and the nature thereof, shall appoint
three disinterested citizens of the agriculturally zoned areas of the city, who
shall determine the kind of structure and apportion the cost of such floodgate
or other structure between such landowners, taking into consideration the parts
and portion of such fence being maintained by each landowner.
            3.   The determination of a majority of such arbitrators of any
matter or matters submitted to them shall be final and binding on each
landowner. The compensation of such arbitrators shall be $2 each, which shall
be paid by said landowners in the proportion they are ordered to bear the
expense of such gate or structure. In case either or both of such landowners
shall fail to construct or compensate for constructing the structure determined
upon by such arbitrators in the proportion determined, within 30 days from such
determination, the Development Coordinator may proceed at once to construct
such gate or structure and collect the cost thereof, including the compensation
of such arbitrators, from such defaulting landowner or landowners, in the same
manner as is provided for ordinary partition fences, and such floodgate or
other structure shall be repaired, rebuilt or replaced in accordance with the
determination of said arbitrators.
         (d)   Expenses; construction and maintenance by city. As soon as the
Development Coordinator has had such fence built, rebuilt or repaired, he or
she shall make out a certified statement in triplicate of the actual cost
incurred by him or her in the building, rebuilding or repairing of such fence,

(Ord. 2005-OR-18, passed 9-12-2005)
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 157.35 INTENT OF DESIGNATION.
   (A)   The purpose of these designations is to provide greater design
flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the intent of the
zoning provisions of this chapter. The use of the planned unit development
zoning designation shall be encouraged when the use of such regulations
promotes a harmonious variety of uses, and/or provides for an economy of shared
services and facilities, and/or are compatible with surrounding areas and/or
foster the creation of attractive, healthful, efficient and stable environments
for living, shopping or working.
   (B)   The planned unit development (PUD) regulations and procedures may
apply to the redevelopment of presently developed lands, or the development of
open or vacant lands, and may apply to parcels of relatively small size as well
as large-scale developments and their relationship with other surrounding uses
and the overall characteristics of the area in which they are located.
   (C)   PUD regulations are intended to encourage innovations in land
development techniques so that the growing demands of the community may be met
with greater flexibility and variety in type, design and layout of sites and
buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open spaces and
other amenities generally enhancing the quality of life. PUD projects should
also encourage a more efficient use of land that reflects the changes in the
technology of land development so that resulting economies may accrue to the
benefit of the community at large.
(Ord. 2003-OR-14, passed 5-8-2003)
§ 157.36 GENERAL DESIGN PROVISION.
   (A)   Minimum area requirements. The minimum area required for PUD zoning
shall be a gross land area of three acres, provided, however, that no
commercial or industrial uses shall be permitted in a PUD containing a gross
land area of less than five acres.
   (B)   Location of PUD districts. The PUD District may be applicable to any
area where the applicant can demonstrate that the proposal will meet the
objectives of this subchapter.
   (C)   Intensity of land use.
      (1)   Because land is used more efficiently in a PUD, improved
environmental quality can often be produced with a greater number of structures
per gross acre than is usually permitted in a traditionally zoned district. The
Commission shall determine in each case the appropriate land use and density
for individual projects or sections thereof.
      (2)   However, the following guidelines shall be adhered to: The maximum
residential density for the overall project shall be five units per acre,
computed by comparing the total number of dwelling units to the gross land area
of the project.
(Ord. 2003-OR-14, passed 5-8-2003)
§ 157.37 LAND USE RATIOS.
   (A)   Commercial or business office. Commercial or business uses may occupy
up to a maximum of 20% of the gross land area in PUDs that are otherwise
residential.
   (B)   Industrial. Industrial uses may occupy up to a maximum of 10% of the
gross land area of PUDs that are otherwise residential or a combination of
residential and commercial.
   (C)   Recreational.
      (1)   At least 10% of the gross land area in a PUD that is primarily
residential shall be reserved as open space and/or recreational purpose and
shall not be covered by buildings, parking lots, driveways or streets.
      (2)   No more than 50% of this visible open space shall be covered by
water, exclusive of detention areas. Recreational spaces shall be common areas
dedicated for the public use. Sidewalks and pedestrian trails may be considered
as recreational areas, up to the extent of 5% of the total PUD gross land area.
(Ord. 2003-OR-14, passed 5-8-2003)
§ 157.38 PROPOSALS.
   Any person or group of persons may prepare a PUD District in accordance with
the procedures hereinafter established. A parcel or site proposed for a PUD
need not be under single ownership where the proposed development consists of a
group of structures or improvements capable of being developed separately but
in accordance with a single, unitary plan, and in which the separate owners
have given their expressed intentions to enter into such private agreements
between or among themselves as will facilitate their mutual enterprises and
assure its completion as planned to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission.

installation of all public improvements in the form of bonds or such other
assurances as are required in the normal procedures of platting pursuant to the
subdivision provisions of this chapter. The Plan Commission shall then approve
the final detailed plans by resolution duly adopted, upon an affirmative
finding that the final detailed plan is consistent with the approved
preliminary planned unit development as adopted and passed by the Common
Council upon rezoning. Having once approved the final detailed plan, the Plan
Commission shall have not further authority to review or act thereon, except as
to enforcement, any amendatory ordinance, or as hereafter provided for.
   (B)   The approved preliminary plan may provide for development of the
property involved in phases. If such phasing is included as a part of the
approval of the preliminary plan, the petitioner may submit partial final
detailed plans that correspond to the phases involved. Such partial final
detailed plans, when approved, shall be treated in the same manner as approved
final detailed plans for an entire planned development.
   (C)   The approved final detailed plan or phase thereof shall be stamped
“Approved Final Detailed Planned Unit Development” and be signed by the
President and Secretary with one copy permanently retained in the office of the
Plan Commission following recordation.
   (D)   Unless extended by the Plan Commission, approval of the first phase of
the final detailed plan shall be obtained within two years, and approval of the

return said land to its prior classification.
   (F)   In the exercise of continuing jurisdiction, the Development
Coordinator may from time to time approve only minor modifications of the
approved final detailed planned unit development in a manner consistent with
the approved preliminary planned development. Such modifications shall not
include any increase in density, any lessening of aesthetic treatments, any
alteration of frontage or building location, or any change in type of use, or
any change in access points.
   (G)   Approval of a final detailed plan shall expire after a period of five
years from the approved phasing of the preliminary plan unless the development
is 50% completed in terms of public improvements including streets, open space,
walkways, utility installations and sanitary sewers. The Plan Commission, upon
recommendation of the Development Coordinator, shall make determination of the
amount of completion. Following expiration of the final detailed plan, the city

reasonable public or semi-public purpose, including, but not limited to, the
allocation of land by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks, schools,
recreational facilities and other public and semi-public purposes. Such
covenants shall provide that if a governmental unit or agency thereof does not
proceed with acquisition of the allocated land within a specified period of
time, the covenants shall automatically terminate. If such termination occurs,
the petitioner shall then submit for approval by the Plan Commission a modified
final detailed plan for such land, otherwise consistent with the approved
preliminary planned unit development.
   (C)   The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any other
reasonable purpose, including, but not limited to, imposing standards for
development of property in a planned unit development. Such development
standards may include, but are not limited to, requirements as to the
following:
      (1)   Lot area;

(Ord. 2003-OR-14, passed 5-8-2003)
§ 157.61 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of orderly
zoning for the city that all uses and structures incompatible with permitted
uses or structures in each zoning classification be strictly regulated and
permitted to exist only under well considered land use controls. Inasmuch as
one of the purposes of such regulation and control is to bring all existing and
future land uses into conformity with present development standards or to
eventually discontinue the uses or structures, this chapter is necessary.
      (2)   The city has previously enacted legislation regulating the use of
land through ordinances and zoning maps, even recently by adopting ordinances
codified in this title. Those and other municipal zoning ordinances do not
reflect the current rulings of the state courts that are the policy of the Plan
Commission of the city, pertaining to uses of buildings, structures, real
property, lots or lands not conforming with zoning legislation enacted by the
city. It is deemed desirable to remove any doubt in the minds of users or
owners of any buildings, structures, real property, lots or land regarding the
proper exercise of their rights, obligations and standing in this regard, this
chapter confirming those matters is in order.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CITY. The City of Charlestown, Indiana.
      EXISTING USE. The actual present use of a building, structure, real
property, lot or land, regardless of the lawfully permitted use. It also
includes the use of a building, structure, real property, lot or land that has
previously been lawfully approved, but which is not yet lawfully permitted,
constructed, established or ongoing is not an EXISTING USE.
      NONCONFORMING USE. An actual use of a building, structure, real property,
lot or land, which use was lawfully in existence prior to the enactment of a
zoning regulation and which, pursuant to law and this chapter, is allowed to
continue after the effective date of the subsequently enacted zoning
regulation, even though the use does not comply with current applicable use
restrictions. Except as specifically permitted by this chapter, a use of
property that has previously been lawfully approved, but which is not yet
lawfully constructed, established and ongoing before a zoning regulation
contrary to that use is adopted, is not a NONCONFORMING USE.
      ZONING REGULATION. A zoning ordinance, zoning map, subdivision control
ordinance, any ordinance regulating the use of a building, structure, real
property, lot or land, or any amendment thereto, adopted by the Common Council.
   (C)   Regulation of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Nonconforming uses allowed. Except as specifically provided herein,
a nonconforming use may continue to exist, although such use would otherwise
not comply with applicable zoning regulations.
      (2)   Discontinuance of nonconforming use. Any time a nonconforming use
is discontinued for a period of six months or more, further use of the
building, structure, real property, lot or land shall conform to all current
zoning regulations. However, should the discontinuance of a small business be
caused by a major medical disability or disease of the owner thereof, this
period will be extended to 12 months before the use ceases to be a
nonconforming use.
      (3)   Change of nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is replaced by
any other use, the new use shall be required to conform to all zoning
regulations in effect.
      (4)   Expansion of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be
enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy a larger area than was occupied at the
time a zoning regulation which caused the building, structure, real property,
lot or land to become a nonconforming use is enacted. Likewise, such use shall
not be moved to another part of the building, structure, real property, lot or
land.
      (5)   Restoration of nonconforming use not permitted without a variance.
If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use is
damaged to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value immediately
prior to the damage, by fire, other casualty, natural disaster or any other
accidental reason, restoration or replacement shall be permitted; provided,
that any new construction shall comply with the current building construction
standards then in effect.
      (6)   General exceptions to lot size requirements. If a subdivision lot,
lot of record or series of contiguous units of land existing in a single
ownership and within the R-1 or R-2 zoning classification were created in
compliance with all applicable laws and ordinances in effect at the time of
their creation and have an area or dimension which does not meet the minimum
lot size requirements of the zoning classification in which the property is
currently located, construction of conforming uses permitted in the respective
zoning classification on the nonconforming lots is permitted, subject to
compliance with all other zoning regulations and requirements.
      (7)   Conveyance of nonconforming use. Nothing in any zoning regulation
shall be construed to limit the sale, transfer, other conveyance of property on
which exists a nonconforming building, structure or use, so long as such sale,
transfer or other conveyance does not otherwise violate the provisions of any
ordinance of the city.
      (8)   Repair or maintenance of conforming use on nonconforming lot.
Nothing in any zoning regulation shall be construed to prevent the repair or
maintenance of a pre-existing building or structure conforming as to use on a
nonconforming lot, so long as such lot did not become nonconforming in
violation of the provisions of any zoning regulation of the city.
      (9)   Buildings under construction. For any permitted construction or
designated use of a building or structure for which a building permit has
lawfully been issued and construction work has commenced prior to the effective
date of a subsequently effective zoning regulation is a nonconforming use,
provided the building or structure is completed and in use within one year from
the time the building permit is issued.
      (10)   Moved buildings. Should any building or structure be moved for any
reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the zoning
regulations for the location to which it is moved.
      (11)   Registration of nonconforming uses. The city may require the owner
of a nonconforming use to register the nonconforming use with the city’s Plan
Commission.
   (D)   Remedies permitted. In addition to any penalty that may be imposed the
city may seek to remedy a nonconforming use which is not allowed hereunder by
seeking injunctive relief, as well as any other remedy at law or equity.
