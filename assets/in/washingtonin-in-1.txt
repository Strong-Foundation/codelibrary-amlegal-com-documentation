codes, titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
Washington Code of Ordinances, for which designation Code of Ordinances,

previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:

so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or

refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date

liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.

be attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the
word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the

regarding the nature or extent of the error.

§ 10.12 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)

POLICIES
§ 34.50 CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The City of Washington adopts a fixed asset policy that is
effective January 1, 2004, and will be known as the “Capital Asset Policy.”
This Policy is to include fixed assets as well as infrastructure assets. The
Policy is being put in effect to comply with the provisions of GASB 34 and the
requirements of the Indiana State Board of Accounts. All provisions of GASB 34,
except retroactive reporting, will be implemented for fiscal years beginning
January 1, 2004. Retroactive reporting of general infrastructure assets will be
implemented for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2006, and all infrastructures
acquired after GASB 34 implementation will be reported on a prospective basis.
Assets that do not meet the specified threshold will be expensed in the year of
purchase. An inventory of fixed assets, excluding land, buildings and
infrastructure will be housed within the city's financial reporting system.
      (2)   The City of Washington is adopting this Policy to enhance financial
and operational accountability to the citizens of Washington and to all other
concerned constituents.
      (3)   The purpose of establishing a Capital Asset Policy is to:
         (a)   Comply with the standards of GASB 34.
         (b)   Maintain accurate records of all fixed assets that are
capitalized, including infrastructure.
         (c)   Increase accuracy and clarity of financial reporting.
         (d)   To better serve the citizens of the City of Washington and the
city's constituents.
      (4)   This Policy will only serve to classify all capital assets,
including fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting to the
Indiana State Board of Accounts.
   (B)   Definition of capital assets.
      (1)   CAPITAL ASSETS are to include: land, land improvements, buildings,
building improvements, machinery and equipment, vehicles, construction work in
progress, easements, works of art, historical treasures and infrastructure.
These assets are to have a cost of greater than $5,000. The cost of the asset
will include all expenses necessary to make the asset fully operational. Assets
acquired through lease purchase agreements that meet these specifications are
to be capitalized. This cost will be determined as the present value or
discounted value of the future stream of lease payments, and not the total
lease. Items that do not meet this definition of CAPITAL ASSETS are to be
expensed in the year the asset is acquired.
      (2)   Exceptions:
         (a)   Office equipment, which is custom fit to the needs of a
particular office, will be capitalized as a portion of the cost of the building
or area in which they are located. All other office supplies and equipment will
be capitalized if it meets the specified requirements for capitalization.
         (b)   Inexhaustible assets such as land, improvements, artwork,
statues, and the like, will be reported at cost.
   (C)   Classification of capital assets. Capital assets are to include any
item that falls into 1 of the following categories: land, land improvements,
buildings, building improvements, machinery and equipment, construction work in
progress, vehicles, easements, works of art and historical treasures. These
categories of capital assets are to be defined as follows:
      (1)   BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. Items which extend the useful life of the
building are to be capitalized, including remodeling, roofing projects, energy
conservation projects, and the like. These items are to be inventoried
including: project description, year completed, funding source and dollar
amount.
      (2)   BUILDINGS. All structures erected by the city for the purpose of
conducting business, providing service, or facilitating work to the citizens of
Washington. This includes all fixtures, and systems within the building, as
well as specifically designed equipment. This may also include all porches,
balconies, canopies, flagpoles, stairwells, fire escapes, patios, decks and any
other attachments that add to the value of the building.
      (3)   EASEMENTS. A specific land interest held by the city that entitles
it to a specific use or right to the land. Since an EASEMENT is a right to use,
they will not be reported in the financial statements unless they are owned by
the city.
      (4)   LAND. All lots, parcels, rights-of-way, easements, parks, police
and fire stations, and acreage owned by the City of Washington. This is to
include all bodies of water and natural vegetation, which is growing on these
properties.
      (5)   LAND IMPROVEMENTS. Items such as retaining walls, driveways,
landscaping, parking areas, sprinkler systems, fencing and other items that add
value to or may be considered an improvement in making the land ready for its
intended use.
      (6)   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. Includes furniture and machinery and
equipment. This may include items such as office equipment, furnishings,
appliances, earth moving equipment, construction equipment, communication
equipment, maintenance equipment, supplies, and the like. Items that do not
individually meet the established threshold of $5,000 may be aggregated for
capitalization purposes. This may include computers, library books, and the
like.
      (7)   VEHICLES. Vehicles will be inventoried.
      (8)   WORKS OF ART AND HISTORICAL TREASURES. These items are to be
recorded at historical cost.
   (D)   Valuation of capital assets.
      (1)   All fixed assets will be valued at the unit or system level. If
these costs exceed $5,000, they will be capitalized. Any expense pertaining to
the cost of making the asset operational may be included in this cost. This may
include the following:
         (a)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
         (b)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
         (c)   Damage payments;
         (d)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
         (e)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
         (f)   Insurance premiums during construction; and
         (g)   Transportation charges.
      (2)   Capital assets are to be recorded at actual cost, which includes
all expenses to make the asset fully operational. If no cost is available,
replacement cost or a historic cost index may be used.
      (3)   Fixed assets will be capitalized when they exceed the sum of
$5,000.
   (E)   Physical inventory and reconciliation policy. All capital assets will
be inventoried every year. A physical inventory will be the responsibility of
each department head to account for all capital assets at year-end, as well as
inventory items that are simply tracked and inventoried. The physical inventory
will include the following items: asset description, year of acquisition,
method of acquisition, funding source, cost or estimate cost and salvage value.
This information will be housed and updated in the city's Financial Reporting
System.
   (F)   Capital asset acquisition and obsolescence. Any newly acquired assets
with a value of $5,000 or more are to be reported on the asset form provided by
the Clerk Treasurer’s Office. Any assets with a value of less than $5,000 which
are no longer in use will be stricken from the printouts provided for each
office. Both reports adding assets and removing assets are due in the Clerk-
Treasurer's Office by the first Friday in January of each year.
   (G)   Capital asset disposition and transfer.
      (1)   A distinction will be made by the Clerk-Treasurer as to whether the
action is a betterment or a replacement. A betterment adds to or extends the
useful life of the asset. These costs are to be added to the current carrying
cost of the asset. A replacement requires that the asset be removed from the
books and a new asset be recorded at cost.
      (2)   Some situations may be considered to be part betterment and part
replacement. This requires determining the distribution of betterment and
replacement. Once the distribution is determined, the respective portions
should be handled in the usual manner for a replacement or betterment. In
situations where assets are traded, the asset is to be removed from the books.
If only 1 part of the asset is being disposed of, that asset must be removed
from the books using a pro-rata share of the cost.
   (H)   Infrastructure assets.
      (1)   All infrastructure assets are to be reported at cost. Cost may
include all costs necessary to make the asset fully operational. These costs
may include:
         (a)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
         (b)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
         (c)   Damage payments;
         (d)   Land preparation costs, demolition cost;
         (e)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
         (f)   Insurance premiums during construction; and
         (g)   Transportation charges.
      (2)   All infrastructure exceeding $5,000 will be inventoried.
      (3)   Implementation date and plan for retroactive reporting. All
provisions of GASB 34, except retroactive reporting is to occur for fiscal year
January 1, 2004. Retroactive reporting is not required until fiscal years
beginning January 1, 2006.
      (4)   Retroactive reporting will require obtaining historic cost of all
major infrastructure assets that were acquired before GASB 34 implementation
and after January 1, 1981. These costs may include all cost necessary to make
the asset fully operational.
      (5)   For infrastructure assets where no historic cost is available, a
cost index or replacement cost may be used. It is not sufficient to use
assessment cost for the purposes of retroactive reporting.
   (I)   Infrastructure record keeping requirements. The City of Washington’s
Street Department will be responsible for recording values of ail
infrastructure assets in excess of $5,000.

$2,000 replacement value. In addition, all erroneous or irregular variances,
losses, shortages or thefts of non-cash which occur more than one time in a
month and which the aggregate total is $2,000 or more replacement value shall

Mayor, Clerk-Treasurer and City Attorney shall meet to discuss the matter and

   (E)   All erroneous or irregular immaterial variances, losses, shortage or
thefts of cash or non- cash items shall be documented and resolved. The Offices

(Prior Code, § 35.13) (Ord. 12-99, passed 9-13-1999; Am. Ord. 11-2002, passed
9-9-2002; Am. Ord. 9-2004, passed 7-12-2004; Am. Ord. 22-2004, passed 11-8-
2004)
§ 35.04 USE OF CREDIT CARDS BY CERTAIN EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section that the use of credit cards shall be
limited to specific uses as follows: cards are to be used primarily for travel-
related expenses and for registration fees for conferences and educational
seminars. Credit cards may also be used for the purchase of goods and supplies
where a merchant charge account has first been requested, but cannot be
established for any valid reason or the purchase is a one-time purchase or
infrequent purchase where establishing an account would be an inefficient use
of time or resources. The use of merchant charge accounts remains the preferred
method of purchasing supplies, goods and services for the city. The cards may
not be used to intentionally bypass the normal accounting and claims approval
process of the city, nor used for personal purchases.
   (B)   The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to obtain credit cards for those who
occupy the following positions: Mayor, Clerk-Treasurer, City Engineer, Chief of
Police, Fire Chief, Street Commissioner, Park Superintendent, Water
Superintendent, Wastewater Superintendent, Electric Superintendent, Animal
Control Manager, Utility Office Manager, Building Commissioner and Director of
Information Technology. Issuance of cards to additional positions shall be
approved by both the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (C)   Said credit cards shall have a credit limit of $2,500.00.
      (1)   Upon approval by both the Mayor and the City Clerk-Treasurer,
certain department heads may be permitted to seek higher credit limits in order
to accommodate the training and lodging expenses within a specified department.
      (2)   Any such credit limit increase should be requested by the pertinent
department head in writing and shall be approved by the Mayor and Clerk-
Treasurer, in writing, on a case-by-case basis.
   (D)   Employees to whom cards are issued may permit use of the card by other
employees in his/her department. However, the department head or official to
whom the card is issued is responsible for ensuring purchases are authorized,
legitimate and appropriate, and is responsible for custody and security of the
card itself.
   (E)   The Department Head shall maintain an activity log showing the date,
amount and purpose of each charge, name and title of person who charged the
purchase and from whom the purchase was made. A log shall also track the
balance due and date and payment amounts on the account.
   (F)   The City is not permitted to pay sales tax. The card holder should
make every effort to avoid the payment of sales tax by presenting an Exempt
Certificate at the time of purchase. If the establishment will not remove the
sales tax after presentation of the Exempt Certificate, the SBOA will not take
exception and the City will pay the sales tax. Exempt Certificates are
available in the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. If any sales tax is assessed to the
account because the employee intentionally failed to present the Certificate,
the sales tax shall be paid by the cardholder and is not reimbursable to that
individual.
   (G)   Department Head and officials are responsible to personally pay
interest charges and all extraneous charges such as over-the-limit and late
fees. Employees should be aware of the time period between charge card
statement date, date of claim approval by the appropriate board or city
official and payment posting by the credit card company, and that at times this
can be an extended period of time.
   (H)   The purchase of goods and supplies authorized in division (A) above
includes purchases over the internet. Employees are cautioned though to
exercise appropriate judgment related to security and should buy only from
vendors whom they have otherwise scrutinized and deemed to be legitimate and
trustworthy.
   (I)   No city credit card may be linked in any manner to a personal internet
site or account such as Paypal, Ebay, Amazon, and the like.
   (J)   Original detailed credit card receipts must be forwarded to the
appropriate financial office, i.e. Utility office for utility departments and
Clerk-Treasurer for all others, within 48 hours of a purchase (or within 48
hours of returning to work in the case of travel). Original receipts will be
sent in with monthly credit card statements as per the normal claims process. A
photocopy shall be kept in the appropriate department. Credit card payments
will not be made on the basis of the account statement only.
   (K)   Travel-related expenses include hotel or motel rooms; hotel or motel
room charges for telephone calls pertaining to city business; meals, including
gratuities not to exceed 20%; gasoline for city-owned vehicle, parking and
registration fees for conferences and educational seminars. Non-allowable
charges include alcoholic beverages, room service (if the meal was included in
the conference or seminar), non-business-related telephone calls, in-room
movies and cash advances.
   (L)   Because purchases made with a credit card are paid to the vendor
outside the normal claims approval process, each department head shall provide
to the Board of Public Works each month a copy of the activity log (division
(E) above) coinciding with the claim to the credit card issuer which the Board
is being asked to approve. This copy shall be provided to the Clerk-Treasurer’s
office in time for it to be copied for the Board’s meeting.

§ 35.05 NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT.
   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and in
contracting with the city in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012, known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   On July 1,2012 the city shall have a Nepotism and a Contracting with a
Unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “Contracting with
a Unit by a Relative Policy”) and implementation.
   (C)   The City of Washington’s Nepotism Policy is hereby established
effective July 1, 2012, by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C.
36-1-20.2, and including all future supplements and amendments thereto which
become law from time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out
herein. In addition a copy of I.C. 36-1-20.2 Nepotism in effect on July 1 is
attached to the ordinance codified herein, the same as if set out in full.
   (D)   The City of Washington’s Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy
is hereby established effective July 1,2012, by adopting the minimum

part hereof as if fully set out herein. In addition a copy of the I.C. 36-1-21
Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy in effect on July 1 is attached to
the ordinance codified herein, the same as if set out in full.
   (E)   The Common Council of the City of Washington finds that both I.C. 36-
1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that
are “more stringent or detailed” and that more detailed requirements are not
necessary.
   (F)   The Common Council of the City of Washington further finds that a
single member of the legislative body cannot act for the body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body and therefore without such
authority by the majority he or she will not be in the direct line of
supervision. (See, I.C. 36-4-6-11 and I.C. 36-5-29-4).
   (G)   The Common Council of the City of Washington further finds that a
single member of governing bodies with authority over employees in the city
cannot act for the governing body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of
a majority of the body, when a statute provides that a majority is needed to
act, and therefore, without such authority by the majority the single member
will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the city are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the Nepotism Policy or the Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy may be
subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Contracting with Unit by a Relative
Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of either the Nepotism Policy or
the Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy may be subject to action allowed
by law.
   (K)   The policies created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:
      (1)   Posting a copy of the ordinance codified herein in its entirety in
at least one of the locations in the city where it posts employer posters or
other notices to its employees;
      (2)   Providing a copy of the ordinance codified herein to its employees
and elected and appointed officials;
      (3)   Providing or posting a notice of the adoption of the ordinance
codified herein; or
      (4)   Any such other action or actions that would communicate the polices
established by this section to its employees and elected and appointed
officials. Upon taking any of these actions these policies are deemed
implemented by the city.
   (L)   A copy of the provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 effective
July 1,2012 are incorporated herein by reference, the same as if set out in
full.
   (M)   Two copies of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, and as supplemented or
amended, are on file in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer for the City for
public inspection as may be required by I.C. 36-1-5-4.
(Ord. 9-2012, passed 6-25-2012)
§ 35.06 EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE.
   (A)   There is now established an Insurance Benefits Committee which shall
consist of the Mayor, the Clerk-Treasurer, certain members of the Common
Council, certain department heads, and a representative of the Clerk-
Treasurer's office and or employee benefits administrator, all appointed by the
Mayor each calendar year.
   (B)   The Insurance Benefits Committee shall closely monitor the cost of
providing health insurance benefits to city employees and their dependents with
a focus on keeping costs down while maximizing the wellness of employees and
their families. The Committee shall regularly make recommendations to the
Common Council regarding needed adjustments to the city's provision of health
insurance coverage to employees and their dependents and eligible former
retired employees, and the employees' and retirees' responsibility in the
provision of their health coverage.
(Ord. 7-2018, passed 7-9-2018)
§ 35.07 EMPLOYEE SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   The city may pay an employee an annual sick bonus for not using or
limiting the amount of sick time taken by an employee during the year. The
amount and parameters of the bonus shall be recommended by the Mayor and
presented to the Council and/or Board of Public Works. This bonus is subject to
review each year and if it is determined that it is appropriate shall be
included in the salary ordinance.
   (B)   For calendar year 2018, the bonus structure currently in effect shall
remain in effect, namely:
      (1)   If any employee of the city does not take annual sick time during a
given year, the employee shall be paid the sum of $480 with his or her first
pay in February of the following year. If an employee of the city uses any sick
time up to two days during the year, the employee shall be paid the sum of $240
with his or her first pay in February of the following year. If any employee
takes more than two sick days during the year, the employee shall not be
entitled to any additional compensation as referenced in this section.
      (2)   For future years, this bonus shall be considered by the Common
Council as part of the annual salary ordinances.
   (C)   For purposes of calculating the bonus stated in division (B)(1) above,
employees are permitted up to eight hours for obtaining medical procedures or
tests that are part of the well living program and these eight hours shall not
be counted against the number of days allowed for the sick bonus calculation.
In order for these hours to be exempt from sick bonus calculation, they must be
documented with an accompanying doctor's slip. Upon providing documentation to
the Clerk-Treasurer's office of having undergone a colonoscopy procedure as
required by the city's well living program, an employee will be permitted an
additional eight hours (for a total of 16 hours) which shall not count against
the number of days allowed for the sick bonus calculation.

§ 36.08 WASHINGTON TRANSIT DEPARTMENT.
   (A)   Procurement requirements. These are the procurement requirements for
the Washington Transit Department, a recipient of federal funding from the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) administered by the Indiana Department of
Transportation–Public Transit Section. This is prepared and approved in order
to ensure compliance with Volume I, Section VI of FTA Circular 4220.1E. This
section will apply to the Washington Transit Department only.
   (B)   Relationships. No employee, officer, or agent of the Washington
Transit Department or member of the Board of Public Works and Safety shall
participate in the selection, or in the award or administration of a contract,
if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict
would arise when the employee, officer, or agent; any member of his or her
immediate family; his or her business associate or partner; or an organization
that employs, or is about to employ, any of the above has a financial or other
interest in the firm selected for the award.
   (C)   Gifts and entertainment. All Washington Transit Department employees
are strongly discouraged from accepting all gifts and entertainment from any
party having or seeking to establish a business relationship with Washington
Transit. Even when gifts and entertainment are exchanged out of the finest
motives of personal friendship they can be misunderstood. To avoid both the
reality and the appearance of improper relations with suppliers, potential
suppliers or customers, each employee is prohibited from soliciting or
receiving gifts, gratuities or any other personal benefit or favor from
suppliers, potential suppliers or customers. Employees of the Washington
Transit Department may, however, accept gifts of nominal value or advertising
and promotional materials clearly marked with company or brand names.
Entertainment should not be solicited, but may be accepted if it occurs
infrequently; arises out of the ordinary course of business; involves
reasonable, not lavish, expenditures; and takes place in settings that are
reasonably appropriate and fitting to the employees, their hosts, and the
business at hand.
   (D)   Influence.
      (1)   All Washington Transit Department employees are prohibited from
having a pecuniary interest in, or deriving a profit from, a contract or
purchase entered into by the Washington Transit Department, except that this

customer as set forth in Appendix B: Non-Recurring Charges.
      (9)   The utility, or its lawfully authorized agent, shall have the right
to enter upon the premises of the consumer at all reasonable times, for the
purpose of inspection, also to disconnect service wires and shut off the supply

interference for the purpose of making repairs or changes in its machines or
lines, or any cause whatsoever, the utility shall not be liable for damages for
interruption or failure.
      (11)   Consumers not provided with separate service wires shall not be

complete record of the same shall be kept on file in the office of the utility.
      (13)   Consumers are especially requested to examine all receipts and
change and correct mistakes before leaving the office or at the earliest
opportunity. Any complaint or notices will receive prompt attention, which are

§ 50.04 BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Meters are read and bills are prepared and billed on a cycle basis.
Bills are due 21 days from the statement date. To all bills not paid on or
within 2 days after the due date, there shall be added collection charges as
follows: For electric, 10% of total.
   (B)   If bills are not paid within 14 days after due date thereof, the
service will be disconnected in accordance with division (C) below. A customer
may enroll in the level billing program as follows:
      (1)   As an alternative to billing for the actual amount of utilities
used each month, residential customers shall be given the option of enrolling
into the level billing program. Those residential customers so enrolled shall
be billed equal monthly installments during an 11-month billing cycle (level
billing period) commencing with the July billing every year, with the equal
monthly installments (level billing amount) determined by averaging the
previous 12-months’ bills at the same location. The equal monthly installments
(level billing period) may be adjusted at any time at the discretion of the
utility business office.
      (2)   The accounts will be reconciled with the June bill each year by
comparing the actual charges incurred during the level billing period, plus the
June charges, against the actual amount paid during the level billing period.
If there is a balance due, the balance must be paid by the due date on the June
bill. If an overpayment of the account has occurred, the overpayment will be
refunded, thereby starting the next level billing period with a zero balance.
      (3)   Enrollment by electing customers must be completed before June 30
or prior to the billing for electric customers’ July statement, whichever is
later. The customer must at all times be current with their utility bill in
order to participate in the level billing program, or their participation will
be terminated. Customers electing this level billing program remain subject to
all other rules and regulations of the Washington Municipal Utilities,
including but not limited to, those regarding late payments, penalties and
disconnection.
      (4)   Participation in the program will continue from year-to-year
without having to re-enroll.
      (5)   Customers may terminate their enrollment in the level billing
program by written notification to the utility business office and giving the
utility business office a reasonable opportunity to act on it. The account will
then be reconciled and any balance due must be paid upon termination.
   (C)   The city shall disconnect utility service in accord with the following
policies:
      (1)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid and any deposit required
has been made. It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, the next
bill will show a date for disconnection of service for the non-payment of
previous bill. The date of disconnection will be approximately 5 weeks from
initial bill.
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Request for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
   (D)   When service is disconnected a final bill is generated, and the
deposits will then be applied to the account. Then the customer will receive a
balance due bill. If after 60 days the bill is still delinquent, 1 of 2 things
will happen. If the customer has another existing open account, the delinquent
amount will be added to the account. Otherwise, a letter is mailed to the
customer informing them that they will be subject to collection proceedings
within 30 days of letter if final bill is not paid or satisfied by deposit.
   (E)   In every circumstance where utility service has been disconnected,
whether for nonpayment or at a customer’s request, a temporary disconnect/
reconnect fee shall be charged to the customer requesting reconnection in the
amount of $50 during business hours or $100 after business hours. The fee shall
be paid in full prior to reconnection.
   (F)    (1)   The deposits required for electric meters shall be as follows:
         (a)   Residential customer in good standing with Washington Municipal
Utilities: $100.00 for each meter installed.
         (b)   Residential customer with a history of a written off account or
delinquent account with Washington Municipal Utilities: $200 for each meter
installed.
         (c)   Commercial customer in good standing with Washington Municipal
Utilities: $150 for each meter installed.
         (d)   Commercial customer with a history of a written off account or
delinquent account with Washington Municipal Utilities: $300 for each meter
installed.
         (e)   Landlords in good standing with Washington Municipal Utilities
shall pay $25 for each meter installed.
         (f)   Landlords with a history of a written off account or delinquent
account shall pay $100 for each meter installed.
      (2)   Deposits are required at the time of turn on. Interest is not paid
on these deposits. When an account has been turned off and a final bill has
been generated and a balance is owed, the deposit is applied toward the
balance. If no balance is due, the customer will receive a check for the
deposit(s), UNLESS THE CREDIT AMOUNT IS LESS THAN $3 PER DEPOSIT. If balance
due is less than the deposit(s), the bill will be paid in full by the deposit
(s) and a check will be sent to the customer for the remainder of the deposit
(s) UNLESS THE CREDIT AMOUNT IS LESS THAN $3 PER DEPOSIT. The deposit credits
of less than $3 will be paid to the City Light and Power Operating Fund.

§ 50.05 INTERCONNECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   A customer desiring to interconnect renewable generation facilities
with the utility's grid for the purpose of offsetting the customer's electric
load shall complete an interconnection application and submit the application
to the utility for review. After receipt of the application, the utility shall
conduct such further inspection of the renewable generation facilities as the
utility deems necessary and approve or deny the application. If the
supplication is denied, the utility shall provide a written response to the
customer explaining why the application was denied. The utility is hereby
authorized to charge a reasonable application fee to offset costs involved with
reviewing the application, inspecting the renewable generation facilities, and
otherwise ensuring compliance with this section.
   (B)   If the interconnection application is approved, then the customer
agrees that no changes shall be made to the configuration of the renewable
generation facilities, as that configuration is described in the application,
and no relay or other control or protection settings specified in the
application shall be set, reset, adjusted or tampered with, except to the
extent necessary to verify that the renewable generation facilities comply with
the utility's approved settings.
   (C)   In addition to such other requirements as the utility deems necessary,
any renewable generation facility allowed to interconnect to the utility's grid
must comply with: (a) the National Electrical Code and the National Electrical
Safety Code, as each may be revised from time to time; (b) the utility's rules
and regulations and the utility's general terms and conditions for electric
service, each as contained in the utility's electric tariff and each as may
revised from time to time; and (c) all other applicable local, state, and
federal codes and laws, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
   (D)   For any approved renewable generation facilities interconnected to the
utility's grid, the customer shall install, operate, and maintain, at the
customer's sole cost and expense, the renewable generation facilities in
accordance with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers'
applicable Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric
Power Systems, as it may be amended from time to time. The customer shall be
responsible for protecting, at the customers' sole cost and expense, the
renewable generation facilities from any condition or disturbance on the
utility's electric system, including, but not limited to, voltage sags or
swells, system faults, outages, loss of a single phase of supply, equipment
failures, and lightning or switching surges.
   (E)   The customer shall operate any interconnected renewable generation
facilities in such a manner as not to cause undue fluctuations in voltage,
intermittent load characteristics or otherwise interfere with the operation of
the utility's electric system. At all times when the renewable generation
facilities are being operated in parallel with the utility's electric system,
the customer shall operate the renewable generation facilities in a manner that
no disturbance will be produced to the service rendered by the utility of any
of its other customers or to any electric system interconnected with the
utility's electric system. The customer's control equipment for the renewable
generation facilities shall immediately, completely, and automatically
disconnect and isolate the renewable generation facilities from the utility's
electric system in the event of a fault on the utility electric system, a fault
on the customer's renewable generation facilities, or loss of a source or
sources on the utility's electric system. The automatic disconnecting device
included in such control equipment shall not be capable of reclosing until
after sendee is restored on the utility's electric system. Additionally, if the
fault is with the customer's renewable generation facilities, such automatic
disconnecting device shall not be reclosed until after the fault is isolated
from the customer' renewable generation facilities.
   (F)   Upon reasonable advance notice to the customer, the utility shall have
access to any interconnected renewable generation facilities to perform on-site
inspections to verify that the installation and operation of the renewable
generation facilities comply with the requirements of this section and to
verify the proper installation and continuing safe operation of the renewable
generation facilities. The utility shall also have at all times immediate
access to breakers or any other equipment that will isolate the renewable
generation facilities from the utility's electric system. The utility shall not
be responsible for any costs the customer may incur as a result of such
inspection(s). The utility shall have the right and authority to isolate
approved interconnected renewable generation facilities at the utility's sole
discretion if the utility believes that: (a) continued interconnection and
parallel operation of the renewable generation facilities with the utility's
electric system creates or contributes (or will contribute) to a system
emergency on either the utility's or the customer's electric facilities; (b)
the renewable generation facilities are not in compliance with the requirements
of this section; or (c) the renewable generation facilities interfere with the
operation of the utility's electric system. In non-emergency situations, the
utility shall give the customer reasonable notice prior to isolating the
renewable generation facilities.

interests of the utility as a named insured, with insurance to protect the
interests of the utility as a named insured, with insurance carriers acceptable
to the utility, and in amounts not less than those reasonably determined by the
utility to be necessary taking into consideration the nameplate capacity,
configuration and type of the renewable generation facilities. The customer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the utility, the city, its employees,
representatives, agents and subcontractors form and against all claims,
liability, damages and expenses, including attorney's fees, based on any injury
to any person, including the loss of life, or damage to any property, including
the loss of use thereof, arising out of, resulting from, or connected with, an
act or omission by the customer, its employees, agents, representatives,
successors or assigns in the construction, ownership, operation or maintenance
of the customer's renewable generation facilities. If the utility is required
to bring an action to enforce its rights under this division (G), either as a
separate action or in connection with another action, and said rights are
upheld, the customer shall reimburse the utility for all expenses, including
attorney's fee, incurred in connection with such action.
   (H)   If a customer owning or leasing a renewable generation facility
produces more energy from such facility than the customer's electric load at
that meter, then the excess energy shall be purchased from the customer by IMPA
pursuant to the terms of a separate power purchase agreement between the
customer and IMPA. The utility shall own any meter used to measure output of
energy from the customer's renewable generation facility.
   (I)   It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to connect or maintain
the connection of a renewable generating facility to the utility's grid without
obtaining the utility's approval of an interconnection application. Any person
or entity found to be in violation of this section shall be fined not less than
$500, nor more than $2,500 for each such violation, plus costs. In addition to
the foregoing fines and at the utility's sole discretion, property where a
renewable generating facility is unlawfully connected to the utility's grid may
be disconnected from the utility's grid until an interconnection application is
approved. Every day that a violation of this section occurs shall constitute a
separate offense.

corrective action and shall constitute a lien on real estate. In no case shall
the charge be less the $100. In addition to the assessment of charges pursuant

   (C)   The Board of Public Works and Safety is authorized, after due
investigation, to order any persons to disconnect their roof or surface water
drainage down spouts from a sanitary sewer system where the connection of down
spouts causes a flood of the sewer system and results, or may result in
inconvenience and nuisance to other persons by virtue of water being forced
back up flooded sewers into basements and homes of other parties in that area.
   (D)   Whenever the Board of Public Works and Safety or its designated agent
has reason to believe that a sewer is being overburdened by virtue of
connection of down spouts, they shall give notice to the occupants and owners
of the premises of this fact, and notify them to disconnect the down spouts
within 10 days. If the owner or occupants fail to so disconnect the down
spouts, then in that event the city shall have the right to enter on the
property and disconnect the down spouts in order to abate a nuisance.

§ 52.118 CHARGES TO BE BASED ON VOLUME OF WATER DISCHARGED.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by
the city in the manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage
service shall be billed at the appropriate rates as set forth in §
52.117; except as is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make
proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown
on the records to be so consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction
of the city that the quantities do not enter the sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the city and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this section, the owner or other interested party shall at his or her expense
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determining of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or their liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of water from
another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event 2 or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water of water, and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's swage
system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of 10,000
gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that a
portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot
enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested party
shall at his or her expense install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to
the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the user
charge as may be equitable.
(Prior Code, § 52.118) (Ord. 2-89, passed 5-22-1989)
§ 52.119 CHARGES TO BE BASED ON STRENGTH AND CONTENT OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage, and shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sewage
system, in the manner and by the method as the city may deem practicable in the
light of the conditions and standing circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a sampling point, available
to the city at all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid; suspended solids in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid; or Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)
in excess of 35 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
 
UNMETERED USERS        Phase I Phase II Phase III
Industrial Surcharges
(per pound)
Suspended Solids       0.10    0.11     0.12

NH3N                   0.82    0.95     0.84
 
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and 5 day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the current addition
of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Waterworks
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation.
   (D)   TKN as referenced in division (B) above is an abbreviation for Total
Kjeldahl Nitrogen and is defined as a measure of organic nitrogen present in
wastewater.
   (E)   The rates set forth shall become effective on the following dates:
      (1)   Phase I: Includes 19.30% of increase in rates, exclusive of base
rate change and surcharges, effective April 1, 2002.
      (2)   Phase II: Includes additional 9.65% of increase in rates, exclusive
of base rate change and surcharges, effective January 1, 2003.

§ 52.120 METHOD OF BILLING; DELINQUENT BILLS.
   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city in the
manner provided by this code, or by any other applicable law or ordinance of
the city:
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. A customer may enroll in the level billing program as follows:
      (1)   As an alternative to billing for the actual amount of utilities
used each month, residential customers shall be given the option of enrolling
into the level billing program. Those residential customers so enrolled shall
be billed equal monthly installments during an 11-month billing cycle (level
billing period) commencing with the July billing every year, with the equal
monthly installments (level billing amount) determined by averaging the
previous 12-months’ bills at the same location. The equal monthly installments
(level billing period) may be adjusted at any time at the discretion of the
utility business office.
      (2)   The accounts will be reconciled with the June bill each year by
comparing the actual charges incurred during the level billing period, plus the
June charges, against the actual amount paid during the level billing period.
If there is a balance due, the balance must be paid by the due date on the June
bill. If an overpayment of the account has occurred, the overpayment will be
refunded, thereby starting the next level billing period with a zero balance.
      (3)   Enrollment by electing customers must be completed before June 30
or prior to the billing for sewer customers’ July statement, whichever is
later. The customer must at all times be current with their utility bill in
order to participate in the level billing program, or their participation will
be terminated. Customers electing this level billing program remain subject to
all other rules and regulations of the Washington Municipal Utilities,
including but not limited to, those regarding late payments, penalties and
disconnection.
      (4)   Participation in the program will continue from year-to-year
without having to re-enroll.
      (5)   Customers may terminate their enrollment in the level billing
program by written notification to the utility business office and giving the
utility business office a reasonable opportunity to act on it. The account will
then be reconciled and any balance due must be paid upon termination.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by the tenant or tenants, provided that the examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that the
office is open for business.
   (C)   Bills are prepared and billed on a cycle basis. Bills are due 21 days
from the statement date. To all bills not paid on or within two days after the
due date, there shall be added collection charges as follows: for sewer: 10% of
total.

   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various uses of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 2 years of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect [May 22, 1989].
The study shall include, but not be limited to analysis of the costs associated
with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users,
volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various uses or
user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of
its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing:
      (1)   The sufficiency of the revenues to properly operate the wastewater
treatment facility and all appurtenances attached thereto; and
      (2)   Maintaining proportionality among the user classes of the rates and
charges for sewage services.
   (C)   The studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city,
or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by the combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city
shall determine to be best under the circumstances. The city shall upon
completion of the study, revise and adjust the rates and charges as necessary
in accordance therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and
sufficiency of the rates.

objectives of this chapter are:
         (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly
owned treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
         (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly
owned treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment
works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works;
         (c)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may
be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their job and duties and
the general public;
         (d)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the publicly owned treatment works;
         (e)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost
of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment
works;

comply with our NPDES permit part III non-delegated pretreatment program
requirements. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Superintendent
for review, and shall be acceptable to the Superintendent before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City of
Washington under the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be
so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every 2 years,
the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Superintendent may require
any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
52A.13(F); and
      (4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (D)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Superintendent, and at such times as may be established by
the Superintendent. Such waste shall not violate §
52A.02 or any other requirements established by the City of Washington. The
Superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater
discharge permits.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require haulers of industrial waste to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Superintendent may require generators
of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The
Superintendent also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The
discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of
this chapter.
      (3)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Superintendent. The Superintendent may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The Superintendent
may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
      (4)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed 9 months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Superintendent.
   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report containing the information described in §
52A.13(A)(2(d) to (f). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production
rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or
other measure of operation), this report shall include the user’s actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must
be signed and certified in accordance with §
52A.10(F).
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   The city may require users of the treatment works, other than
residential users, to supply pertinent information on wastewater flows and
characteristics. Such measurements, tests, and analysis shall be made at the
user’s expense. If made by the city, an appropriate charge may be assessed to
the user at the option of the city.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Superintendent,
using the procedures prescribed in §
52A.13(M), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user’s operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least 90 days before the change.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52A.11.
      (2)   The CA may review your wastewater discharge permit under §
52A.11 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
52A.12(D) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Superintendent of the incident This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   Within 5 days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties', or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who they are to call in the event
of a discharge described in division (F)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Superintendent
monitors at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the Superintendent
samples between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (I)(1) need be submitted only
once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
52A.13(E). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52A.13(A), (C) and (D).
      (2)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of division (I)(1)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a 1-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in division (K)(2) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the Superintendent may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of 4 grab samples
where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, DO, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (L)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (M)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter and or discharge permit shall retain, and make available for inspection
and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by this ordinance and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of
Washington, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Superintendent.

§ 52A.14 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Right of entry, inspection and sampling. The CA or Superintendent
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the
Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
      (3)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accurately.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City of Washington designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Daviess
Circuit or Superior Court.

§ 52A.15 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Wastewater Superintendent’s inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Wastewater Superintendent, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted
at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR
2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available
to the public without restriction.

§ 52A.16 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Wastewater Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of
the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
significant noncompliance shall mean:
   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a 6-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.0 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 0.8 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other discharge violation that the Wastewater Superintendent
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public;

§ 52A.33 CHARGES TO BE BASED ON VOLUME OF WATER DISCHARGED.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by
the city in the manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage
service shall be billed at the appropriate rates as set forth in §
52A.32; except as is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make
proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown
on the records to be so consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction
of the city that quantities do not enter the sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the city and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this section, the owner or other interested party shall at his or her expense
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determining of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or their liquids into the city’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of water from
another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a
meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
of charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event 2 or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water, and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each case, for
billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user
and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the
number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served through
the single water meter.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city’s
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of
10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall at his or her expense install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the user
charge as may be equitable.

§ 52A.34 CHARGES TO BE BASED ON STRENGTH AND CONTENT OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage, and shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sewage
system, in the manner and by the method as the city may deem practicable in the
light of the conditions and standing circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a sampling point, available
to the city at all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid; suspended solids in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid; or Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)
in excess of 35 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
 
Industrial Users Limit    Additional Charge
Suspended solids 300 mg/L 0.25/lb.
BOD              300 mg/L 0.25/lb.
TKN              35 mg/L  0.84/lb.
 
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and 5-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the current addition
of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Waterworks
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation.
   (D)   TKN as referenced in division (B) above is an abbreviation for Total
Kjeldahl Nitrogen and is defined as a measure of organic nitrogen present in
wastewater.

§ 52A.35 METHOD OF BILLING; DELINQUENT BILLS.
   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city in the
manner provided by this code, or by any other applicable law or ordinance of
the city:
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. At the end of each year, each user shall be given a notice, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rates charged for operation,
maintenance and replacement for that user for the next year.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by the tenant or tenants, provided that the examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that the
office is open for business.
   (C)   As provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates or
charge shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which the rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the bill.

§ 52A.36 RATES AND CHARGES TO REMAIN FAIR AND EQUITABLE; CITY TO CONDUCT STUDY.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various uses of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 2 years of operation,
following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect (May 22, 1989).
The study shall include, but not be limited to analysis of the costs associated
with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users,
volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various uses or
user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of
its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing:
      (1)   The sufficiency of the revenues to properly operate the wastewater
treatment facility and all appurtenances attached thereto; and
      (2)   Maintaining proportionality among the user classes of the rates and
charges for sewage services.
   (C)   The studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city,
or a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by the combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city
shall determine to be best under the circumstances. The city shall upon
completion of the study, revise and adjust the rates and charges as necessary
in accordance therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and
sufficiency of the rates.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52A.50 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Wastewater Superintendent finds
that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Wastewater Superintendent and/or the Board of Public Works to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Superintendent may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions
(D) and (E) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Wastewater Superintendent may order a user
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Board of Public
Works and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 14 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be ordered discontinued
by the Board of Public Works unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that
a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’\'s past violations are
likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board of Public Works may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed $2,500. Such fines may be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In
the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 18% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user’s
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Board of Public Works to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Board of Public Works may convene a hearing on the matter. In
the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Board of Public
Works may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such
as notices and orders, to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions. The Wastewater Superintendent may immediately
suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Wastewater Superintendent may also
immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.
         (b)   The Wastewater Superintendent may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in division (H) below are initiated against the user.
      (2)   (a)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (C) or (H) of this
section.
         (b)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge. 
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in §
52A.12(F), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
52A.02.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) above
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
Board of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 5-2007, passed 6-25-2007; Am. Ord. 15-2007, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 52A.51 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Board of Public Works may petition
the Daviess Circuit or Superior Court through the City of Washington’s Attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The Board of Public Works may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to Washington for a
maximum civil penalty of $2,500 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Board of Public Works may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the city, which includes, but is not limited to the cost of
disposal of sludge if contamination prohibits its normal means of disposal.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution. I.C. 36-1-3-8 prohibits cities from prescribing
penalty for conduct constituting crime or infraction.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with Washington’s enforcement
response plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any
user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered
to take more than 1 enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 5-2007, passed 6-25-2007; Am. Ord. 15-2007, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 52A.52 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   Performance bonds. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to Washington, in a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to achieve consistent
compliance.
(Ord. 5-2007, passed 6-25-2007; Am. Ord. 15-2007, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 52A.53 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(3) below are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through property signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. (If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5
days.)
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
Washington was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.
         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably by expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and (4) below.
      (3)   Notification requirements.
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least 10 days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   Approval restrictions.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
above.
         (b)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) above.

GENERAL INFORMATION
§ 52B.001 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted in accordance with statutory authority granted
to the city under “Home Rule” and further is required by Phase II of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Stormwater program (40 CFR
Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999) authorized by the 1987 amendments
to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s
(IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s Construction Stormwater
General Permit (CSGP). Based on this authority and these requirements, this
chapter regulates:
      (1)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the storm drain
system.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the city.
      (3)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities directly
related to construction sites subject to this chapter.
      (6)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (7)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.
      (8)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems.
   (B)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Washington
Stormwater Management Ordinance. Once adopted, this chapter will supersede any
conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the city.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.002 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the city. No building permit shall be issued, and no land
disturbance started for any construction in a development, as defined in §
52B.005, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the city. Single-family dwelling houses and
duplexes in accepted subdivisions, and land-disturbing activities affecting
less than one acre shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also
exempt from this chapter shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the city as well as with applicable federal, State of Indiana,
and other local statues and regulations shall also be required. Unless
otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be
the most recent edition available. City capital improvement projects shall be
exempt from obtaining a permit but are expected to meet state, federal, and all
applicable technical requirements of this chapter and the City of Washington
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the city within a 2-year period prior to July 8, 2024 shall be
exempt from all requirements of this chapter that are in excess of the
requirements of ordinances in effect at the time of acceptance. Such an
exemption is not applicable to the requirements detailed in §§
52B.020 through
52B.026.
   (D)   The city has the authority to modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive
any and all the requirements of this chapter and its associated technical
standards document. A presubmittal meeting with the city may be requested by
the applicant to discuss the applicability of various provisions of this
chapter and its associated technical standards document with regards to unique
or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any initial
determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the city that may be based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.003 FINDINGS.
   The city finds that:
   (A)   Discharge of water from water bodies, roadways, structures, and other
property into the city’s sanitary sewer system has caused and will continue to
cause flooding and overloading to the sanitary sewer system and combined
sanitary overflow (CSO);
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the city will, absent reasonable regulation and-control, adversely
affect the city’s water bodies and water resources including CSOs;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the city will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
city’s water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the city. This chapter establishes methods for managing the
quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system and CSO.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to conduct all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 52B.009 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records,
engineering, CSOs, and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur, or
stormwater runoff amounts may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land uses permitted will be free from stormwater
damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer, representative, or employee thereof, for any damage that may result
from reliance on this chapter or on any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (B)   The words “approve” and “accept,” and their common derivations as used
in this chapter in relation to plans, reports, calculations, and permits shall
mean that city has reviewed the material produced and submitted by the
applicant or his or her agents for general compliance with this chapter and the
City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and that such
compliance would qualify the applicant to receive a stormwater management
approval or permit. Such an “approval” or “acceptance” is based on the
assumption that the project engineer has followed all appropriate engineering
methods in the design. Any stormwater quantity (drainage) or water quality
problems associated with the project caused by poor construction by the
contractor and/or poor engineering design or judgment, either on-site or off-
site, are the responsibility of the developer and the project engineer.
   (C)   Consideration, design, construction, and maintenance of safety
measures for proposed or existing stormwater facilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer, applicant, and/or the property owner. The city
and its officials and representatives shall not be responsible for maintenance
nor liability for any accidents.

proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;
      (6)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section and the Indiana Spill Rule (327 I.A.C. 2-6.1).
This requirement does not relieve discharger from notifying other entities as
required by state or federal regulations.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The city has the authority to periodically
inspect the portion of the storm drainage system and CSO under the city’s
control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and
discharges into the system. This inspection may include a screening of
discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters.
      (1)   If, as a result of the storm drainage system or CSO inspection, a
discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the city may inspect and/or
obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of the subject
discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Upon
request, the discharger shall allow the city’s properly identified
representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all hours
necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The City of
Washington or its properly identified representative may place on the
discharger’s property the equipment or devices used for such sampling or
inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to
enforcement action as described in §§ 52B.100 through 52B.103.
      (2)   Access to facilities. This section applies to all facilities that
have stormwater discharges, including all facilities associated with industrial
activity and/or construction activity.
         (a)   The city’s properly identified representative shall be permitted
to enter and inspect facilities as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this division (B), including the inspection of any sampling
and/or monitoring equipment installed at facilities. If a discharger has
security measures in place which require identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, then the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow representative access into and/or onto the facilities in
a timely manner. Under no circumstances shall any security measures delay or
inhibit the representative from performing inspections.
         (b)   Facility operators shall allow representative ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
         (c)   Representative has the right to set up at any facility such
devices as the city, in its sole discretion, determines to be necessary to
conduct sampling and/or monitoring of the facility’s stormwater discharge.
         (d)   Representative has the right to require the discharger to
install, at the discharger’s expense, all devices as the city, in its sole
discretion, determines are necessary to conduct sampling and/or monitoring of
the facility’s stormwater discharge. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
and/or sample stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum in
accordance with manufacturer’s specifications to ensure their accuracy.
         (e)   If the representative has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the city, the city has the
authority to inspect new development and redevelopment sites to verify that all
on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system are
in compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 52B.035 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the city. The city, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may
waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and
parcelization. Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention
requirements are provided under §
52B.036.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.036 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that some streams, drainage channels, culverts, and
CSO serving the city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff as well as
compensation for loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in §
52.005) located within the city. Release rate requirements, downstream
restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, and adjoining property impact
considerations rates are detailed in the City of Washington Stormwater
Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the city to discourage direct release of runoff from a new
development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in rare
circumstances, where a comprehensive watershedwide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the peak” analysis) adopted by
the city substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a
proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by the city include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.
   (C)   The city seeks to promote responsible development that effectively
addresses both the quality and quantity of stormwater, integrates green
infrastructure, and minimizes the adverse effects of stormwater runoff
resulting from development and expanded impervious surfaces.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.037 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual are consistent with the policy stated above.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.038 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by the city. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the City Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed relative to the
conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within
the latter casements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner
association.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a county-regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the Indiana Drainage Code.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.039 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without
the consent of the city staff, whose decision may be appealed to the city’s
body with authority to grant appeals of the city. All existing drainage
facilities shall have senior rights and damage to the facilities shall result
in penalties as prescribed in §§ 52B.100 through 52B.103. All utilities,
whether requiring a CSGP or not, must adhere to all stormwater regulations.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.040 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the city and
the commencement of construction activities, the city has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
Design and Construction Standards, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit. The owner/construction contractor of the site shall inform the city
after installation of any underground pipes and fittings prior to backfilling
to provide a chance for the city to visually inspect the installation prior to
infrastructure being buried.
   (B)   The city also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements.
   (C)   Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition,
in accordance with the designed and approved performance specifications for the
facilities, in addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures,
and shall not be subsequently altered, revised, or replaced except as approved
by the city. If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the
facility will be notified by the city and will be required to take all
necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct
the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as specified in the
notification letter, the city may undertake the work and collect from the owner
using lien rights if necessary.
   (D)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than 1 lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property
deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and
determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.
   (E)   Stormwater conveyance facilities may be donated to the city or other
unit of government designated by the city, for ownership and permanent
maintenance providing the city or other governmental unit is willing to accept
responsibility.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 52B.050 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The city will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP),
which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling
procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the city
that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land disturbing activities
resulting in the disturbance of 1 acre or more of total land area is subject to
the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both new development and
redevelopment. This subchapter also applies to disturbances of land that are
part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb one acre or more of total land area. This subchapter
provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting the
coverage requirements of IDEM’s CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 I.A.C. 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be 1 acre
or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the city, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§
52B.080 through
52B.088, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site.
   (D)   An individual lot located within a larger permitted project site, is
considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot
operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit and
stormwater pollution prevention plan approved for the larger project site. The
stormwater permit application for the larger project site must include detailed
erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots. In addition, the
builders of these individual lots are required to submit an individual lot plot
plan permit application along with a SWPPP for that individual lot prior to
receiving a building permit. Details of the permitting process for individual
lots and parcels are contained in §§ 52B.080 through 52B.088 and additional
requirements for individual lots may be found in the City of Washington
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the city in accordance with §§
52B.080 through
52B.088. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the city upon completion
of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a termination
inspection to be performed by the city. However, all persons engaging in
construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
subchapter and this chapter.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.051 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of 1 acre or more, the developer must submit to
the city, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a
narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least 3 years from the date the project permit is terminated.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the City of Washington
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.052 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
0.5 acre or more, 0.5 acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot
disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than 0.5 acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of 1
acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless
the lots are less than 1 acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the City of Washington Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer.
The methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with
the above-stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM’s CSGP. A copy of
the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.053 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the city and commencement of construction activities,
the city has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater
pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms
and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the city, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the City of Washington
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this subchapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
   (D)   Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater
quality measures should be implemented.
   (E)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the City of Washington
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

the city as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the city or within the 2-mile area around the city that
includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities,
resulting in the disturbance of 1 acre or more of total land area is subject to
the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both new development and re-
development, and disturbances of land less than 1 acre of total land area that
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common
plan will ultimately disturb 1 acre or more of total land area. In addition,
regardless of the amount of disturbance, the city reserves the right to require
pretreatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with
provisions contained in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling disturbing less than 1 acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale; or individual building lots within a larger
permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 I.A.C. 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the city in accordance with §§
52B.080 through
52B.088. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwatcr BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the city upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the city. However, all
eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this subchapter
and this chapter.

§ 52B.066 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs), to treat the Water Quality
Volume (WQv) or the Water Quality Flow (Qwq) stormwater runoff will be
filtered, and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be
removed.
   (B)   The project site owner must submit to the city a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMPs specified in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and
Maintenance Manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and
a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement
provided in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
providing for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be
recorded with the deed for the property on which the project is located. The
noted BMP(s) must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to
guidelines provided or referenced in the City of Washington Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. Practices other than those specified in the pre-
approved list may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the
performance and ease of maintenance of such practices will be according to
guidelines provided in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures
and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the
City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under “Hot Spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.067 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

   All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention
basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-
of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of
monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, adequate easement
width, as detailed in the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, beyond the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management
facility as well as a 20-foot wide access easement from a public right-of-way
to each BMP shall be provided.

(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.081 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   This subchapter applies to all development, or re-development of land, that
results in land disturbance of 1 acre or more. This subchapter also applies to
disturbances of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or
sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 1 acre or more of total
land area. Figure 1 is a flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval/
project termination compliance process for land disturbance of 1 acre or more
and can be found at the end of this section.
   (A)   General procedures.
      (1)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the city. The application will include a completed
application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater drainage
technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other
necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
52B.082. Three copies of each application must be submitted to the city. The
city may. at its discretion, require 1 or more copies be submitted to other
entities deemed appropriate by the city. Additionally, a digital copy of the
construction plans is required in a format accepted by the city.
      (2)   After the city’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the city and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been
received and review completed, the city will either approve the project,
request modifications, or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree
with or accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the city will
place the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
City of Washington Board of Public Works and Safety provided the agenda for the
meeting has not yet been advertised or published. If time for notification does
not allow, the project shall be placed on the following regularly scheduled
meeting of the City of Washington Board of Public Works and Safety. If the
project must go through a scheduled meeting, the city will furnish the
applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the plans and
accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting,
the city will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction
plans, or deny the project.
      (3)   The project site owner must notify the city and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the city shall be made in person, via
phone or through an email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form
of an online IDEM NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending
construction notifications submitted to the city and IDEM before the beginning
of construction, construction may commence. Once construction starts, the
project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terns and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities,
a certification of completion and compliance and as-built plans must be
submitted to the city. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all
temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a
notification shall be sent to the city, requesting a termination inspection.
The city, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify
that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of
the city’s stormwater ordinance and its technical standards and that the terns
and conditions of the permit. Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the
termination inspection checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a
copy to IDEM along with the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the city
under this scenario will expire 5 years from the date of issuance. If
construction is not completed within 5 years, an updated permit application
must be submitted to the city and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at
least 90 days prior to expiration.
   (B)   SWPPP review time limits.
      (1)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially complete before the
end of the 10th working day (for sites with less than 5 acres of land
disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority or the 14th working day (for sites with 5 acres or larger of land
disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the following
scenarios may play out:
         (a)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority
does not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether
the construction plan is substantially complete within either 10 or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or this chapter and the City
of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after the NOI
is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the land
disturbing activities of the construction project.
         (b)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority
notifies the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially
complete, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM until the review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination
concerning the construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter
and the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
         (c)   Unfavorable SW PPP. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a
conclusive unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan under
IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the City of Washington Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, the project site owner may not submit a notice of
intent letter to IDEM.
         (d)   Preliminary SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction
project, including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
The plan review authority reserves the right to perform a comprehensive review
at a later date, and revisions may be required at that time.
         (e)   Conditional SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
conditional review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction
project, including the land disturbing activities of the construction project
provided that the requirements included in the conditional review are
fulfilled.
         (f)   Favorable SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the City of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction
project, including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
      (2)   Note that the above time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.

§ 52B.086 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the city may impose such
terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of this
chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms and
conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
52B.100 through
52B.103.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the city may
require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed
in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
   (D)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
credible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
   (E)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
      (1)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage areas,
unless good reason for not including them is presented to the city:
         (a)   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the city’s system.
         (b)   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
      (2)   The city or the City Engineer is authorized, but is not required,
to classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining
impact drainage areas, the city may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the city. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
   (F)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The city is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or re-
development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the City
of Washington Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 52B.100 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   To secure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, violations
thereof shall be subject to the enforcement provisions set forth under §
52B.101 . Additionally, compliance with the requirements set forth in the local
zoning ordinances is also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances
of the city as well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations
shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications
referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition available.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of compliance with and enforcement of
this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
      COMPLIANCE. The act of correcting a violation or violations within the
time frame specified by the city.
      OFFENSE. Both a violation and a failure of compliance on a particular
project constitute an offense. If there are multiple violations or multiple
failures of compliance on the same project, each shall be considered a separate
offense as further stated in §
52B.101 (C).
      VIOLATION. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this
chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan or
permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance agreement
may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this subchapter. Any such
action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by
injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to and separate from the
imposition of any of the enforcement actions described below.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the city finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the city may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.101 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the city determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefor, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the city may impose upon a violator,
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, and the like.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a
civil infraction subject to a fine as shown in the schedule below for each
offense, plus costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or
continues without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the city may be
deemed a separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition
of a fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this subchapter
are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An
admission or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this subchapter.
      (3)   The city has established an enforcement response schedule as noted
in the table below that standardizes the approach that the city may, in its
discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to
this chapter and the associated Technical Standards document. When employed,
this schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the following manner:
The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while the subsequent
offenses 2 through 8 (as necessary) are failures of compliance.
Offense # Type of Response Anticipated
Offense #   Type of Response Anticipated
1st offense Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning and
            administrative penalty
2nd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
3rd offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
4th offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
5th offense Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
6th offense Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
7th offense Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
8th offense Litigation and administrative penalty
 
      (4)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the city may,
in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties, the
city has established the following schedule of administrative penalties. The
penalties shall be assessed on a per violation, per offense basis. The schedule
of penalties is summarized in the following tables: Again, the penalty for the
first offense would apply to the violation itself, while the subsequent
penalties 2 through 4 (as necessary) would apply to failures of compliance. In
its discretion, the city may impose penalties up to the amount specified in
this schedule for noncompliance with §§
52B.020 through
52B.026.

      (6)   Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate
violation. The city reserves the right to issue a maximum fine for any
violation deemed sufficiently egregious or otherwise determined by the city to
warrant a maximum penalty.
   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the city may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the city to proceed with the work. A stop work order will be
posted on the site by the city, and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the city. The
city may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any necessary or advisable
protective measures to prevent violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce
the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost of any such protective measures
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the work is
being done and the responsibility of any person carrying out or participating
in the work.
      (2)   The city may bring an action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work
order against any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the city, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The City Building Commissioner may
refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other
improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant
or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the
notice of violation or has otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter
as determined by the City Building Commissioner.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The city may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the city may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all chapter requirements and take such
appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division (G)(1) shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its
endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may commence court action
against such person under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-
6-2-86(1)(B) and I.C. 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
         (c)   The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city
within 5 days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease
and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
city may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this chapter, without the prior approval of the city.

§ 52B.102 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the city may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the city for all costs of such work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. Costs
include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage system made
necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by the EPA or
IDEM for violation of the city’s NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney
fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the city may commence a court action to
recover the costs assessed under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with
I.C. 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and I.C. 13-21-3-12(4).
(Ord. 10-2024, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 52B.103 APPEALS.

this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Board of Public Works
the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such appeal
shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the appeal. The
Board of Public Works shall consider the appeal and make a decision whereby it
affirms, rejects or modifies the action being appealed. In considering any such
appeal, the Board of Public Works may consider the recommendations of the city
staff and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In
considering any such appeal, the Board may grant a variance from the terms of
this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being
appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
this chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
      (3)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the appropriate board
may appeal an adverse decision of the Board to the Daviess County court within
60 days of the Board’s order, all pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9(e) and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within 5 days of the decision of the appropriate
board upholding the decision of the city, then representatives of the city
shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any
and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property,
including the commencing of a court action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b),to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-286(l)(B) and I.C. 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce the order
of the appropriate board.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND POLICY.
   The Council finds that the discharge of water from roofs, ground, paved
surfaces, sump pumps, footing tiles, swimming pools, and other real estate
improvements into the city's sanitary sewer system has caused and will continue
to cause flooding and overloading of the sanitary sewer system. Flooding and
overloading has caused and will continue to cause damage to the property of
city residents and creates a hazard to the health of city residents. The
Council further finds it essential to the maintenance of health, safety, and
general welfare of its residents that the discharges be prohibited and the
provisions of this section be strictly enforced.

§ 53.32 PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORMWATER’S USER’S FEE.
   (A)   Property classifications. For purposes of determining the stormwater
user's fee, all properties in the city are classified into 1 of the following
classes:
      (1)   Residential property;
      (2)   Non-residential property; and
      (3)   Exempt property.
   (B)   User fee determination. All owners of real property in the City of
Washington shall be charged a stormwater fee based on §
53.32(C) below.
   (C)   Initial billing.
      (1)   All property classifications except exempt property shall be billed
for 1 equivalent residential unit (ERU). As rapidly as resources allow, the
utility shall make a determination as to the multiple of ERUs to be assigned to
each property classification except exempt property. The determination shall be
made in categories based on customer classifications, in the following order:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   Non-residential; and
         (c)   Exempt.
      (2)   Once the determination of multiples has been substantially
completed for each individual category listed above, each and every property in
that category shall be billed according to their actual number of ERUs.
   (D)   Residential fee. The City Council finds that the intensity of
development of most parcels of real property in the municipality classified as
residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily
expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such
as buildings, structures, and other impervious areas) on each parcel.
Therefore, all single-family residential properties in the city shall be
charged a flat stormwater user fee, equal to the base rate, regardless of the
size of the parcel or the improvements.
   (E)   Non-residential property fee. The fee for non-residential property in
the municipality shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor
obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by
1 ERU or 2,558 sq. ft. The minimum stormwater user fee for non-residential
property shall equal the base rate for residential property. The maximum user
fee for a parcel block owned by the same entity is $108.75. Users will be
billed for each non-contiguous parcel block they own.
   (F)   Exempt property. There shall be no stormwater user's fee for exempt
property.

§ 53.33 BASE RATE.
   The City Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, establish the base rate
for the stormwater user's fee. The base rate shall be calculated to insure
adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater management and to provide for
the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the stormwater system
in the city. Subject to a future ordinance or resolution the City Council sets
the base rate for 1 ERU at $6.15 per month.

upward or downward the stormwater user's fees with respect to any property.
Non-exempt property ERU calculations are based on Daviess County Assessor's
information and will be checked on an annual basis, and changes will be based
on that information.

to wave action.
            4.   A safety ramp exit from the lake will be required in all cases
and shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope of 6 horizontal to 1
vertical (6:1). The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent its
deterioration due to vehicle use or wave action.
            5.   Periodic maintenance is required in lakes to control weed and
larval growth. The facility shall also be designed to provide for the easy
removal of sediment, which will accumulate during periods of reservoir
operation. A means of maintaining the designed water level of the lake during
prolonged periods of dry weather is also required.
            6.   For emergency use, facility cleaning or shoreline maintenance,
additional facilities may have to be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary
equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
            7.   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be
provided, if required by the utility. Design calculations to substantiate the
effectiveness of these aeration facilities shall be submitted with final
engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual operation and maintenance of
aeration facilities shall be prepared to the satisfaction of the Board.
      (11)   Roof top storage. Detention storage requirements may be met in
total or in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of the design to be
included in the building permit application shall include the depth and volume
of storage, details of outlet devices and down drains, elevations of emergency

temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as empty the stored waters slowly. Depths
of storage shall be limited to a maximum of 8 inches in vehicle parking areas
so as to limit damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles
is not impaired. The utility may require implementation of best management
practices and/or construction of best available treatment technologies to
reduce stormwater pollution from parking lots.
      (13)   Underground tanks or pipes. Detention storage requirements may be
met in total or in part by detention in underground tank(s) or in a network of
underground pipes. Tanks must be of reinforced concrete construction unless
otherwise approved by the utility. Pipes must be reinforced concrete or dual
wall (corrugated exterior/smooth interior) high-density polyethylene (HPDE)
materials unless otherwise approved by the utility. Details of the underground
storage system and the outlet or release structure(s) to be included in the
building permit application.
      (14)   Retention basins. Retention basins (no outlet) are considered a
last resort system. The utility may require the construction of a suitable
outlet to prevent the use of retention basins. Retention basins will not be
considered unless infiltration wells, dry wells, or other sub-surface
absorption system are proposed in conjunction with the retention well.
      (15)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of
stormwater control systems and required facilities shall be accepted as part of
the cost of land development.
      (16)   Facility maintenance responsibilities. Maintenance of detention/
retention facilities during construction and thereafter shall be the
responsibility of the land developer/owner. Assignment of responsibility for
maintaining facilities serving more than 1 lot or holding shall be documented
by appropriate covenants to property deeds, unless responsibility is formally
accepted by a public body, and shall be determined before the final drainage
plans are approved.
      (17)   Inspections. All public and privately-owned detention storage
facilities may be inspected by representatives of the utility at the city's
discretion.
      (18)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector,
the owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to take the
necessary measures to correct these deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so,
the city will undertake the work and collect the cost of maintenance or repair
from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
      (19)   Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems
may be planned and constructed jointly by 2 or more developers as long as
compliance with this chapter is maintained.
      (20)   Installation of erosion control systems. Runoff and erosion
control systems in accordance with division (B)(16) above shall be installed.
The city will require an erosion control plan to be submitted as part of the
construction plans and specifications. Detention/retention basins shall be
designed with an additional 6% of available capacity to allow for sediment
accumulation resulting from development and to permit the pond to function for
reasonable periods between cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect
sediment and debris in specific locations so that removal costs are kept to a
minimum.
      (21)   Detention facilities in floodplains; off-site drainage provisions.
When the allowable runoff is released in an area that is susceptible to
flooding, the developer may be required to construct appropriate storm drains
through the area to avert increased flood hazard caused by the concentration of
allowable runoff at 1 point instead of the natural overland distribution. The
requirement of off site drains shall be at the discretion of the utility.
      (22)   As-built plans. Whenever the utility has agreed to consider
accepting facilities constructed by developers, a professionally prepared (by
professional engineer or registered land surveyor) and certified “As Built” set
of prints or plans shall be submitted to the Board for review.

§ 54.22 BILLING PROCEDURE; DELINQUENT PAYMENTS; DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Meters are read, bills are prepared and mailed on a cycle basis and
bills are due and payable on the twenty-first day from the mailing date. To all
bills not paid on or within 2 days after due date thereof, there shall be added
collection charges as follows: 10% on the first $3 of billing; 3% on excess
over $3.
   (B)   If bills are not paid within 14 days after due date thereof, the
service will be disconnected in accordance with division (C) below. A customer
may enroll in the level billing program as follows:
2023 S-11
      (1)   As an alternative to billing for the actual amount of utilities
used each month, residential customers shall be given the option of enrolling
into the level billing program. Those residential
customers so enrolled shall be billed equal monthly installments during an 11-
month billing cycle (level
billing period) commencing with the July billing every year, with the equal
monthly installments (level billing amount) determined by averaging the
previous 12-months’ bills at the same location. The equal monthly installments
(level billing period) may be adjusted at any time at the discretion of the
utility business office.
      (2)   The accounts will be reconciled with the June bill each year by
comparing the actual charges incurred during the level billing period, plus the
June charges, against the actual amount paid during the level billing period.
If there is a balance due, the balance must be paid by the due date on the June
bill. If an overpayment of the account has occurred, the overpayment will be
refunded, thereby starting the next level billing period with a zero balance.
      (3)   Enrollment by electing customers must be completed before June 30
or prior to the billing for water customers’ July statement, whichever is
later. The customer must at all times be current with their utility bill in
order to participate in the level billing program, or their participation will
be terminated. Customers electing this level billing program remain subject to
all other rules and regulations of the Washington Municipal Utilities,
including but not limited to, those regarding late payments, penalties and
disconnection.
      (4)   Participation in the program will continue from year-to-year
without having to re-enroll.
      (5)   Customers may terminate their enrollment in the level billing
program by written notification to the utility business office and giving the
utility business office a reasonable opportunity to act on it. The account will
then be reconciled and any balance due must be paid upon termination.
   (C)   The city shall disconnect utility service in accord with the following
policies:
      (1)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid and any deposit required
has been made. It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, the next
bill will show disconnection date for non-payment of previous bill.
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
   (D)   Upon the customer paying a delinquent bill, the customer must also pay
a “delinquent fee” of $50.
(Prior Code, § 53.22) (Am. Ord. 24-2008, passed 12-22-2008; Am. Ord. 25-2008,

§ 54.23 ACCESSIBILITY TO METERS.
   Water meters must, at all times, be accessible to utility personnel for the
purpose of reading, testing and maintenance.
   (A)   If the city is unable to gain access to an inside or outside meter for
any reason, in order to obtain a reading for 60 days, the city shall send the
customer a letter requesting arrangements for access within regular working
hours or service will be discontinued.
   (B)   In the event shrubbery or other obstructions inhibit access to the
meter, and/or the viewing of the meter dial, the customer will be formally
requested in writing and given 30 days in which to remove (or trim) the
shrubbery or other obstruction so that uninhibited access of the meter can take
place. Should the customer choose not to comply with the request, the city
itself may remove (or trim) the inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction, or
may contract with a professional for the purpose of removing (or trimming) the
inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction. The customer, in this event, shall
be responsible for the reasonable costs of removing and/or trimming the
inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction and will be billed accordingly.
   (C)   In the event the customer requests a utility service be relocated,
either temporarily or permanently, the customer will be charged for time and
material.

WATER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE
§ 54.40 WATER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   Extension at developer’s expense. The Council hereby establishes a
policy to extend water mains and facilities, at a developer’s initial expense,
to undeveloped areas in which the city has authority to serve. An agreement for
each extension shall be approved by the Council and shall set forth subsequent
connector fees established by the Council applicable to such extension, which
shall be charged and collected in accordance with this subchapter and the
agreement authorizing the extension to which a subscriber subsequently
connects.
   (B)   Subsequent connector fees.
      (1)   The Council hereby authorizes the utility to charge subsequent
connector fees, based upon EDUs, as set forth in this subchapter, to developers
that connect to extensions made under this subchapter and the agreement
authorizing the extension to which the developer connects, in addition to other
fees and charges collected by the utility. Subsequent connector fees shall be
set in accordance with the formula set forth below:
         (a)   The total cost of construction and installation of water system
improvements is
$  W .
         (b)   The oversizing cost of the water system improvements paid for by
the city is
$  X .
         (c)   Percentage of costs of construction and installation of the
water system improvements developer allowed to recover  Y% .
         (d)   Total costs for construction and installation of the water
system improvements paid by developer and approved for potential developer
recovery  ($W - $X) x (Y%) = $Z .
         (e)   The total number of EDUs for which the water system improvements
have the capacity to serve is  A .
         (f)   The number of the water system improvement project’s EDUs
attributable to the developer  B .
         (g)   The number of water system improvement project EDUs to be used
in calculating the subsequent connector fee  A - B = C .
         (h)   The cost of the water system improvements per EDU is  $Z / C =
$D , which
$D  is the subsequent connector fee per EDU for the developer’s water system
improvement project.
      (2)   The utility shall adopt policies that uniformly apply to the
collection of the subsequent connector fees. Subsequent connector fees shall
not be reduced or waived without approval by the Council after positive,
negative or no recommendation by the utility. The utility shall also collect a
$10 administrative fee per EDU for processing subsequent connector fees from
initial developers, which may be deducted from subsequent connector fee
reimbursement payments.
   (C)   Subsequent connector fee proceeds. Proceeds from subsequent connector
fees shall be considered payment toward the cost of construction of the mains
and facilities and for reimbursement to the developer.
   (D)   Administrative fee. Any developer choosing to be reimbursed under this
subchapter shall pay to the utility an administrative fee of $10 per EDU. Such
administrative fee shall be withheld by the utility from each annual payment
made to the developer.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND POLICY.
   The Council finds that the discharge of water from roofs, ground, paved
surfaces, sump pumps, footing tiles, swimming pools, and other real estate
improvements into the city's sanitary sewer system has caused and will continue
to cause flooding and overloading of the sanitary sewer system. Flooding and
overloading has caused and will continue to cause damage to the property of
city residents and creates a hazard to the health of city residents. The
Council further finds it essential to the maintenance of health, safety, and
general welfare of its residents that the discharges be prohibited and the
provisions of this section be strictly enforced.

FEES
§ 53.30 STORMWATER USER’S FEE ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   There shall be imposed on each and every property in the city, except
exempt property, a stormwater user's fee, which shall be set from time to time
by ordinance or resolution, and in manner and amount prescribed by this
section.
   (B)   Prior to establishing or amending user's fees, the municipality shall
provide notice pursuant to I.C. 36-9-23-26.
(Ord. 15-2004, passed 9-13-2004; Am. Ord. 21-2018, passed 11-13-2018)
§ 53.31 EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU).
   (A)   Establishment, There is established for purposes of calculating the
stormwater user's fee the equivalent residential unit (ERU).
   (B)   Definition. One ERU is the average square footage of a detached single
family's impervious surface area for residential property set at 2,558 sq. ft.
   (C)   Setting the ERU. The ERU shall be set by the City Council from time to
time by ordinance or resolution. Subject to a future ordinance or resolution
the ERU for Washington, Indiana is hereby set at 2,558 square feet.
   (D)   Source of ERU. The City Council shall have the discretion to determine
the source of the data from which the ERU is established, taking into
consideration the general acceptance and use of the source on the part of other

§ 53.32 PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORMWATER’S USER’S FEE.
   (A)   Property classifications. For purposes of determining the stormwater
user's fee, all properties in the city are classified into 1 of the following
classes:
      (1)   Residential property;
      (2)   Non-residential property; and
      (3)   Exempt property.
   (B)   User fee determination. All owners of real property in the City of
Washington shall be charged a stormwater fee based on §
53.32(C) below.
   (C)   Initial billing.
      (1)   All property classifications except exempt property shall be billed
for 1 equivalent residential unit (ERU). As rapidly as resources allow, the
utility shall make a determination as to the multiple of ERUs to be assigned to
each property classification except exempt property. The determination shall be
made in categories based on customer classifications, in the following order:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   Non-residential; and
         (c)   Exempt.
      (2)   Once the determination of multiples has been substantially
completed for each individual category listed above, each and every property in
that category shall be billed according to their actual number of ERUs.
   (D)   Residential fee. The City Council finds that the intensity of
development of most parcels of real property in the municipality classified as
residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily
expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such
as buildings, structures, and other impervious areas) on each parcel.
Therefore, all single-family residential properties in the city shall be
charged a flat stormwater user fee, equal to the base rate, regardless of the
size of the parcel or the improvements.
   (E)   Non-residential property fee. The fee for non-residential property in
the municipality shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor
obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by
1 ERU or 2,558 sq. ft. The minimum stormwater user fee for non-residential
property shall equal the base rate for residential property. The maximum user
fee for a parcel block owned by the same entity is $108.75. Users will be
billed for each non-contiguous parcel block they own.
   (F)   Exempt property. There shall be no stormwater user's fee for exempt
property.

§ 53.33 BASE RATE.
   The City Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, establish the base rate
for the stormwater user's fee. The base rate shall be calculated to insure
adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater management and to provide for
the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the stormwater system
in the city. Subject to a future ordinance or resolution the City Council sets
the base rate for 1 ERU at $6.15 per month.

§ 53.34 ADJUSTMENTS TO STORMWATER USER’S FEES.
   The stormwater utility shall have the right on its own initiative to adjust
upward or downward the stormwater user's fees with respect to any property.
Non-exempt property ERU calculations are based on Daviess County Assessor's
information and will be checked on an annual basis, and changes will be based
on that information.

   The owner of each non-exempt parcel or parcel block shall pay the stormwater
user's fees and charges as provided in this chapter. Owners of rental property
may provide for the renter to pay the fee; however, the property owner shall be
responsible for failure of the renter to pay the user fee.

§ 53.37 APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.
   (A)   If, in the opinion of any user, the ERU assigned to the user's real
estate parcel is inaccurate, the user shall have the right to contest the ERU
determination and thus the stormwater fee assessed in accordance with the
provisions contained in this section.
   (B)   The user shall obtain and complete a “Petition to Appeal Stormwater
Assessment” form and file same with verifiable documentation supporting user's
claim. Said form shall be filed in the city utility office. The utility will
have 30 days to investigate the users claim and shall render a written decision
that either the original ERU determination and assessment should be affirmed,
or that the user's rate should be adjusted.
   (C)   The determination made by the utility shall be forwarded by mail. The
user shall have 15 days from date of receipt to request reconsideration if
dissatisfied with the decision of the utility. Said request shall be made in
writing and directed to the Board of Public Works and Safety of the City of
Washington.
   (D)   The Washington Board of Public Works and Safety shall conduct a
hearing to determine and resolve the dispute based on the documentation
submitted and oral testimony. The Board shall issue a determination which shall
be binding upon the city and the user. Any user aggrieved by the Final Board
determination shall have the right to judicial review of such determination in
accordance with Indiana law.

temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as empty the stored waters slowly. Depths
of storage shall be limited to a maximum of 8 inches in vehicle parking areas
so as to limit damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles
is not impaired. The utility may require implementation of best management
practices and/or construction of best available treatment technologies to
reduce stormwater pollution from parking lots.
      (13)   Underground tanks or pipes. Detention storage requirements may be
met in total or in part by detention in underground tank(s) or in a network of
underground pipes. Tanks must be of reinforced concrete construction unless
otherwise approved by the utility. Pipes must be reinforced concrete or dual
wall (corrugated exterior/smooth interior) high-density polyethylene (HPDE)
materials unless otherwise approved by the utility. Details of the underground
storage system and the outlet or release structure(s) to be included in the
building permit application.
      (14)   Retention basins. Retention basins (no outlet) are considered a
last resort system. The utility may require the construction of a suitable
outlet to prevent the use of retention basins. Retention basins will not be
considered unless infiltration wells, dry wells, or other sub-surface
absorption system are proposed in conjunction with the retention well.
      (15)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of
stormwater control systems and required facilities shall be accepted as part of
the cost of land development.
      (16)   Facility maintenance responsibilities. Maintenance of detention/
retention facilities during construction and thereafter shall be the
responsibility of the land developer/owner. Assignment of responsibility for
maintaining facilities serving more than 1 lot or holding shall be documented
by appropriate covenants to property deeds, unless responsibility is formally
accepted by a public body, and shall be determined before the final drainage
plans are approved.
      (17)   Inspections. All public and privately-owned detention storage
facilities may be inspected by representatives of the utility at the city's
discretion.
      (18)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector,
the owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to take the
necessary measures to correct these deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so,
the city will undertake the work and collect the cost of maintenance or repair
from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
      (19)   Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems
may be planned and constructed jointly by 2 or more developers as long as
compliance with this chapter is maintained.
      (20)   Installation of erosion control systems. Runoff and erosion
control systems in accordance with division (B)(16) above shall be installed.
The city will require an erosion control plan to be submitted as part of the
construction plans and specifications. Detention/retention basins shall be
designed with an additional 6% of available capacity to allow for sediment
accumulation resulting from development and to permit the pond to function for
reasonable periods between cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect
sediment and debris in specific locations so that removal costs are kept to a
minimum.
      (21)   Detention facilities in floodplains; off-site drainage provisions.
When the allowable runoff is released in an area that is susceptible to
flooding, the developer may be required to construct appropriate storm drains
through the area to avert increased flood hazard caused by the concentration of
allowable runoff at 1 point instead of the natural overland distribution. The
requirement of off site drains shall be at the discretion of the utility.
      (22)   As-built plans. Whenever the utility has agreed to consider
accepting facilities constructed by developers, a professionally prepared (by
professional engineer or registered land surveyor) and certified “As Built” set
of prints or plans shall be submitted to the Board for review.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
      CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement between 2
otherwise separate systems, 1 of which contains potable water from the city
water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or
questionable safety, or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow
from 1 or of the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure
differential between the 2 systems.
   (B)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established, or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No
interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private,
auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply
of the city may enter the supply or distribution system of the municipality,
unless the private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of the supply shall have been approved by the municipal
utilities and by the State Department of Environmental Management in accordance
with 327 I.A.C. § 8-10.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the State Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by
the public water system where cross connections with the public water system is
deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on
potential health hazards involved shall be annually by a qualified tester, with
results being delivered to Washington Waterworks.
   (D)   Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the State
Department of Environmental Management shall have the right to request entry at
any reasonable time to examine any property served by a connection to the
public water system of Washington for cross connections. On request, the owner,
lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection
agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on the
property. The refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information
shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross connections.
   (E)   The city municipal utility is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation
of this statute exists, and to take other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee or occupants of the property or premises where a violation is
found or suspected to exist. Water service to property shall not be restored
until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with the
provisions of this section.
   (F)   If it is deemed by the municipal utilities that a cross connection or
an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk-Treasurer
of the city and delivered to the consumer's premises, service may be
immediately discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for a hearing
within 10 days of the emergency discontinuance.
   (G)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories and all other hazardous

reasonable and just within the meaning of I.C. 8-1.5-3-8 and include each of
the elements of reasonable and just rates and charges for services under I.C.

(Prior Code, § 53.21) (Ord. 9-2001, passed 5-29-2001; Am. Ord. 2-2006, passed
4-10-2006)
§ 54.22 BILLING PROCEDURE; DELINQUENT PAYMENTS; DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Meters are read, bills are prepared and mailed on a cycle basis and
bills are due and payable on the twenty-first day from the mailing date. To all
bills not paid on or within 2 days after due date thereof, there shall be added
collection charges as follows: 10% on the first $3 of billing; 3% on excess
over $3.
   (B)   If bills are not paid within 14 days after due date thereof, the
service will be disconnected in accordance with division (C) below. A customer
may enroll in the level billing program as follows:
      (1)   As an alternative to billing for the actual amount of utilities
used each month, residential customers shall be given the option of enrolling
into the level billing program. Those residential customers so enrolled shall
be billed equal monthly installments during an 11-month billing cycle (level
billing period) commencing with the July billing every year, with the equal
monthly installments (level billing amount) determined by averaging the
previous 12-months’ bills at the same location. The equal monthly installments
(level billing period) may be adjusted at any time at the discretion of the
utility business office.
      (2)   The accounts will be reconciled with the June bill each year by
comparing the actual charges incurred during the level billing period, plus the
June charges, against the actual amount paid during the level billing period.
If there is a balance due, the balance must be paid by the due date on the June
bill. If an overpayment of the account has occurred, the overpayment will be
refunded, thereby starting the next level billing period with a zero balance.
      (3)   Enrollment by electing customers must be completed before June 30
or prior to the billing for water customers’ July statement, whichever is
later. The customer must at all times be current with their utility bill in
order to participate in the level billing program, or their participation will
be terminated. Customers electing this level billing program remain subject to
all other rules and regulations of the Washington Municipal Utilities,
including but not limited to, those regarding late payments, penalties and
disconnection.
      (4)   Participation in the program will continue from year-to-year
without having to re-enroll.
      (5)   Customers may terminate their enrollment in the level billing
program by written notification to the utility business office and giving the
utility business office a reasonable opportunity to act on it. The account will
then be reconciled and any balance due must be paid upon termination.
   (C)   The city shall disconnect utility service in accord with the following
policies:
      (1)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid and any deposit required
has been made. It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, the next
bill will show disconnection date for non-payment of previous bill.
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
   (D)   Upon the customer paying a delinquent bill, the customer must also pay
a “delinquent fee” of $50.
(Prior Code, § 53.22) (Am. Ord. 24-2008, passed 12-22-2008; Am. Ord. 25-2008,
passed 12-22-2008; Am. Ord. 7-2009, passed 4-27-2009; Am. Ord. 26-2021, passed
11-22-2021)
§ 54.23 ACCESSIBILITY TO METERS.
   Water meters must, at all times, be accessible to utility personnel for the
purpose of reading, testing and maintenance.
   (A)   If the city is unable to gain access to an inside or outside meter for
any reason, in order to obtain a reading for 60 days, the city shall send the
customer a letter requesting arrangements for access within regular working
hours or service will be discontinued.
   (B)   In the event shrubbery or other obstructions inhibit access to the
meter, and/or the viewing of the meter dial, the customer will be formally
requested in writing and given 30 days in which to remove (or trim) the
shrubbery or other obstruction so that uninhibited access of the meter can take
place. Should the customer choose not to comply with the request, the city
itself may remove (or trim) the inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction, or
may contract with a professional for the purpose of removing (or trimming) the
inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction. The customer, in this event, shall
be responsible for the reasonable costs of removing and/or trimming the
inhibiting shrubbery or other obstruction and will be billed accordingly.
   (C)   In the event the customer requests a utility service be relocated,
either temporarily or permanently, the customer will be charged for time and
material.

WATER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE
§ 54.40 WATER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.
   (A)   Extension at developer’s expense. The Council hereby establishes a
policy to extend water mains and facilities, at a developer’s initial expense,
to undeveloped areas in which the city has authority to serve. An agreement for
each extension shall be approved by the Council and shall set forth subsequent
connector fees established by the Council applicable to such extension, which
shall be charged and collected in accordance with this subchapter and the
agreement authorizing the extension to which a subscriber subsequently
connects.
   (B)   Subsequent connector fees.
      (1)   The Council hereby authorizes the utility to charge subsequent
connector fees, based upon EDUs, as set forth in this subchapter, to developers
that connect to extensions made under this subchapter and the agreement
authorizing the extension to which the developer connects, in addition to other
fees and charges collected by the utility. Subsequent connector fees shall be
set in accordance with the formula set forth below:
         (a)   The total cost of construction and installation of water system
improvements is $  W .
         (b)   The oversizing cost of the water system improvements paid for by
the city is $  X .
         (c)   Percentage of costs of construction and installation of the
water system improvements developer allowed to recover  Y% .
         (d)   Total costs for construction and installation of the water
system improvements paid by developer and approved for potential developer
recovery  ($W - $X) x (Y%) = $Z .
         (e)   The total number of EDUs for which the water system improvements
have the capacity to serve is  A .
         (f)   The number of the water system improvement project’s EDUs
attributable to the developer  B .
         (g)   The number of water system improvement project EDUs to be used
in calculating the subsequent connector fee  A - B = C .
         (h)   The cost of the water system improvements per EDU is  $Z / C =
$D , which  $D  is the subsequent connector fee per EDU for the developer’s
water system improvement project.
      (2)   The utility shall adopt policies that uniformly apply to the
collection of the subsequent connector fees. Subsequent connector fees shall
not be reduced or waived without approval by the Council after positive,
negative or no recommendation by the utility. The utility shall also collect a
$10 administrative fee per EDU for processing subsequent connector fees from
initial developers, which may be deducted from subsequent connector fee
reimbursement payments.
   (C)   Subsequent connector fee proceeds. Proceeds from subsequent connector
fees shall be considered payment toward the cost of construction of the mains
and facilities and for reimbursement to the developer.
   (D)   Administrative fee. Any developer choosing to be reimbursed under this
subchapter shall pay to the utility an administrative fee of $10 per EDU. Such
administrative fee shall be withheld by the utility from each annual payment
made to the developer.

standing or parking of motor vehicles in spaces reserved for persons with
physical disabilities so long as the ordinance does not conflict with state

disability, an unexpired disabled veteran's registration plate, or an unexpired
registration plate or decal for a person with a physical disability issued
under the laws of another state to stand or park in a space reserved for a
person with a physical disability but only when the vehicle is being used to
transport a person with a physical disability.
      (4)   It shall be a violation for any person to park a motor vehicle
which does not display a placard of a person with a physical disability or a
disabled veteran issued under I.C. 9-14-5 or under the laws of another state or
a registration plate of a person with a physical disability or a disabled

parking space reserved for a person with a physical disability, a placard or

I.C. 9-18-22, or under the laws of another state.
      (7)   It shall be a violation for a person who, in a parking space
reserved for a person with a physical disability, parks a vehicle that displays
a placard or special registration plate entitling a person to park in a parking
space reserved for a person with a physical disability if that person is not,
at that time, in the process of transporting a person with a physical
disability or disabled veteran.
      (8)   It shall be a violation for an owner or lessee of a motor vehicle
to park a motor vehicle in a parking space in a parking facility reserved for
the use of persons with physical disabilities if that motor vehicle does not
display an unexpired parking permit for a person with a physical disability
issued under I.C. 9-14-5; an unexpired disabled veteran's registration plate
under I.C. 9-18-18; an unexpired registration plate or decal for a person with
a physical disability under I.C. 9-18-22; or an unexpired parking permit for a
person with a physical disability, an unexpired disabled veteran's registration
plate, or an unexpired registration plate or a decal fro a person with a
physical disability issued under the laws of another state.
      (9)   It is a defense that I.C. 9-30-11-8 applies to the violation.
      (10)   It is a defense that the motor vehicle was the subject of an
offense described in I.C. 35-43-4 at the time of the violation.
      (11)   The City Police Department shall be empowered to enforce this
section and to issue citations to individuals believed to have violated the
section.

shall be made payable to the City of Washington.

animal is kept or maintained.
   LIVESTOCK. Cattle, horses, swine, sheep, goats, poultry and other animals

vaccinated for rabies within the last 12-month period. If unable to do so, the
animal will not be released until the owner visits the veterinarian of their

owner may then take the animal back to the veterinarian for its shot.
(Ord. 14-99, passed 10-11-1999)

of the city, the above charges shall apply for the time the animal is in the
animal control officer’s custody, and an additional fee of $20 for transporting
the animal shall apply. The charges and fees are in addition to any penalties
or costs assessed under §
91.15(B), (C) or (D). Any pound into whose custody an animal is delivered may
not release the animal to its owner or keeper without the written authorization
of the animal control officer showing that the above charges owing the city
have been paid, but in addition, may charge and collect its own usual and
standard pound fees from the person reclaiming the animal for the period of
time the animal was in custody of the pound as a further condition of the
animal’s release. An animal which was impounded by reason of a suspected

intensity or sound pressure level. The difference in DECIBELS between a
measured sound pressure level and a reference sound pressure level is 20 times
the logarithm of their ratio. For purposes of this chapter, the term DECIBEL
shall be consistent with its definition and use by the American National
Standards Institute.

substantially similar violation.
   PUBLIC SPACE. Any real property or structures thereon that are owned,
leased, or controlled by a governmental entity.
   SOUND LEVEL METER. An instrument that includes devices and electronics to
measure sound pressure levels. The output is expressed as a single reading
using either the A-weighting and or C-weighting filters. The device shall be
annually calibrated by the manufacturer.
   SOUND PRODUCTION DEVICE. Any device whose primary function is the production
of sound, including, but not limited to, any musical instrument, loudspeaker,
radio, television, digital or analog music player, public address system or
sound-amplifying equipment.

   (B)   (1)   Inspection; order upon determination of violation. When a
complaint alleging a violation of this chapter is received by the Department

         (c)   The time period for correcting the violation;

warrant (I.C. 36-7-9-16) or other court order, from a court of law to enter
onto any occupied property and make an inspection if the owner or person in
control of the property does not voluntarily give permission to enter the
property to make the inspection. The search shall be limited to the places
pertinent to the complaint or as outlined in the inspection warrant. No such

part of a subdivision, the required right-of-way width for the street shall be
as specified in the Thoroughfare Plan, provided that where a street borders a
tract of land to be subdivided, the owner of the land shall be required to plat

§ 153.16 LOCATION OF STREETS.
   (A)   Wherever the location of a street is indicated in the Thoroughfare
Plan as following an existing road or street, or a section or half-section or
other established property line, the location of the street shall conform to
the location; however, a street lying wholly within a subdivision, and not
designated as following an existing road or established property line, may be
varied in its alignment when the variance promotes the plan of a neighborhood
development unit in accordance with good site planning principles, and if the
alignment provides for the continuity of traffic movement.
   (B)   Wherever the location of a street is indicated in the Thoroughfare
Plan as following an irregular alignment, or a revised alignment, or is not
referenced to an established line, it shall follow the alignment shown in the
Thoroughfare Plan. The alignment shall be subject to a detailed survey which
may be made by the Commission or other public agencies, or by the owners of
land to be subdivided if required by the Commission. The survey for the street

area or section to the city, but which improvement, installation or otherwise
platted entity having not been installed, improved, constructed or otherwise
acted upon within a period of 7 years may be unplatted by request of any
individual, and the Common Council shall have 2 public hearings thereon, and if
deemed in the public interest that any roadway, alleyway, easement or other
platted entity in which the city may have a reservation of any interest such as
a utility easement, roadway or thoroughfare right-of-way easement or other
interest, and upon approval of the Council, the city may direct the City
Attorney to return to the record landowner upon whose real estate the platted
but nonexistent entity is located, by quit-claim deed, any right, title and
interest the city may have in the platted, but nonexistent entity.

these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal,
it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial
justices may be done and the public interest secured, provided that the

those regulations; and further provided the Commission shall not approve
variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injuries to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which variance is sought and are not applicable to
other or all property within or outside of a particular subdivision;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and/or

and there are indications that the lots will eventually be resubdivided into
smaller building sites, the Commission may require that the parcel of land
allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of streets
may be made a requirement of the plat.
(Prior Code, § 155.16)
§ 154.027 PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION.
   (A)   In order to make the most of the opportunities related to the
subdivision and to conserve time, effort and expense, the owner or subdivider
should consult with the Commission and public officials prior to the
preparation of the preliminary plan of the subdivision.
   (B)   The master plan should be reviewed to determine how the proposed plan
will fit into the master plan, requirements of the thoroughfare plan, school
and recreational sites, shopping centers, community facilities, sanitation,
water supply and drainage and relationship to other developments existing and
proposed in the vicinity should be determined in advance of the preparation of
the subdivision plan. Consultation should also be held with those familiar with
the economic factors affecting the subdivision. A thorough estimate of the
situation will result in sound decisions with respect to the form, character
and extent of the proposed subdivision.
   (C)   No land shall be subdivided for residential use, unless adequate
access to the land over improved streets or thoroughfares exists or will be
provided by the subdivides or if the land is considered by the Commission to be
unsuitable for use by reason of flooding or improper drainage, objectionable
earth and rock formation, topography or any other feature harmful to the health
and safety of possible residents and the community as a whole.
   (D)   For purposes of these regulations, a subdivision shall be considered
to have adequate access for public health and safety purposes only if it meets
either of the following standards:
      (1)   If the proposed subdivision plat shows no more than 25 lots, every
proposed lot in the subdivision will be situated within 800 feet of the nearest
point of access to an arterial street, feeder street or thoroughfare as
designated on the thoroughfare plan; or
      (2)   The proposed subdivision will have at least two points of access to
arterial streets, feeder streets or thoroughfares as designated on the
thoroughfare plan.
   (E)   If a resubdivision proposal under §
154.026 will result in a subdivision plat that shows more than 25 lots, then
the subdivision must meet the standard prescribed by division (D)(2) above.
   (F)   The City Plan Commission may issue a waiver of the requirements of
paragraph (D) and (E) upon a showing of special circumstances which would tend
to mitigate the public health and safety concerns which are the basis for these
requirements.

(Prior Code, § 155.42)
§ 154.067 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   Recommendations and calculations.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any sub-
division plat which does not make adequate provision for storm water runoff
channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall
be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as approved by the Plan
Commission, and a copy of the design computations shall be submitted along with
the plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across
or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the
gutter or when the encroachment of storm water into the street disrupts
traffic.
      (2)   When calculations indicated that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point and catch
basins or inlets shall be used to intercept flow at the point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The subdivider may be required by the Plan Commission to
carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist,
either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. The drainage
facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual, unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewer.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the subdivider shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance adequate provision shall be made for disposal of storm water. However,
in subdivisions containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area, and in
commercial and industrial districts, underground storm sewers systems shall be
constructed throughout the subdivision and be conducted to an approved outfall.
Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the Street Commissioner.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the Street Commissioner, the subdivider shall make
arrangements for future storm water disposal by the public utility system at
the time the plat receives final approval.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The subdivider's engineer shall determine the necessary size of
the facility, based on the provisions of the required construction standards
and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development is permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Effects on downstream drainage areas. The subdivider's engineer
shall determine the effect of the proposed subdivision on existing drainage
facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, storage basin retention facilities
must be constructed by the subdivider to control the appropriate runoff rate.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage course, drainage-
way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall
be provided, granted or dedicated to the city or county conforming
substantially to the lines of the watercourse, and of the width and
construction as will be adequate for the purpose of both drainage and
maintenance of right-of-way. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate
width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street right-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for the drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
(Prior Code, § 155.43)
§ 154.068 SANITARY SEWERS.

the sewage into an established municipal or other public agency sanitary sewage
disposal and treatment system, at a point and in a manner approved in writing
by the municipal or other public agency involved. The plans for the complete
installation of the sewage system showing all locations, material, size,
profiles and any connections thereto shall be prepared by a Registered Engineer
and/or Registered Land Surveyor at the expense of the subdivider or developer
and shall be approved by and meet the requirements of the affected municipal or
other public agency and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
      (2)   Private or quasi-public system.
         (a)   A complete sanitary sewage system to convey the sewage to a
treatment plant provided by the developer or others and prepared by a
Registered Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor in accordance with the
requirements of the County Board of Health and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management.
         (b)   A complete sanitary sewer system which shall connect into the
sanitary sewage disposal system of a sewage disposal company which shall hold,
at the time of plat submission, a certificate of territorial authority issued
by the Public Service Commission of Indiana authorizing sewage disposal service
for the area in which the subdivision is located. The plans for the complete
installation of the sewer system both within the subdivision and any off-site
installations serving the subdivision showing all locations, size, material,
profiles, and capacities, shall be prepared by a Registered Engineer and/or a
Registered Land Surveyor submitted to and approved by the County Board of
Health and/or the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
         (c)   If the developer submits proper evidence to the County Health
Department that neither of the above forms of sewage disposal and treatment is
possible or economically feasible, then the developer or lot owner shall be
permitted to use a private sanitary sewage disposal system (septic system) on
each individual lot when installed in accordance with the design standards and
approval of the Daviess County Board of Health or Indiana State Department of
Health.
         (d)   Additional requirements for all septic systems must (no
exceptions) include a perimeter subsurface perforated pipe drainage system with
adequate drainage outlet into swale, ditch, ravine, creek, etc. Off-site
drainage easements will be required where no on-site outlets are available. All
easements must be recorded with the County Recorder Following approval and
prior to construction of drainage improvements.
         (e)   Install septic system at least 25 feet from any property line.

(Am. Ord. 8-86, passed 7-14-1986)
      (1)   FP-Floodplain District.
         (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to regulate development
in flood prone areas. The new construction of buildings and other new
development or land uses in the flood hazard areas of Washington, if not
properly regulated to account for the potential hazard, could result in the
loss of life and property, create health and safety hazards, and lead to
extraordinary expenditures for flood protection and relief. Development of
these areas is not essential to the orderly growth of the community. These
lands are suitable for open space and other uses that do not require structures
or fill. The identification of the floodplain, which includes the floodway and
flood fringe, has been made by the Federal Flood Insurance Administration of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Indiana Department of Natural
Resources shall exercise primary jurisdiction in the floodway under the
provisions of I.C. 36-9; however, the Plan Commission or Board of Zoning
Appeals may impose terms and conditions on any permits they issue which are
more restrictive than those imposed by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (b)   Permitted uses (See Table 1). The uses shown in Table 1 shall be
permitted provided they do not require the extensive use of structures or
storage of materials or equipment; however, in no event shall the use of fill
from either within or without the floodplain district be allowed without the
specific permission from and authority of the Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are specifically prohibited
in the floodplain, except where allowed by special exception:
            1.   The storage or disposal of any soil, loam, peat, sand, gravel,
rock or other mineral substance, refuse, trash, rubbish, debris or dredged
soil, except by special exception;
            2.   The drainage, excavation or dredging, or removal or relocation
of loam, peat, sand, gravel, soil, rock or other mineral substance, except as
necessary to work, or permitted as of right or by special exception;
            3.   The storage or disposal of materials used for snow and ice
control including sand, salt and other deicing chemicals;
            4.   The manufacture, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes;
            5.   Solid waste landfills, junk yards, salvage yards and dumps;
and
            6.   Septic tanks and fields.
         (d)   Non-conforming uses. Any building, structure or use of land in
the floodplain district which is not in conformance with this chapter
constitutes a non-conforming use. All applications to repair, extend or enlarge
a non-conforming use shall be forwarded to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and shall be incorporated into the issuance of any local permit.
         (e)   Issuance of improvement location permit.
            1.   The Plan Commission shall keep and maintain all records,
including all first floor elevations, certificates, plans, and other materials
associated with any permit or variance issued within the floodplain.
            2.   The Plan Commission shall not issue an improvement location
permit within the floodplain until the applicant submits evidence that:
               a.   A proper permit or letter or recommendation for it has been
granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources;
               b.   All buildings or additions to existing buildings shall have
flood protection grades at least 2 feet above the regulatory flood;
               c.   No use shall increase the base flood level of a regulatory
flood; and
               d.   A commercial or industrial well will not adversely effect
any municipal water supply source.
            3.   The Plan Commission shall not issue an improvement location
permit for a mobile home in a floodplain.
            4.   All applications for improvement location permits involving
new construction or substantial improvement to existing buildings shall be
accompanied by an elevation certificate which needs to be completed by the
applicant and have the lowest floor elevation certified by a licensed
professional engineer or land surveyor. The elevation certificate should be
presented to the Plan Director at the time the owner is applying for a
certificate of occupancy.
         (f)   General disclaimer in areas of potential flooding. In the
floodplain, floodway and flood fringe areas defined in this chapter, the degree
of flood protection established is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific considerations. Larger
floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
constructed or natural causes such as ice or debris jams. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside flood hazard areas as defined in this chapter shall be
free of flooding or flood damage. This chapter does not create any liability on
the part of the city, the Plan Commission, Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the state, or any elected or appointed official or employee of them
for any flood damages that result from any reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made under it.
         (g)   Mapping disputes. In a case where a property owner disputes the
boundaries of a zoning district, flood protection grade data or regulatory
flood profile data, the owner shall file a written protest with the Plan
Director. The written protest shall document the disputed area, and be prepared
and attested to by a registered professional engineer. The protest then will be
submitted by the Plan Director to the Plan Commission. The item of dispute will
be brought to the attention of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and
in no case will data be revised without the written approval of the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
         (h)   Basis for establishing a floodplain district. The Floodplain

procedures outlined in
Chapter 155.
         (b)    Permitted uses (See Table 1).
         (c)   Development standards (See Table 2).
            1.   Industrial use standards.
               a.   Heavy industrial use includes manufacturing, processing,
assembling, storing, testing and similar industrial uses which are generally
major operations and extensive in character; require large sites, open storage
and service areas, extensive services and facilities, ready access to regional
transportation; and normally generate some nuisances such as smoke, noise,
vibration, dust, glare, air pollution and water pollution, but not beyond the
district boundary. Waste is limited to wastes other than those classified as
hazardous or toxic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
               b.   Light industrial use includes manufacturing or other
industrial uses which are usually controlled operations; relatively clean,
quiet and free of objectionable or hazardous elements such as smoke, noise,
odor or dust; operating and storing within enclosed structures; and generating
little industrial traffic and no nuisances. Waste disposal is limited to wastes
other than those classified as hazardous or toxic by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.
                  1.   Smoke. No smoke is emitted of a density greater than No.
1 according to the Ringlemann's Scale, except that smoke of a density not in
excess of No. 2 of Ringlemann's Scale shall be permitted for a period not in
excess of 6 minutes in any hour.
                  2.   Fly Ash. No particles from any flue or smokestack shall
exceed 0.2 grains per cubic foot of flue gas at a stack temperature of 500°F.
                  3.   Dust. No dust of any kind produced by the industrial
operations shall be permitted to escape beyond the confines of the building in
which it is produced.
                  4.   Odor. No noxious odor of any kind shall be permitted to
extend beyond the lot lines.
                  5.   Gases and fumes. No gases or fumes toxic to persons or
injurious to property shall be permitted to escape beyond the building in which
they occur.
                  6.   Glare. No glare shall be seen form any street or any
residential area.
                  7.   Vibration. No intense earth shaking vibration shall be
created or maintained by any industry beyond the boundary lines of the tract on
which it is located.
                  8.   Noise and sound. A maximum of 70 decibels at the
property line is permitted. Noise is required to be muffled so as not to become
objectionable due to intermittence, beat frequency or shrillness. Sound may
equal, but not exceed street traffic noise in the vicinity during a normal day
shift work period.
            2.   Industrial parks require conditional use approval and may
include all permitted light industrial uses:
               a.   The tract of land involved shall be of an area of not less
than 20 acres.
               b.   The owner or owners of the tract of land shall have:
                  i.   Prepared a plat for a subdivision of the entire tract;
                  ii.   Prepared a development plan for the entire tract; and
                  iii.   Obtained Commission approval of both the plat for the
subdivision and the development plan according to the requirements of the
subdivision control regulation in Chapter 154 and this zoning code.
               c.   There shall be 1 principal entrance to the industrial park
from any major thoroughfare (frontal highway) bordering the tract, which shall
be designed so that traffic at its intersection with the frontal highway may be
controlled and so that there will be adequate storage space for traffic
destined to enter the frontal highway or to leave the industrial park.
               d.   There shall be no direct entrance or exits from parking
areas or structures into the frontal highway (or highways), but a service drive
parallel to the main trafficway may be provided for access. Traffic on the
service drive shall enter the main trafficway via the principal entry.
               e.   Wherever the industrial park and adjacent residential
districts have a common or joint boundary, an area with a width of at least 25
feet shall be provided for the full length of the boundary for a planting
screen, planted with shrubs and trees so as to provide a tight screen effective
at all seasons of the year.
               f.   The owner or owners shall provide a plan for the
installation of adequate facilities for the disposal of human and industrial
wastes meeting the approval of the State Department of Health.
               g.   The owner or owners shall establish in the restrictions
which are a part of the plat for the subdivision a perpetuating organization
for the maintenance of the industrial park property, such as roads and planting
areas, the approval of building plans and other improvements and the future
maintenance of the park.
               h.   The development plan shall indicate the arrangement of the
interior roads to provide a unified, self-contained arrangement of industrial
sites. The basic concept of the interior road plan shall be subject to the
approval of the Commission and any modification or alterations in the basic
plan shall likewise be subject to approval.
               i.   The development plan shall show building lines established
so that no building or structure shall be erected on any tract within the park
nearer to the center of any interior road than 85 feet, nor nearer than 100
feet to the property line of any bordering highway, and no building shall be
erected closer to the side line of a tract than 35 feet, and not closer to an
adjoining residential district than 75 feet.
               j.   No loading docks may be erected or used fronting on a
bordering highway. Provisions for loading or unloading operations and any
handling of freight or materials outside of buildings shall be located so as
not to face on bordering highways.
               k.   No part of a parking area for passenger vehicles shall be
closer than 25 feet, and no part of a loading or unloading area or parking area
for trucks shall be closer than 200 feet to an adjoining residential district.
All parking, loading and unloading areas shall be paved with a suitable dust-
preventative surface.
               l.   The areas in front and on the sides of buildings shall be
developed in accordance with a well designed plan, and the areas shall be
perpetually maintained to the satisfaction of the park organization.

§ 155.040 CONDITIONAL USES; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Uses permitted. The conditional uses listed in Table 1, Official
Schedule of uses and their accessory buildings and uses may be permitted by the
Board in the districts indicated in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this section. All permitted conditional uses shall meet the development
standards in the zoning district that it is located (See Table 2), and the
general development standards of this chapter.
   (B)   Procedure. Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board may, after public notice and hearing
according to law, grant the application, including the imposition of conditions
of use, which the Board deems essential to insure that the conditional use is
consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter and will not
substantially injure the appropriate use of the neighboring property and will
substantially serve the public convenience and welfare.
(Ord. 7-2000, passed 5-8-2000)
   (C)   Permit required. A home occupation requires a conditional use permit
as listed in Table 1 and as defined in Section § 155.007.
(Prior Code, § 156.17)
§ 155.041 NONCONFORMING USE SPECIFICATIONS.
   The lawful use of a building or premises, existing at the time of passage of
this chapter [July 14, 1986], may be continued although the use does not
conform to all the provisions of this chapter, except as hereinafter provided:
   (A)   A nonconforming use may be extended or continued throughout a building
or premises. Structural alterations, extensions or additions may be made, but
only after obtaining a permit from the Building Commissioner, who may grant it,
provided the proposed change does not exceed 25% of the value of the existing
structure, and the proposed change is not objectionable to the spirit of the
zoning code. He or she shall refuse the permits if a proposed structural
addition, extension or alteration to an existing nonconforming legal use
exceeds 25% of the value of the structure, or if under 25% and no permit is
granted by the Building Commissioner, then an application for a variance must
be made with the Board, which may be granted by the Board if special reason is
found to justify the variance and granting it would not materially harm any
other person or property.
   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or greater restrictions, provided no structural changes are made in the
building, unless conforming with division (A) above. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to conforming use or a use permitted in a district of
greater restrictions, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use
of less restricted one.
   (C)   No building shall be erected upon any premise devoted to a
nonconforming use, except in conformance with regulations of this chapter.
   (D)   The Board may authorize, by written permit, in a residentially-zoned
district for a period of not more than 1 year from the date of the permit, a
temporary building for commercial or industrial use incidental to the
residential construction and development of the district.
   (E)   Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been heretofore issued, and the construction of which has been diligently
prosecuted within 90 days of the date of the permit, and which entire building
shall be completed according to the plans filed within 3 years from the date of
passage of this chapter [July 14, 1986].
   (F)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or premises is
discontinued for a period of 1 year, the use of the same shall thereafter
conform to the use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (G)   Any nonconforming open use of land shall be discontinued within 5
years from the date of passage of this chapter [July 14, 1986].
   (H)   These provisions apply in the same manner to a use which may become a
nonconforming use due to a later amendment to this chapter.

§ 155.046 APPEAL PROCEDURE FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING PERMIT.
   In the event the Building Commissioner fails or refuses to issue the
necessary permit(s), or in the event not all of the landowners adjacent to the
property where the manufacturing unit is to be situated agree to the placement
thereof, thereby prohibiting the Building Commissioner from issuing the permit
(s), then the individual may appeal the prohibition/disapproval to the Common
Council of the city, which shall conduct a hearing thereon at its regularly
held Council meeting on at least 2 separate occasions, and it is specifically
within the right and province of the Council to overrule the provisions of this
chapter, should it deem to be so in the best interests of the parties involved
or to the benefit of the welfare of the citizens of the city. In the event the
Common Council should permit the placement of a manufactured housing unit, it
shall so direct the Building Commissioner to issue the necessary permits and
its decision to become a permanent record of the Building Commissioner of the
city. The placement of Type I manufactured home on any lot on which any other
type of dwelling unit may be placed shall be allowed without the owner having
to follow the signature or appeals procedure which will still be applicable to
Type II and Type III manufactured homes.

      (1)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to
establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings,
signs, street hardware and other improvements that are visible to the public
and affect the physical development of land within the U.S. 50 Bypass Corridor
Overlay Zone.
      (2)   Statement of intent. These standards are intended to promote high
quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and
variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These
standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to
promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent, and
coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the U.S. 50 Bypass
Corridor Zone.
      (3)   Authority. Authority underlying creation of the U.S. Bypass
Corridor Overlay Zone District is provided for in I.C. 36-7-4-201 et. seq. and

   (B)   Statement of significance.
      (1)   U.S. 50 Bypass is a limited access highway crossing south of
Washington on an east/west axis within the 2 mile extraterritorial zoning
jurisdiction. The corridor is expected to experience increasing pressure for
commercial development in the future. Future development of this highly visible
corridor will dramatically change the image of the City of Washington.
      (2)   The visibility and accessibility of the land within the corridor is
unique and therefore commands the highest standards of development which
stimulate substantial capital investments, encourage efficient land use,
promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish
development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this
corridor.

      (1)   If any portion of this U.S. 50 Bypass Overlay Zone is found to be
in conflict with any other provisions of any zoning, building, fire, safety or
health ordinance of the City of Washington, the provision which establishes the
higher standard shall prevail.
      (2)   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phase of the U.S.
50 Bypass Overlay Zone or its application to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by the decision of any court or competent jurisdiction, the remainder

logos shall conform to the criteria of all other signs.
      (11)   Exceptions to these requirements will be made on a case by case
basis by the Washington Plan Commission or its duly appointed or designated
representative.
   (J)   Landscaping plan.
      (1)   Landscaping plan submitted to Plan Commission. A landscaping plan
shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for its approval at the same time
other plans (i.e. architectural design, lighting, parking, signage and site
plans) are submitted. This plan shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions
and distances, shall delineate all existing and proposed structures, private
parking areas,
walks, ramps for handicapped, terraces, driveways, signs, lighting standards,
steps and other driveways, signs, lighting standards, steps and other similar
structures; and shall delineate the location, size and description of all
landscape materials. Landscape treatment for plazas, roads, paths, service and
private parking areas shall be designed as an integral and coordinated part of
the landscape plan for the entire lot.
      (2)   Areas to be landscaped.
         (a)   Greenbelt. The greenbelt shall be suitable landscaped and shall
be otherwise unoccupied except for steps, walks, terraces, driveways, lighting
standards and other similar structures, but excluding private parking areas.
Mounding and other innovative treatments are to be especially encouraged in
this area.
         (b)   Planting adjacent to free-standing buildings.
            1.   A planting area measuring 5 feet in depth shall be installed
adjacent to the front of the building. A planting area 5 feet in depth shall be
installed adjacent to all other sides of the building.
            2.   Sidewalks may be permitted in these areas, but shall not
occupy the entire area on any side as long as the required amount of space is
landscaped, and innovative and original designs are encouraged. The adjacent
planting area at the rear of a structure may be excluded if that structure is
located less that 40 feet from the rear property line and sufficient peripheral
planting is included to compensate for its removal.
         (c)   Peripheral planting.
            1.   There shall be peripheral landscaping strip, 10 feet in depth,
located along the side of any private parking area which abuts any side or rear
property line separating the parcel from any residentially zoned or used
district.

any peripheral landscaping strip.
         (d)   Planting within parking lots.
            1.   All parking lot landscaping shall be of a quality to improve
and enhance the site and its surrounding area.
            2.   Effective use of mounding and existing topography is
encouraged. Landscaping and planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed
throughout the parking area, and not less that 5% of a private parking lot
shall be landscaped.
            3.   For purposes of this computation, landscaping in:
               a.   The greenbelt;
               b.   Adjacent to buildings; and
               c.   On the periphery of the lot shall not be included.
            4.   Landscaping shall be specifically provided at the ends of
parking rows and as a means of separating parking from major circulation isles
within lots.
      (3)   Landscaping standards.
         (a)   The interior dimensions, specifications and design of any
planting area or planting medium proposed to be constructed shall be sufficient
to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to provide for proper
growth.
         (b)   The primary landscaping materials used in the greenbelt and
adjacent to buildings shall consist of one or a combination of the following:
shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, ground covers, grass, mulches, etc.
         (c)   The primary landscaping materials used in and around private
parking areas shall be trees which provide shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges
and other planting material may be used to compliment tree landscaping, but
shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping.
         (d)   All shade trees proposed to be used in accordance with any
landscaping plan shall be a minimum of 8 feet in overall height and have a
minimum trunk diameter, 12 inches above the ground of 2 inches upon planting.
They should be of a variety which will attain an average mature spread greater
than 20 feet.
         (e)   Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local
growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate existing trees should be
conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan. Plant material shall be
selected for interest in its structure, texture and color and for its ultimate
growth. Indigenous and other hardy plants that are harmonious to the design,
and of good appearance shall be used.
         (f)   The landscaping plan shall ensure that sign distances are not
obstructed for drivers of motor vehicles.
         (g)   Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to
beauty and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and developed.

appearance.
         (h)   Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and, if seating is
provided, for sitting.
         (i)   Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthening vistas and important axis, and provide shade.
Spectacular effects shall be reserved for special locations only.
         (j)   Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant
varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent developments.
         (k)   In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by
pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards or other devices.
         (l)   Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees in
parkways or paved areas is encouraged.
         (m)   Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be
unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing, planting or
combinations of these. Screening shall be equally effective in winter and
summer.
         (n)   In areas where general planting will not prosper, other
materials such as fences, walls and pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and
cobbles shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with these
materials where possible.
         (o)   Miscellaneous structures and street hardware shall be designed
to be part of the architectural concept of design and landscape. Materials
shall be compatible with buildings, scale shall be good, colors shall be in
harmony with buildings and surroundings and proportions shall be attractive.
         (p)   Lighting in connection with miscellaneous structures and street
hardware shall meet the criteria applicable to site, landscape, buildings and
signs.
      (4)   Landscaping installation and maintenance.
         (a)   Installation. All landscaping required by the approved
landscaping plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy if the permit is issued during a planting season, or within 6 months
of the date of a certificate of occupancy if issued during a non-planting
season.
         (b)   Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and
their agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance
with the standards set by this chapter and as indicated on the landscaping plan
which has been approved by the Plan Commission. This is to include, but is not
limited to, replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable
substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
         (c)   Changes after approval. No landscaping which has been approved
by the Plan Commission may later be altered, eliminated or sacrificed, without
first obtaining further Plan Commission approval.
         (d)   Inspection. The Plan Commission, Building Commissioner or their
duly appointed representative, shall have the authority to visit any lot within
the U.S. 50 Bypass Overlay Zone to inspect the landscaping and check it against
the approved plan on file.
   (K)   Parking requirements.
      (1)   Parking is to be discouraged between the greenbelt and the building
(s) when other suitable areas for parking exist on the property; however,
private parking may be permitted in the area between the greenbelt and the
planting adjacent to the building(s) and the planting on the periphery of the
property.
      (2)   Efforts to break up large expanses of pavement are to be encouraged
if possible.
      (3)   The number of parking spaces required are as established in City of
Washington Zoning Ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land
use.
      (4)   Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted
to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do
not coincide in time and thereby may be granted to developments which have a
mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and
thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared
justification for seeking exceptions (i.e., a reference such as shared parking,
Urban Land Institute).
      (5)   There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible
to the building(s) and identified as reserved for use by disabled individuals,
and these spaces shall be of sufficient width (minimum of 12 feet) to
accommodate their needs.
   (L)   Lighting requirements. In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot
proposed to be developed, factors to be considered by the Commission shall
include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Safety provided by the lighting;
      (2)   Security provided by the lighting;
      (3)   Possible light spillage or place onto adjoining properties or
streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining
properties is prohibited.);
      (4)   Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility
with the overall treatment of the property;
      (5)   Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use; and
      (6)   Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design and
the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a
design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall
be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided.
   (M)   Access to individual sites.
      (1)   U.S. 50 Bypass. The U.S. 50 Bypass, by its functional nature, is a
limited access highway. Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient
traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional
integrity of the corridor's primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage
roads, access roads, and distributor roads, will have to be built. The roads
shall be coordinated with those of contiguous lots and designed to preserve the
aesthetic benefits provided by the greenlet areas. Access at the side or rear
of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in
the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever
possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the U.S. 50
Bypass Corridor.
      (2)   Curb cuts.
         (a)   No closer than 1 for each 400 feet of frontage.
         (b)   No curb cuts within 200 feet of any intersection of public
roads.
         (c)   Opposing curb cuts shall align squarely or be offset no less
that 200 feet.
   (N)   Access to potential development sites. Stub streets shall be built in
all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development.
Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for
commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by
the Washington Plan Commission or its duly appointed or designated
representative.
   (O)   Other standards.
      (1)   Outside storage prohibited. No outside, unenclosed storage of
refuse (whether or not in containers) or outdoor display of merchandise shall
be permitted on any lot. All refuse shall be contained completely within the
principle or accessory building(s). Exceptions to this requirement will be made
on a case by case basis by the Plan Commission or its duly appointed or
designate representative.
      (2)   Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirement shall be as
specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or
unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by
landscaping or other screening.
      (3)   Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses
which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted,
except that the detached accessory building on any lot shall be architecturally
compatible with the principal building(s) with which it is associated. All
accessory buildings shall have a roof.
      (4)   Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a
hard surface such as asphalt or concrete.
(Prior Code, § 156.28)
§ 155.052 YARD SALES.

      (3)   This Downtown Development Zoning District is hereby declared to be
a district subject to "development requirements" meaning that any development
of real property within this zoning district will require a development plan as
provided for in I.C. 36-7-4-1400 et seq., as it is now, and as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (B)   Development defined. The terms DEVELOP, DEVELOPMENT and DEVELOPING,
when used in this section shall mean, and shall include, the erecting,
constructing, enlarging, altering, repairing, moving, improving, removing,
rehabilitating, revitalization, painting or repainting or demolishing the
exterior of any building; or anything else that affects or changes the exterior
or color of any building, or the creation, altering, removing, redesigning or
substantial reconfiguration of any parking lot, park area, landscaping or
exterior pedestrian facilities.
   (C)   Standards. No person, firm, corporation or any other organization or
entity, collectively referred to herein as a developer, shall develop any real
property, or any building or other improvements on any real property within
this Downtown Development Zoning District unless the development complies with
the external design standards set below.
      (1)   The Main Street Development Plan must include the following
development requirements.
         (a)   Building organization. Building shall have a consistent pattern
to adjacent structures. There shall be a repetitive scale, massing and
relationship to the street, and style to the area. Corner buildings shall match
or exceed the height of adjacent buildings. The two facades shall be
acknowledged with consistent materials and patterns. Projects with public or
cultural significance shall be designed to have a character that varies more
than the standard pattern to distinguish them as a landmark structure.
         (b)   Setbacks. No setback is required and the building shall be
placed to maintain the street edge. The relationship of the building to the
street edge shall emphasize the pedestrian and not the automobile. Pedestrian
spaces such as sidewalk dining or shaded seating are encouraged.
         (c)   Massing and proportion. Buildings shall have vertical
proportions consistent with existing structures within the block area. Windows
and storefront glazing shall be divided to be either square or vertical in
proportion so that each section is taller than it is wide. Permitted frontal
setbacks can be used to articulate bays of a building to break up its width.
Architectural features such as but not limited to columns, piers, rooflines and
brick can be used to divide and create a vertical orientation on building
facades.
         (d)   Building height and roof type. Buildings in the downtown
district have traditionally used straight edged parapets with sloped roofs
behind. Simple parapet roof edges with varying coping and cornice shall be used
and roof coverings shall be of traditional materials.
         (e)   Facade. Each facade shall have a rhythm that is repeated through
the pattern of wall openings. The building facade shall have an identifiable
base, body, and a cap with horizontal elements separating these components.
Buildings shall not have blank side walls creating a false front appearance.
Corner buildings shall have two facades which maintain a relationship to each
other, but they do not need to be identical.
         (f)   Facade at street level. The street level facade shall provide
human scaled entries including but limited to recessed entries, adjacent store
front windows and sheltering elements. Facades shall incorporate a minimum of
two continuous feature details of 12 inches or less within ten feet of building
wall measured vertically from street level.
         (g)   Windows. Windows shall be vertically oriented with 70% of the
street level facade being transparent. Upper floors shall have a minimum of 35%
per cent of window transparency blending with adjacent buildings. Window
embellishments are encouraged creating additional character to the building.
Overall vertical building proportions shall be expressed in the window
proportions and expanses of vertical windows which give the overall appearance
of horizontal massing shall be avoided.
         (h)   Color. All exterior body and trim colors must harmoniously blend
and compliment with adjacent buildings as well as the district.
         (i)   Signs. All signs must comply with §
155.044 sign requirements of the Zoning Code of the City of Washington. Hanging
signs shall be located below the second floor windows and be harmonious and
consistent to the district.

Street District.
      (2)   Non-residential outside of main street district.
         (a)   Building organization. Buildings shall have a consistent pattern
to adjacent structures. There shall be a repetitive scale, massing,
relationship to the street, and style to the others in the area. Corner
buildings shall match or exceed the height of adjacent buildings. The two
facades shall be acknowledged with consistent materials and patterns. Projects
with public or cultural significance shall be designed to have a character that
varies more from the standard pattern to distinguish them as a landmark
structure.
         (b)   Setbacks. No setback is required and the building shall be
placed to maintain the street edge. The relationship of the building to the
street edge shall emphasize the pedestrian and not the automobile. Pedestrian
spaces such as sidewalk dining or shaded seating are encouraged.
         (c)   Massing and proportion. Buildings shall have vertical
proportions consistent with existing structures within the block area.
         (d)   Building height and roof type. The roof lines shall vary from
building to building as well as within buildings with wide street frontage. The
varying heights shall follow logical building massing and shall correspond to
building organization of the district.
         (e)   Facade. Each facade shall have an identifiable base, body and
cap with horizontal elements separating these components. Buildings shall not
have blank side walls creating a false front appearance. Corner buildings shall
two facades which maintain a relationship to each other, although they do not
need to be identical.
         (f)   Facade at street level. The street level facade shall provide
human scaled entries including but not limited to recessed entries, sheltering
elements and adjacent store front windows.
         (g)   Windows. Windows shall be vertically oriented with a minimum of

the I-69 Corridor Overlay Zone to inspect the landscaping and check it against
the approved plan on file.
   (K)   Parking requirements.
      (1)   Parking is to be discouraged between the greenbelt and the building
(s) when other suitable areas for parking exist on the property; however,
private parking may be permitted in the area between the greenbelt and the
planting adjacent to the building(s) and the planting on the periphery of the
property.
      (2)   Efforts to break up large expanses of pavement are to be encouraged
if possible.
      (3)   The number of parking spaces required are as established in City of
Washington Zoning Ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land
use.
      (4)   Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted
to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do
not coincide in time and thereby may be granted to developments which have a
mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and
thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared
justification for seeking exceptions (i.e., a reference such as shared parking,
Urban Land Institute).
      (5)   There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible
to the building(s) and identified as reserved for use by disabled individuals,
and these spaces shall be of sufficient width (minimum of 12 feet) to
accommodate their needs.
   (L)   Lighting requirements. In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot
proposed to be developed, factors to be considered by the Commission shall
include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Safety provided by the lighting;
      (2)   Security provided by the lighting;
      (3)   Possible light spillage or place onto adjoining properties or
streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining
properties is prohibited.);

with the overall treatment of the property;
      (5)   Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use; and
      (6)   Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design and
the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a
design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall
be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided.
   (M)   Access to individual sites.
      (1)   I-69 Corridor. The I-69, by its functional nature, is a limited
access highway. Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic
movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of
the corridor's primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access
roads, and distributor roads, will have to be built. The roads shall be
coordinated with those of contiguous lots and designed to preserve the
aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear
of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in
the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever
possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the I-69
Corridor.
      (2)   Curb cuts.
         (a)   No more than one for each 400 feet of frontage, except as may be
specifically approved by the City Engineer.

commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by
the Washington Plan Commission or its duly appointed or designated
representative.
   (O)   Other standards.
      (1)   Outside storage prohibited. No outside, unenclosed storage of
refuse (whether or not in containers) or outdoor display of merchandise shall
be permitted on any lot. All refuse shall be contained completely within the
principle or accessory building(s). Exceptions to this requirement will be made
on a case by case basis by the Plan Commission or its duly appointed or
designate representative.
      (2)   Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirement shall be as
specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or
unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by
landscaping or other screening.
      (3)   Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses
which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted,
except that the detached accessory building on any lot shall be architecturally
compatible with the principal building(s) with which it is associated. All
accessory buildings shall have a roof.
      (4)   Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a
hard surface such as asphalt or concrete.
      (5)   If any building or other structure is damaged or destroyed by fire

§ 155.056 EMPLOYMENT ZONING (EZ) PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose, intent and authority.
      (1)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to
establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings,
signs, street hardware and other improvements that are visible to the public
and affect the physical development of land within the Employment Zoning (EZ)
Planned Unit Development District (the “EZ District”).
      (2)   Statement of intent. These standards are intended:
         (a)   To promote high quality creative development that will combine
imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in
the EZ District;
         (b)   To preserve and enhance property values and to promote the
public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent and coordinated
treatment of the property' encompassed by the EZ District;
         (c)   To brand a new name, identity, and benchmark for quality
development for the EZ District;
         (d)   To strictly limit and manage access within the EZ District to
ensure long-term safety and travel efficiency, and to prevent design challenges
for highway designers in pursuit of improving the other roads within the EZ
District;
         (e)   To protect environmentally sensitive areas within the EZ
District, and to provide a filter for increased storm water runoff from the
anticipated increase in impervious surfaces;
         (f)   To promote an “employment corridor” that is cohesive and
aesthetically pleasing, targets larger scale economic development, and is
collectively master planned; and
         (g)   To discourage general commercial development (e.g. retail and
entertainment) within the EZ District, except in a form that is complementary
to and integrated with preexisting employment development (i.e. that primarily
serves the employees and companies).
      (3)   Authority. Authority underlying creation of the EZ District
pursuant to the adoption of a PUD District Ordinance is provided for in I.C.
36-7-4-201 et seq., I.C. 36-7-4-601 et seq., and I.C. 36-7-4-1501 et seq.
   (B)   Statement of significance.
      (1)   Interstate Highway 69 (“I-69") is a four-lane, limited access
federal interstate highway that runs through the east side of the City of
Washington within the city's planning jurisdiction, and some of which is
included within the corporate limits of the city following recent annexation
initiatives. Inasmuch as this highway corridor is experiencing increasing
pressure for commercial and industrial development, the Commission and Council
hereby find that the anticipated development of this highly visible corridor,
along with the surrounding areas, will dramatically change the image of the
City of Washington.
      (2)   The Commission and Council further find that the visibility and
accessibility of the land within the corridor and surrounding areas is unique
and therefore commands the highest standards of development which stimulate
substantial capital investments; therefore, the provisions of this section
shall be interpreted so as to encourage efficient land use, promote coordinated
development, permit innovative site designs, establish exceptional development
standards, and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor and
surrounding areas.
   (C)   Title. This section of the zoning code shall be known as the
Employment Zoning Planned Unit Development District and may be so cited and
pleaded and shall be referred to herein as the “EZ District”.
   (D)   Conflict; severability.
      (1)   If any portion of this section establishing the EZ District is
found to be in conflict with any other provisions of any zoning, building,
fire, safety or health ordinance of the City of Washington, the provision which
establishes the higher standard shall prevail.
      (2)   If any subsection, division, subdivision, sentence, clause or
phrase of this section establishing the EZ District or its application to any
person or circumstance is held invalid by the decision of any court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the provisions establishing this EZ
District or the application of the provisions to other persons or circumstances
shall remain in effect and shall remain in full force.
      (3)   Any property that was located within the boundaries that were
previously established for either:
         (a)   The U.S. 50 Bypass Overlay Zone by §
155.051; or
         (b)   The I-69 Corridor Overlay Zone by §
155.055, Appendix 1 hereof, which property is now located within the boundaries
established below for the EZ District pursuant to Appendix 2A and 2B, or within
such boundaries as may hereafter be established for the EZ District pursuant to
Appendix 3, shall be governed solely by the provisions of this section.
Accordingly, this section shall be interpreted to supersede the provisions of
§§
155.051 and
155.055 insofar as they relate to any such property.
   (E)   Jurisdiction. This section shall apply to the zoning jurisdictional
area of the City of Washington, Indiana as defined below.
   (F)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning. These definitions shall be construed as supplemental to the
general definitions for this zoning code which are contained in §
155.006.
      ADLS REQUIREMENTS. The development requirements set forth in this section

applicable to a particular development. However, a waiver that makes a major
modification in a development requirement may not be made except after a public
hearing conducted by the Plan Commission, and on the condition that all three
of the following findings are made:
      (1)   Harmony. The waiver shall be in harmony with the general statements
of purpose, intent, and significance which are set forth above in divisions (A)
and (B) of this section.
      (2)   Access. The waiver shall not produce a site plan or circulation
system that would be impractical or detract from the appearance of the
development, or detract from the appearance of the EZ District generally, nor
shall it adversely affect emergency vehicle access, nor shall it deprive
neighboring properties of adequate light and air.
      (3)   Site design. The waiver shall result in enhanced site design
characteristics, such as but not limited to any of the following: increased
landscaping treatment, tree preservation, public art, provisions for bicycle
access, or reduced surface parking with provisions for above or below ground
parking facilities.
   (Q)   Waivers; minor modifications. The Plan Commission or Plan Review Group
may, in apublic meeting held in accordance with the Indiana Open Door Law (I.C.
5-14-1.5-1 et seq.), grant a waiver that makes a minor modification in a
development requirement without conducting a public hearing or publishing any
notice. For the purposes of I.C. 36-7-4-1511(i) and this division (Q), “minor
modifications” that may be made without a public hearing are modifications that
do not exceed 35% of any dimensional or quantitative standard set forth in this
section. All other modifications shall be considered “major modifications” and
subject to division (P) of this section.
   (R)   Appeals. Any Plan Commission or Plan Review Group decision made under
this section may be appealed within 30 days thereof to the Council, which shall
then conduct a public hearing on the matter, upon the same notice as is
required in division (G)(1) for a public hearing on the concept plan, and make
the final decision on the concept plan, the ADLS application, the major
modification, or the minor modification, as the case may be.
   (S)   Commitments. In connection with the approval of a concept plan as
provided in division (G)(1), the Plan Commission may require or allow the owner
of the affected real estate to make a commitment to the Commission concerning
the use or development of the real estate, in accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-1015.
In connection with the granting of a waiver or modification as provided in
division (P) or (Q), the Plan Commission or Plan Review Group may require or
allow the owner of the affected real estate to make a commitment to the
Commission concerning the use or development of the real estate, in accordance
with I.C. 36-7-4-1015.
   (T)   Variances. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of an owner
of real estate under Indiana law to petition the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
variance from development standards, as provided in I.C. 36-7-4-918.5 and this
zoning code. Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of this zoning
code which govern nonconforming uses, or the authority of the Board of Zoning
Appeals to determine nonconforming use issues under I.C. 36-7-4-1019 and §
155.041 of this zoning code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 155.065 BUILDING COMMISSIONER TO HAVE AUTHORITY.
   The Building Commissioner is hereby designated and authorized to enforce
this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 156.30) (Am. Ord. 8-86, passed 7-14-1986)
§ 155.066 POWERS AND DUTIES OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER; COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   The Building Commissioner, as appointed by the Mayor, shall have the
delegated authority of the Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals to
effectuate any and all rules and regulations promulgated or otherwise passed by
the Commission and Board as set forth in this subchapter. In addition to these
powers, the Building Commissioner shall be empowered to enforce the repair or
removal of any structure or the clean-up of any premises pursuant to the
provisions of
Chapter 150 and/or the removal of any abandoned vehicles pursuant to
Chapter 90.
   (B)   In addition to the above powers and authorities of the Building
Commissioner, the Building Commissioner shall likewise be responsible for the
issuance of any and all building permits in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and insure compliance therewith, and be empowered to collect
monies therefor. The Building Commissioner shall likewise be empowered to
process any and all petitions and applications requiring action of either the
Plan Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals, collect monies therefor as fees
shall be established in § 155.071, and the collection of monies as set forth
above.
   (C)   The Building Commissioner shall also be empowered to effectuate
compliance with any and all appropriate and recognized methods of electrical
wiring both in new and used structures, as well as the appropriate and
recognized methods of construction, both of new structures, and adding or
remodeling of used structures, and effectuating other rules and regulations
regarding the safety of the structure, its habitability or compliance with
existing rules and regulations for public use. This section in no way delegates
authority to the Building Commissioner any more powers than are allowed or
permissible under the provisions of the city code or the state statutes, nor is
the Building Commissioner empowered to enforce any state rules or regulations
or statutes if the state has authorized agents to so do, but empowers the
Building Commissioner to work with state agents and pursue the powers and
authority as can properly be delegated to him or her in compliance with, and in
conformity to this section. Pursuant to I.C. 36-1-7-3, the Building
Commissioner may, in conjunction with the Mayor, negotiate an interlocal
cooperation agreement with one or more other governmental entities under which
the city and other entity or entities jointly exercise the power to inspect the
construction of new structures, and additions to or remodeling of used
structures, in order to ensure that such construction, addition, or remodeling
is completed in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations for public
use. Any such agreement is subject to the approval of the Council as provided
in I.C. 36-1-7-4.
   (D)   Any noncompliance on the part of any individual with the rules and
regulations as shall be promulgated by the Building Commissioner regarding
building codes or electrical codes, as those rules and regulations shall be
approved by the Plan Commission, shall be subject to the withdrawal of any
permit issued by the Building Commissioner, which will cause the individual to
cease and desist until compliance is effectuated, and if the individual fails
or refuses to so cease and desist, then the city may take any and all
appropriate action as set forth in this subchapter deeming the building to be a
nuisance, pursuing equitable remedies as enjoining an individual, pursuing
legal remedies as suing for damages or any or all other legal/equitable
remedies permitted under the statutes of the state. In addition thereto, the
nonconforming individual shall be subject to the penalty provisions set forth
in this chapter.

155.999
§ 155.067 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMITS.
   (A)   Any person, persons, firms or corporations which shall make
application for an improvement location permit shall, at the time of making the
application, furnish the Building Commissioner with a site plan of the real
estate upon which the application for an improvement location permit is made,
at least 5 days prior to the issuance of the improvement location permit, which
5 day period may be waived by the Building Commissioner. The site plan shall be
drawn to scale showing the following items:
      (1)   A legal description of the real estate involved;
      (2)   Location and size of all buildings and structures;
      (3)   Width and length of all entrances and exits to and from the real
estate; and
      (4)   All adjacent and adjoining roads or highways.
   (B)   Site plans so furnished to the Building Commissioner shall be filed by
the Building Commissioner, and shall become a permanent record.
   (C)   The Building Commissioner may require the relocation of any proposed
building or structure or exit or entrance shown on the site plan and/or the
location of new exits or entrances not shown on the site plan before issuing an
improvement location permit when the action is necessary to carry out the
purpose and intent of this chapter.
   (D)   The Building Commissioner shall issue an improvement location permit
for a conditional use only following receipt of notice from the Board that the
application therefor has been approved by the Board.
   (E)   Any person, to whom is issued an improvement location permit pursuant
to division (D) above, who fails to commence construction of an authorized
industrial park or shopping center within 24 months after the permit is issued,
or who fails to carry to completion 30% of the total development plan thereof
within 3 years after the permit is issued, or within 1 year after construction
is begun, whichever is later, or who fails to conform to the provisions of the
development plan and supporting data finally approved by the Board, and upon
the basis of which the improvement location permit was issued, may be required
by the Board upon its own motion, and shall be required by the Board upon
written petition of any person deeming himself or herself aggrieved, to show
cause why approval should not be withdrawn and the permit revoked; provided,
however, that no order to show cause shall be issued for failure to commence
construction within 24 months after construction has in fact commenced, even
though commenced after the expiration of the 24-month period.
      (1)   Upon the determination by the Board or petition by the person to
require the holder of the permit to show cause pursuant to the provisions of
division (A)(1) of this section, the Board shall set the same for public
hearing, and cause written notice thereof to be sent by registered mail to the
permit holder and to be published according to laws. The notice shall name a
day not less than 10 days after the date the notice is mailed and after the
second of the publication upon which the hearing will be held.
      (2)   If, after the hearing, upon evidence publicly presented to the
Board by members of the public or officers or employees of the city, including
members of the Board present at the hearing, the Board shall find that the
holder of the permit in question has failed to commence construction of the
industrial park or shopping center within 24 months from the date the
improvement location permit was issued, has failed to carry to completion 30%
of the total development plan within 3 years after the date, or has failed
materially to conform to the provisions of the development plan and supporting
data finally approved by the Board and upon the basis of which the improvement
location permit was issued, the Board shall withdraw its approval of the
development plan, and order the permit revoked; provided, however, that the
Board may, if it deems the failure correctable within a period of 6 months,
extend the time within which the period holder may purge himself or herself of
such failure for not longer than the period, during which period the hearing
shall be continued to a day certain at the end thereof.
   (F)   Not more than 1 improvement location permit for each C-3 District
symbol on the zone map may be issued and outstanding at any 1 time.
   (G)   In the event the Board shall revoke an improvement location permit
under the authority of division (E)(2), it may thereafter grant approval for
another shopping center development in the same C-3 District subject to all of
the provisions and requirements of this chapter.
   (H)   The holder of an improvement location permit for an industrial park or
shopping center may apply to the Board at any time for an alteration, change,
amendment or extension of the development plan upon which the permit is based.
      (1)   Upon receipt of the application, the Board shall proceed as in the
case of original application for conditional uses.
      (2)   In the event the Board shall approve and order the development plan
changed, altered, amended or extended, it shall so notify the Building
Commissioner, who shall issue an amended improvement location permit
accordingly.
   (I)   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building hereafter created,
reconstructed or structurally altered shall be occupied or used, in whole or in
part, for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate of occupancy shall have
been issued by the Building Commissioner stating that the building and use
comply with all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the building or
premises or the use in the district in which it is to be located.
   (J)   No change in use shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or
hereafter erected, reconstructed or structurally altered, without a certificate
of occupancy having been issued by the Building Commissioner, and no permit
shall be issued to make the change unless it is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (K)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for coincidentally with
the application of an improvement location permit, and shall be issued within
10 days after the lawful erection, reconstruction or structural alteration of
the building shall have been completed.
   (L)   A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the
office of the Building Commissioner, and copies shall be furnished upon request
to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land
affected.
   (M)   No improvement location permit shall be issued for excavation for, or
the erection, reconstruction or structural alteration of any building, before
application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.

detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements
in the vicinity and district in which the property is located; and/or
      (4)   That the granting of the variance will not alter the land use
characteristics of the vicinity and district, diminish the marketable value of
adjacent land and improvements or increase the congestion in the public
streets.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene materials.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986);
California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479
U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v.
City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County,
793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington,, 65 F.3d 1248
(5th Cir.1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d
608 (11th Cir.1984), as well as studies conducted in other cities including,
but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles,
California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in
the Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986),
the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group On the Regulation Of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics
obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the City Council finds that:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-
related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually
oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix,
Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report
of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
      (4)   Offering and providing booths and/or cubicles encourages
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books,
Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General’s
Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida.
      (7)   For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported
cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
was 523,056 See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      (8)   As of ___________, 199__, there have been _______ reported cases of
AIDS in the State of ____________.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in [state
of] ____________.
      (10)   The total number of cases of early (less than 1 year) syphilis in
the United States reported during the ten year period 1985-1995 was 367,796
See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported
during the period 1993-1995 See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected
blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids,
including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented
businesses where persons view adult oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of
the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
      (16)   Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution,
increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).
      (17)   Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of
drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d
1053, 1056 (9th Cir.1986).
      (18)   The findings noted in paragraphs numbered (1) through (17) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (19)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (20)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
the sexually oriented businesses. Further, the licensing procedure will place a
heretofore non-existent incentive on operators to see that the sexually
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (21)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest
in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult
establishments.
      (22)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
      (23)   It is desirable, in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent, or who are
likely to be witnesses to this activity.
      (24)   The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business
license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to
this chapter.
      (25)   The barring of individuals from operation or employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of 10 years for a previous felony
conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (26)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
this city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

coverings in viewing booths to be nonporous, easily cleanable surfaces, with no
rugs or carpeting.
   (N)   The operator of the sexually oriented business shall cause all wall
surfaces and ceiling surfaces in viewing booths to be constructed of, or
permanently covered by, nonporous, easily cleanable material. No wood, plywood,
composition board or other porous material shall be used within 48 inches of
the floor.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES
§ 157.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council of the City of Washington does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2-2021, passed 2-8-2021)
§ 157.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Washington are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2-2021, passed 2-8-2021)
§ 157.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2-2021, passed 2-8-2021)
§ 157.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2-2021, passed 2-8-2021)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.10 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is
subject to the 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any

180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or

velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information. This certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES). The exceptional hardship that would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Washington
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and,
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929 AS CORRECTED IN 1929. A
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88) AS ADOPTED IN 1993. A
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to affect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is (a) built on a single chassis; (b)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
(c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck;
and (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters
for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in § 157.12. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term base
flood, 1% annual chance flood, and 100-year flood.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdictions of
the City of Washington subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The City
of Washington does not currently have a published FEMA map. The SFHAs of those
parts of unincorporated Daviess County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city are generally
identified as such on the Daviess County Indiana Uninc. Areas Flood Hazard
Boundary Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated May
5, 1978. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH,
AR, A99, or AO). The SFHA may also be identified by best available data
regulatory data maps (best available flood layer) provided by, or approved by,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in

displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2-2021, passed 2-8-2021)
§ 157.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
157.12, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
157.40 through
157.47 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This ADVERSE AFFECT is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
