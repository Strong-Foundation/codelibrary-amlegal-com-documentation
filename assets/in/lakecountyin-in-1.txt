§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the "Lake
County Code," for which designation "Code of Ordinances," "Codified
Ordinances," or "Code" may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment
thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and effect, as if it
had not been repealed by this code. All rules and regulations adopted under
laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or
context of the provision.
      (1)   Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary, and
usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. The Board of Commissioners of Lake County.

      COUNCIL. The County Council of Lake County, Indiana.

copartnership, trustee, lessee, receiver, and bodies politic. Whenever used in
any clause prescribing and imposing a penalty, the terms PERSON or WHOEVER as
applied to any unincorporated entity shall mean the partners or members
thereof, and as applied to corporations, the officers or agents thereof.
      PRECEDING and FOLLOWING. When referring to sections or divisions in this
code, refer to the sections or divisions next following or next preceding that
in which the words occur, unless some other section is designated.
      WRITTEN and IN WRITING. Include printing, lithographing, or other modes
of representing words and letters. Where the written signature of a person is

mark.
      YEAR. One calendar year, unless otherwise expressly provided.
(I.C. 1-1-4-5(a))
§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) of this section does not affect the
operation of division (B) with respect to that act.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and
effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.14 ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE.
   (A)   If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed
following the text of the code section. Example:

§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS, AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties
incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The
liabilities, proceedings, and rights are continued; punishments, penalties, or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.
In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-
way, contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance,
establishment, or vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate
officers shall remain valid in all respects, as if this code had not been
enacted.

question of representation exists, it shall direct an election by secret ballot
within 30 days and shall certify the results within ten days. An employees'
organization will be certified as the collective bargaining unit if it received
a majority of over 50% of the votes of the employees in the unit of county
government eligible to vote. The County Commissioners may set aside the vote
and declare a new vote if it determines a free and untrammeled election was not
conducted because of unfair labor practices.
   (C)   In the event that more than one employee organization is seeking
certification:
      (1)   Only those employees' organizations which have been designated by
more than 10% of the full-time employees in the unit of county government
eligible to vote shall be placed on the ballot;
      (2)   If, after an election, one of the employees' organizations did not
receive a majority of over 50% of the votes, but all the employees'
organizations on the ballot, in the aggregate, did receive over 50% of the
votes, of the full-time employees in the unit of county government eligible to
vote, a second election shall be held and only the employees' organization
receiving the majority of the votes among all the employees' organizations
shall remain on the ballot; and
      (3)   If after an election the employees' organizations, in the
aggregate, did not receive over 50% of the votes, of the full-time employees in
the unit of county government eligible to vote, no further election is required
and no employees' organization shall be certified.
   (D)   An election shall not be held with any employees' organization or
collective bargaining unit or with any subdivision thereof, with which a valid
election has been held in the preceding 24-month period.
   (E)   In the event that at the adoption of this subchapter, the County
Commissioners have recognized or certified an employee organization as the
exclusive representative of a unit of county government, the existing
collective bargaining agreement with the employee organization shall remain in
effect, and there shall be no election during the term of the agreement.

§ 32.028 BARGAINING UNIT.

included in a bargaining unit. County employees with supervisory duties,
probationary employees, confidential employees, and all other employees shall

county employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote,
discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or the responsibility
to direct other employees, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to
recommend the action, if in connection with the foregoing, the exercise of the
authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use
of independent judgment.
      (2)   CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES means an employee whose unrestricted access
to confidential personnel files or whose functional responsibilities or
knowledge in connection with the issues involved in dealings between the
employer and its employees would make his or her membership in an employee
organization incompatible with his or her official duties.

§ 32.029 UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.
   (A)   It shall be an unfair labor practice for a county employer to:

choosing and to engage in other legal activities, individually, or in concert,
for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, or improving terms and conditions
of employment;
      (2)   Dominate, interfere with or assist in the formation or

join, or assist employee organizations to participate in collective bargaining
with county employers through representatives of their own choosing and to
engage in other legal activities, individually, or in concert, for the purpose
of establishing, maintaining, or improving terms and conditions of employment.
      (2)   Restrain or coerce a county employer in the selection of his or her
representative for the purpose of collective bargaining or the adjustment of
grievances;

Conciliation Service to assign a mediator or, in the alternative, the parties
may request a list of five mediators from which each party shall alternate in
striking names until only one name is left, which person shall be the mediator.
The recommendation and action of the mediator shall be advisory only and shall
have no binding authority or effect on any of the parties. Any costs shall be
shared equally by the parties.
   (B)   The parties may mutually agree to any other method of selecting an
advisory mediator provided the method is likely to result in the selection of
an impartial and knowledgeable mediator.
(Ord. 1199B, passed 1-18-2000)

against a county employer.
   (B)   Any county employer may, in an action at law, suit, or in equity or

organization, any affiliate thereof, or any person aiding or abetting in any
action specified in division (A) above for redress of the unlawful act.
   (C)   Where any exclusive representative engages in any action specified in

The Lake County Employee Handbook is a guide that describes the procedures and
regulations that relate to your employment and has been prepared to assist you
in making your employment enjoyable and rewarding.
In order to insure that the County's employment records are accurate, please
notify your department's payroll clerk should you at any time change your name,
address, telephone number, or marital/family status.
Although the handbook is designed to serve all employees in an equitable and
fair manner, parts of this book may be superseded by union agreement or by
specific department procedure. Wherever possible, those conflicts have been
noted.
POLICY DISCLAIMER
This handbook has been prepared for the employees of Lake County to promote and
maintain a positive working environment and to provide general direction and
information. Since it is not possible for this handbook to cover each and every
aspect of employment, the policies, procedures and benefits described in this
handbook are summary descriptions, presented for information only, and are not
intended to be all encompassing or applicable to every situation. Although this
handbook has in itself been adopted as an ordinance, it may also provide
summaries of County ordinances which are on file with the City Council.
Additionally, departments may implement additional policies or procedures as
authorized by this handbook.
Neither this handbook nor any other written or oral statement made to an
employee by a representative of the County is intended to be an actual or
implied contract unless reduced in writing, signed by the appropriate
department head and explicitly stated in writing that the document is intended
to serve as a contract.
Although the County wishes to make every effort to maintain continuity in its
policies and the way it handles personnel issues, it retains the right to add,
modify or terminate its policies, procedures or benefits at any time should a
situation arise where such change is necessary to preserve appropriate
operations. In those instances, changes shall be immediately applicable to all
employees regardless of whether the change conflicts with previous language
contained in the handbook and whether or not notice was given prior to the
change in policy was made.
Unless covered by contractual agreement, all County employees are employees “at
will,” and are free to resign at any time, just as the County is free to
terminate that employment at any time pursuant to County policy. Neither this
handbook nor any other written or oral statements of County policy is intended
to modify the “at will” status of an individual's employment.
As noted earlier, employees who are represented by collective bargaining are
also subject to the provisions of this handbook unless otherwise defined or
addressed by written contract or agreement. In those instances, the contractual
language (or written agreement) will supersede the terms of the handbook.
All benefits granted to an employee as a result of his/her employment with the
County are subject to change without notice if those changes are necessary to
comply with state or federal law or if amended by the County due to budgetary
constraint.
UNIFORM APPLICATION OF THIS HANDBOOK
It is the intent of the County Council to adopt an employee handbook that
applies uniformly to all divisions of government except the Judiciary (which
are employees of the Indiana 31st Judicial District) Park Department, merit
correctional officers and merit police officers, each of which maintain their
own handbooks or are covered by collective bargaining. The handbook applies to
employees of the Highway Department unless it conflicts with that department's
collective bargaining agreement or mutually agreed to work rules. Although this
handbook makes reference to the Board of Commissioners, employees of other
divisions of County Government including the Lake County Auditor, Treasurer,
Coroner, Recorder, Assessor, Surveyor, Clerk, Sheriff and Township Assessors
should substitute the chief elected official of that division for references to
“Board of Commissioners” except where such authority is expressly granted to
the Board of Commissioners by ordinance or state statute.
SECTION 1- GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
§ 1.1 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
   (A)   In order to implement Lake County's policy of equal employment
opportunity, an affirmative action plan will be developed annually for
implementation.
   (B)   Although it has been the long-standing policy of the County to provide
equal opportunity to all qualified persons without regard to race, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, physical challenge/disability, genetic information,
veteran's status or anything else that has no bearing on job performance, Lake
County is committed to the identification and elimination of those barriers
which have denied equal employment opportunities to protected class members. In
addition, the affirmative action plan will set specific goals and timetables
that provide realistic, achievable opportunities for improving the employment
opportunities for protected classes.
   (C)   In addition to eliminating barriers for employment, the EEO Policy and
Affirmative Action Plan also apply to contractors, vendors and service
suppliers seeking a public contract to do business with the County. Contractors
and vendors will be required to demonstrate compliance with the County's policy
and Affirmative Action Plan.
   (D)   Additional measures outlining the County's commitment to affirmative
action may be further defined in federal and state grant applications. County
employees who are responsible for handling the purchase of contracted services
should become familiar with the specific goals and requirements of the County's
Affirmative Action Plan.
   (E)   A copy of the County's plan is on file and available for review in the
Lake County Auditor's Office.
§ 1.2 CIVIL RIGHTS
   (A)   It is the policy of the County to provide an internal complaint and
investigation procedure to encourage early resolution of an alleged civil
rights violation based on employee complaints within the organization and to
monitor policies, practices and actions. This policy is in addition to any
existing grievance and complaint procedures.
   (B)   Any employee who feels that he/she has received unfair treatment in
discipline, pay, promotion or assignment because of his/her race, color, sex,
sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, political
affiliation, disability, genetic information, or veteran's status may file a
complaint.
   (C)   The County's Grievance Committee will receive and investigate all
complaints of a discriminatory nature. Utilizing this procedure will not
preclude any other internal grievance or complaint procedure; however,
utilizing an external complaint procedure, such as filing with the State Civil
Rights or the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will preclude use of
the internal procedure due to superseding authority.
   (D)   Departments and divisions of County government are encouraged to
create internal anti-discrimination practices that improve communication and
voluntary compliance with the County's civil rights policy. Corrective action
may be directed by the Grievance Committee or the Board of Commissioners (or
other elected official) when voluntary methods fail.
   (E)   Investigative Compliance - Due to the seriousness of a civil rights
violation, employees, department heads, managers and elected officials shall
cooperate with complaint investigations by meeting at a reasonable time and
place and providing information requested by the Grievance Committee. Attempts
to frustrate this process or take retribution on employees for utilizing this
process will not be tolerated, and proven cases may result in disciplinary
action against an appointed board member, department head or supervisor
involved.
   (F)   Complaints must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the
alleged discriminatory action.
§ 1.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST
   (A)   It is important that the County avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest in its ability to function and specifically in the activities of
County employees. In order to avoid an actual conflict or the appearance of a
conflict, a series of guidelines based on County ordinance and State law (IC
35-44-1-3) have been developed and adopted to guide County employees, elected
officials and appointed board members:
      (1)   It is improper for an employee to sell or provide at additional
cost any goods or services to any other County departments except as the result
of an open bidding process in which such goods or services are subject to
control of another party.
      (2)   It may be a conflict of interest within the scope of this policy to
engage in outside consulting activities while an employee of a department doing
business in any manner with the firm with which the employee consults.
Therefore, any such consulting activities by paid County employees must be
reported in writing and approved by the Board of Commissioner's Office. Failure
to comply may result in disciplinary action including termination. Other
elected officials shall also file a Conflict of Interest form with the
appropriate governing authority.
      (3)   County employees shall not use their position to obtain gifts or
favors from vendors. This policy shall exclude lunches or gifts of $100.00 or
less in value, or group dinners and social activities sponsored by a vendor at
a conference or convention. Should an employee be unsure as to whether a gift
is in violation of the policy, the employee should seek clarification from the
County Attorney's Office.
      (4)   It is illegal to accept a bribe (money, goods, an item of value,
property, privilege or promise which is offered or given with a corrupt intent
to influence an action, vote or opinion) in return for influencing the awarding
of a contract purchase of goods or services, or to influence performance of
County services.
   (B)   Disciplinary action will be taken for proven violations of this policy
in accordance with the County's progressive discipline policy. Discipline will
be based on the severity of the problem and previous incidents on record.
§ 1.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST GOVERNING LEGAL SERVICES.
   (A)   The County has the right to prohibit activity it deems in conflict of
interest with county employment. Activities of employees are to be monitored by
the employees' department head or elected officials.
      (1)   Neither a county employee whose job description includes the
provision of legal services nor any person, partnership or corporation of any
type, acting as a contract agent to provide legal services for the county, its
elected officials, its appointed officials, employees, departments, agencies or
agents shall represent any person, partnership or corporation of any type in
any manner in or out of court proceeding, claim, or action where the legal
services provided for the client seek in part legal redress against the county,
its elected officials, its appointed officials, employees, departments agencies
or agents.
      (2)   Neither a county employee whose job description includes the
provision of legal services nor any person, partnership or corporation of any
type, acting as a contract agent to provide legal services for anyone charged
with a crime in any state or county court in the County of Lake, shall
represent any person, partnership or corporation of any type in any manner in
or out of court in a proceeding, claim or action where the legal services
provide for the client seek in part legal redress against the County of Lake,
its elected officials, its appointed officials, employees, departments,
agencies or agents.
   (B)   The prohibition against legal representation outlined in the paragraph
above shall be placed in all county contracts for legal services. If the
restriction on legal representation is violated, the contract with the county
shall be null and void and any monies paid on the contract after the violation
shall be deemed unearned and shall be paid to the county with eight percent
(8%) interest.
§ 1.5 DISABLED EMPLOYEES/AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
   (A)   The County supports and adheres to the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 (ADA) which makes it unlawful to discriminate in employment against a
qualified individual with a disability. The ADA also outlaws discrimination
against individuals with disabilities in State and local government services,
public accommodations, transportation and telecommunications. Any employee who
wishes to discuss his or her needs as a disabled employee should contact the
department head.
   (B)   ADA Protection
      (1)   An employee with disability and qualified to do a job is protected
by the ADA from job discrimination on the basis of that disability. Under the
ADA, a disability includes a physical or mental impairment that substantially
limits a major life activity. To be protected under the ADA, an employee must
have, or be regarded as having a substantial (as opposed to a minor)
impairment. A substantial impairment is one that significantly limits or
restricts a major life activity such as hearing, seeing, speaking, walking,
breathing, and performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, learning or
working.
      (2)   An employee must also be qualified to perform the essential
functions or duties of a job with or without reasonable accommodation, in order
to be protected from job discrimination by the ADA. This means two things.
First, the employee must satisfy the employer's requirements for the job such
as education, employment experience, skills or licenses. Second, he/she must be
able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable
accommodation. Essential functions are the fundamental job duties that an
employee must be able to perform his/her own or with the help of a reasonable
accommodation. An employer cannot refuse to hire an employee because his/her
disability prevents them from performing duties that are not essential to the
job.
   (C)   Reasonable Accommodation
      (1)   Any change or adjustment to a job or work environment that permits
a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the job
application process, to perform the essential functions of a job, or to enjoy
benefits and application privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by
employees without disabilities. For example, reasonable accommodation may
include:
      Providing or modifying equipment or devices, job restructuring, part-time
or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, adjusting or
modifying examinations, training materials, or policies, providing readers and
interpreters, and making the workplace readily accessible to and usable by
people with disabilities.
      (2)   An employer is required to provide a reasonable accommodation to a
qualified applicant or employee with a disability unless the employer can show
that the accommodation would be an undue hardship - an accommodation that would
require significant difficulty or expense.
      (3)   The results of all medical examinations must be kept confidential
and maintained in separate medical files.
   (D)   Drug Abuse and the ADA - Anyone who is currently using drugs illegally
is not protected by the ADA and may be denied employment or fired on the basis
of such use. The ADA does not prevent employers from testing applicants or
employees for current illegal drug use.
   (E)   For Further Information - Contact the County's ADA Compliance
Committee, County Human Resources Consultant, County Commissioners Attorney's
Office or an EEOC field office.
§ 1.6 DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
   (A)   The County strives to maintain a drug free workplace with a safe and
productive atmosphere to work in and in which to conduct business. No
controlled substance or alcohol is permitted at any worksite, in any County
vehicle, or in the possession of any employee engaged in County business. An
employee who is discovered to be in violation of this policy will immediately
be referred to an employee assistance program, demoted, and/or transferred to a
safer job (if applicable) and be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including discharge.
   (B)   For the safety and welfare of all employees and the general public,
should a supervisor believe that reasonable suspicion exists that an employee
may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, that supervisor is required to
have the employee submit to testing performed by qualified medical personnel.
Testing is also required of any employee who is involved in an accident while
operating a County-owned vehicle. Failure or refusal to submit to a test may
result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. Additional
information regarding an employee's responsibilities in the event of an
accident can be found in “Safety & Health” in the Employee Responsibilities
section of this handbook. The cost of testing an employee will be the County's
responsibility.
   (C)   Employees who operate a County-owned vehicle (this does not apply to
vehicles classified by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles as a passenger vehicle
unless that vehicle has been involved in an accident) and certain jobs within
the County that require high levels of security and safety, may be subject to
random drug testing. All testing will be performed in compliance with Federal
standards and County Ordinance. The results of any test will remain
confidential.
§ 1.7 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
   (A)   Lake County is committed to providing equal employment opportunities
for all applicants and employees. Applicants and employees shall be treated
fairly and equally. Employment decisions will comply with all applicable state
and federal employment discrimination laws and made without regard to race,
color, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, age,
disability, genetic information, veteran's status, political affiliation, or
citizenship. In addition, the County will not tolerate any discrimination by
anyone including, but not limited to, co-workers, supervisors, department
heads, elected or appointed officials, vendors and the general public. This
policy applies to all employment decisions including, but not limited to,
recruiting, hiring, compensation, training, promotion, termination and all
other terms and conditions of employment. Any employee who believes that they
have witnessed or been subjected to discrimination has a duty to immediately
report the incident to the County Human Resources Consultant (219) 853-9782 in
accordance with this policy.
   (B)   It is the official policy of the County to:
      (1)   Recruit, hire and promote for all job classifications without
regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sexual
orientation, political affiliation, veteran's status or disability.
      (2)   Base decisions on employment so as to further the principles of
equal employment opportunity and in accord with the County's affirmative action
plan.
      (3)   Insure that promotion decisions are in accord with the principles
of equal employment opportunity by imposing only job related requirements for
promotional opportunities.
      (4)   Acknowledge its intent to abide by this policy by including the
words “Equal Employment Opportunity Employer” in all recruitment advertising,
and on all County letterhead.
      (5)   Insure that all other personnel actions such as compensation,
benefits, transfers, layoffs, return from layoff, education, County sponsored
training, tuition assistance, social and recreational programs will be
administered without regard to race, color, sex, veteran's status, sexual
orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, political affiliation or
disability.
      (6)   Special meetings will be held at least annually with executive,
management and supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the County's
equal employment opportunity policy, and individual responsibility for
effective implementation, and clarifying the County's position on equal
employment opportunity. The date of these meetings will be recorded and
specified in the County's EEO/Affirmative Action Plan.
   (C)   Any questions regarding equal employment opportunity, potential
discriminatory practices or matters within the scope of County employment
should be directed to the County Human Resources Consultant.
§ 1.8 SEXUAL HARASSMENT
   (A)   The County is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity
for all applicants and employees. The County believes that it is important to
maintain a safe and pleasant work environment. Sexual harassment adversely
impacts the morale and productivity of an employer's most valuable asset, its
employees. In addition, state and federal law protects employees, visitors,
contractors, vendors and all those who enter the workplace from sexual
harassment. The County believes that it shares a responsibility with its
employees, board appointments and elected officials to stop and prevent sexual
harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the workplace.
   (B)   Definition of Sexual Harassment
      (1)   Sexual harassment is generally defined as conduct which shows
disrespect, hostility or aversion to an employee, visitor or contractor through
the use of sex-based comments or actions of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment
may involve verbal, visual or physical conduct which results in an employee or
employees (or others present in the workplace) being subjected to an
environment that is uncomfortable and unnecessary.
      (2)   There are two forms of sexual harassment: hostile work environment
and quid pro quo harassment.
         (a)   Hostile Work Environment - This form of sexual harassment
involves sex-based conduct by a co-worker or a supervisor that creates a
hostile or offensive work environment and which adversely interferes with an
employee's ability to perform his/her work. Examples of a hostile work
environment include (but are not limited to):
            1.   Asking questions or making statements about an employee's
sexual conduct or preferences;
            2.   Exposing oneself or revealing private body parts;
            3.   Engaging in unwelcome physical contact such as pinching,
kissing or inappropriately touching another employee;
            4.   Disseminating or displaying pornographic materials or sexually
explicit photographs;
            5.   Making obscene, sexual gestures.
         (b)   Quid Pro Quo - This type of sexual harassment involves a
supervisor who uses his/her authority to either threaten or require a
subordinate employee to submit to sexual activity as a requirement for either:
continued employment, favorable performance evaluations, or securing
advancement in the County. Examples of quid pro quo harassment include (but are
not limited to) the following examples:
            1.   A supervisor stating to a subordinate employee: "Things could
be a lot easier for you here if you would go away with me for the weekend."
            2.   A supervisor withholding a favorable performance evaluation
from a subordinate employee until the employee gives in to the supervisor's
sexual advances.
      (3)   Although the County does not condone any inappropriate action or
comment, it is important to review the manner and circumstances in which the
actions in question occurred. In determining whether alleged conduct
constitutes sexual harassment, the County will look at the record as a whole
and at the totality of the circumstances.
   (C)   Elected Official/Department Head Responsibilities to Prevent Sexual
Harassment
      (1)   Elected officials and County department heads are responsible for
the acts of their agents and supervisory employees with respect to sexual
harassment. Elected officials and department heads shall be held responsible
for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace, where the employer or its
agents or supervisory employees know or should have known of the conduct, and
failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action to eradicate the
behavior. Elected officials and department heads may also be responsible for
the acts of non-employees in the workplace, where the department management
knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and
appropriate corrective action.
      (2)   Elected officials and County department heads shall take all steps
necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as informing
employees of their right to raise the issue of harassment, developing methods
to sensitize all concerned, and taking appropriate and quick action in response
to a sexual harassment complaint.
      (3)   Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of
an individual's submission to the sexual advances or request for sexual favors,
elected officials and department heads may be held liable for unlawful sex
discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied
employment opportunity or benefit.
      (4)   Proven violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action
up to and including termination based on the severity of the infraction and the
past history. The level of discipline applied will be made on a case by case
basis by the employee's department head or elected official.
   (D)   Reporting Procedure
      (1)   Any employee who reasonably believes that he/she has either
witnessed or been subjected to sexual harassment shall immediately report the
discriminatory conduct to their department head or to the elected official,
Board of Commissioners or County Human Resources Consultant. If neither of
these individuals is available, or the employee is uncomfortable in reporting
the conduct to either individual, the employee may report the discriminatory
conduct to the County Human Resources Consultant.
      (2)   Employees may, at their discretion, make complaints of sexual
harassment to their department head or the County's Human Resource Consultant
(who can be reached at (219) 853-9782). All complaints will be documented in
writing. If the department head takes the complaint, it should immediately be
forwarded to the County Commissioner's Attorney. The complaint shall remain
confidential to the extent possible, subject to the need to conduct an
investigation of the allegations.
   (E)   Investigation and Resolution of Complaint
      (1)   All reports of sexual harassment shall be investigated in a
confidential and expedient manner. However, since it is crucial that an
investigation be conducted, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The
County will not tolerate any retaliation against an employee who makes a good
faith report of sexual harassment. If the investigation reveals that the report
has merit, corrective action, up to and including termination will be taken to
remedy the situation.
      (2)   Internal investigations of sexual harassment shall be conducted by
Human Resources with the full cooperation of department heads. Upon completion
of the investigation, a final written report will be prepared by the department
head or elected official within a reasonable time-frame (in most cases, within
30 days of the original complaint). In accordance with the State's Open Door
Law and federal court ruling, the victim has the right to know what
disciplinary action has been taken.
   (F)   False Claims of Sexual Harassment - As an employer, the County takes
its responsibility to stop sexual harassment very seriously. An employee who
falsely accuses another employee of sexual harassment can create unnecessary
anguish, emotional distress and harm to an innocent employee as well as waste
the County's time and resources. Consequently, the County reserves the right to
discipline any employee who intentionally makes a false report of sexual
harassment.
§ 1.9 HARASSMENT (OF A NON-SEXUAL NATURE)
   (A)   Lake County encourages all of its employees to work in creating a
workplace that is harmonious and conducive to providing services to the public
and to fellow employees. Comments or actions that are deliberately hurtful,
rude, unprofessional, or offend other employees have no business in the
workplace.
   (B)   An employee should advise his/her supervisor or department head in
regard to activity brought about by another employee that undermines workplace
professionalism.
§ 1.10 OPEN DOOR POLICY
   (A)   The County is committed to making its business a good place for all
employees to work. This goal is achieved by developing and maintaining a
cooperative working relationship among employees based on mutual respect and
understanding. Employee opinions, thoughts, and feelings are important, and the
County recognizes the need for procedures that will allow employees to bring
questions, suggestions and concerns to its attention. At the same time, it is
important to recognize and follow the chain of command since many problems or
concerns can be best addressed by those closest to the problem.
   (B)   Employees should feel comfortable in discussing any questions,
comments or matters of concern with his/her supervisor or department head,
taking into account the following suggested steps:
      (1)   Employees should organize their thoughts on the issue;
      (2)   Adhere to the chain of command by first contacting one's immediate
supervisor;
      (3)   If the issue cannot be resolved with the supervisor, the employee
should schedule a meeting with the next person in the chain of command. If all
other levels of the chain of command have been exhausted, the employee may wish
to discuss the matter with the elected official over that individual's
department.
   (C)   In order to assist employees in following these guidelines, each
department and division should establish and inform its employees of the chain
of command (for that department/division).
   (D)   While the County may not be able to fully address every issue, every
effort will be made to assist employees and take their opinions into
consideration.
§ 1.11 INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS AND AGENTS
   (A)   The County will indemnify and defend its employees, officers and
agents at no cost to those individuals against legal action or a judgment taken
against them, while carrying out their official or individual duties providing
that the actions taken were within the scope of, and arising out of the
performance of that individual's official duties and responsibilities.
   (B)   Determination of whether the actions taken were within the scope of,
and arising out of the performance of official duties and responsibilities
shall be determined by an investigation conducted by the Board of
Commissioners' Attorney.
   (C)   Limitations - Indemnification shall include any judgment in a court of
law that arises out of a civil action made against an employee, officer or
agent. Indemnification shall not extend to:
      (1)   Acts of malice, intentional, willful, wanton, or criminal acts;
acts calculated or intended to accrue personal benefit which are beyond the
scope of the duties or authority of the employee, officer or agent unless
exonerated by a court.
      (2)   In the absence of a judicial determination, a determination may be
made by the Commissioners' Attorney in writing may determine whether the act is
indemnified. That finding shall be final unless rejected or modified by the
Board of Commissioners. A finding shall be final unless rejected or modified by
the Board of Commissioners. A copy of the determination shall be provided to
the employee, officer or agent within 10 (ten) business days of the
determination.
SECTION 2- HIRING PROCESS AND EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS
§ 2.1 APPLICATION. RECRUITMENT AND HIRING
   (A)   Lake County maintains a recruitment and hiring process designed to
allow all persons qualified and interested, an opportunity to apply.
Applications for most County positions can be obtained from the individual
division of government or department. Due to special requirements of the hiring
process, applications for the Lake County Police Department, Auditor,
Treasurer, Coroner, Recorder, Assessor, Surveyor, Clerk and Sheriff can be
obtained from those offices. In accordance with Indiana state statute,
applicants must also complete a Verification of Applicant for Employment for
Compliance with Lake County's Nepotism Policy form.
   (B)   Internal Recruitment Procedure
      (1)   The County values its employees and encourages promotion and
advancement from within and provides its employees an opportunity to apply for
a vacancy before that opportunity is extended to the general public.
      (2)   Open positions will be posted for a period of five (5) working days
internally unless otherwise noted by collective bargaining agreement, and a
reasonable attempt will be made to post the vacancy in all departments in the
County, easily accessible to department employees as well as in a common and
designated area in each County-owned facility. As a general rule, internal
bidders will file a job bid with the department with the open position and
should be considered and/or rejected before outside applications may be
considered. Temporary or seasonal employees may bid on any posted position,
providing if that employee was actively employed during at least one day of the
posting period. Employees who are completing a probationary period are not
eligible to bid on a posted vacancy. Generally, after posting the form
internally, and if the position has not been filled, the vacancy will then be
posted for three (3) days minimum for external candidates.
      (3)   The decision to award the open position to an internal candidate is
up to the department head and/or elected official that oversees that division
of county government. Consequently, an internal candidate is not entitled to
selection, and the elected official or department head may choose to seek
outside candidates instead.
   (C)   Exceptions to the Posting Procedure
      (1)   Supervisory positions (those positions where an employee oversees
other employees, processes or can authorize expenditures) may be filled by
using either internal or external recruitment procedures.
      (2)   Positions that are being filled due to transfer or voluntary
demotion may be waived at the discretion of the elected official who oversees
that division of county government.
      (3)   Due to the short term nature of temporary or seasonal positions,
the need to post these vacancies may be waived at the discretion of a
department and after discussion between the department head and the elected
official who governs that operation.
      (4)   Periodically, a position may be filled only to have the new
employee leave the position, either voluntarily or involuntarily, within the
first few weeks of employment. In the event that a vacancy occurs within thirty
(30) days of filling a position, the vacancy does not need to be reposted
unless the department head believes that it is in the best interest of the
County to do so.
   (D)   Recruitment Procedure - External
      (1)   When the internal recruiting procedure has failed to attract
qualified personnel for a valid job vacancy, candidates from outside current
County employment will be sought from any or all of the following sources:
         (a)   Minority recruitment resources as specified in the County's
affirmative action plan
         (b)   Walk in applicants
         (c)   Bulletin boards
         (d)   Newspaper advertising
         (e)   Professional journals
         (f)   Temporary employment agency
         (g)   State employment service
         (h)   Job bank applicants
      (2)   Positions will be held open for three (3) working days following
public notice. All employment notices and/or ads shall prominently display the
words “An Equal Opportunity Employer.”
   (E)   Hiring
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the department to contact individuals
for interviews and testing, using appropriate unbiased questions and validated
skills testing where relevant. In all positions requiring licenses or degrees,
all offers will be contingent upon receipt of copies of licenses or transcripts
of college work.
      (2)   Applicants will not be barred from consideration due to a
misdemeanor criminal conviction unless the position has access to sensitive
information or has responsibilities that may create conflict with that
applicant's record. Applicants may be required to apply for a limited criminal
background check depending on the position, and are responsible for the cost of
that background check.
      (3)   Final selection of the applicant will be made by the elected
official who oversees that department.
   (F)   Employment Processing and Paperwork
      (1)   Once a conditional offer of employment is made, whether it is for
part-time, full-time, seasonal or temporary employment, the applicant,
depending on departmental policy may be required to undergo a drug test.
Further employment processing will depend on the test results. The cost of the
testing shall be the responsibility of the applicant. If the applicant is hired
for employment, all future drug/alcohol testing that occurs due to employment
will be paid for by the County. A list of providers who may offer a discounted
drug test will be provided by “Working Well” at St. Anthony Medical Center in
Crown Point.
      (2)   Upon acceptance of the offer of employment (and results of a drug
test if applicable), a new employee will be provided basic employment
information such as days of work and first payday.
      (3)   The employment processing will also include the new hire's
completion of various forms and paperwork required by the County, State or
Federal Government:
         (a)   Submission of degrees, licenses, certifications or other proof
of position requirements;
         (b)   Completion of an I-9 immigration form, W-4 form, any relevant
deduction authorizations, personnel information file and employee
identification card;
         (c)   Referral and completion of a physical examination if required;
      (4)   The employee will also receive relevant information on insurance/
benefits, along with information regarding union status of the position being
filled (If it is a union position).
      (5)   Every new employee is asked to sign a copy of the disclaimer found
in the Introduction of this handbook that outlines and defines the “at-will”
relationship between that employee and the County.
§ 2.2 BRIDGING OF SERVICE - CREDIT FOR FULL-TIME STATUS
From time to time, an employee may leave the County's employment only to return
at a later date. Employees who return to work for the County and subsequently
complete twelve (12) months of consecutive employment will then be credited for
any previous full time employment service. Credited time will be applied
towards vacation and other benefits. This policy does not apply to employment
situations that pre-date the issuance of this handbook.
§ 2.3 CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
   (A)   When employees are hired, they provide information needed for payroll,
insurance, and pension purposes, to name a few. However, some of this
information periodically changes, and to make sure that the County's records
are up-to-date, all employees are required to report changes in personal
information including:
      (1)   Emergency Contact Information
      (2)   Home Address or Telephone Number
      (3)   Marital Status (marriage, divorce, legal separation)
      (4)   Beneficiary (for group term life insurance and/or pension plan
(PERF)
      (5)   Changes in Education
      (6)   Birth or Adoption of Child or Placement in Home of Foster Child
      (7)   A child's nineteenth birthday (for employees with dependent
children on the County's health and dental insurance plan). If the child is
enrolled in college, he/she may continue coverage (see the Insurance Department
for details).
   (B)   Although not required, employees are encouraged to provide their
supervisor with their e-mail address.
   (C)   An employee who is in a position that requires an on-call status may
be required to provide his/her supervisor with a current cellular telephone
number.
§ 2.4 DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS
   (A)   The County uses a variety of classifications to describe the status of
its employees to define the terms and conditions of employment. These terms can
be used by themselves, in conjunction with each other, or even interchangeably.
The terms clarify as to whether an employee is entitled to overtime or
benefits.
   (B)   Full- Time: An employee who has completed his/her orientation period
and who works on average at least thirty (30) hours or more per week.
   (C)   Full-Time Probationary: A newly hired employee or an employee assigned
(either through promotion or demotion) to a new job classification who has
worked at the same position for more than ninety (90) calendar days, then
becomes a full time employee. During the 90 day probationary period, a newly
hired employee is not eligible for health insurance benefits.
   (D)   During this period, the newly hired employee will have the opportunity
to get to know the County and the County will have the opportunity to get to
know the employee. The period allows an employee to become familiar with the
opportunities and responsibilities of being an employee of Lake County. This
period also allows both the employee and the County to determine whether
continued employment will be to the advantage of both parties. At the end of
this orientation period, the employee will become eligible for regular employee
status. The employee's department head will meet with the employee to discuss
his/her evaluation and status for permanent employment.
   (E)   In certain circumstances, it may be in the employee and County's best
interest to extend the orientation period for an additional thirty days.
However, regardless of an extension (of probation), the employee will be
eligible for health insurance benefits after he/she completes 90 calendar days
of employment.
   (F)   A full-time employee may be exempt or non-exempt:
      (1)   Exempt
         (a)   A full-time “exempt” employee is a salaried employee who is
exempt from the overtime and/or compensatory time requirements of the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA). An exempt employee has certain decision-making
responsibilities and meets other criteria of the federal act. Job titles alone
do not determine the exempt or non- exempt status of any employee.
         (b)   Since duties and responsibilities vary, it is best to verify
through the Humane Resources Department that a position meets the requirements
of being exempt under the FLSA. For example, an exempt employee must be paid on
a salary basis of no less than $455 per week and perform certain types of work
that is directly related to the overall management of a business or operation.
The person must be authorized to directly or indirectly hire, fire and direct
at least two other employees. The employee's primary duty must include the
exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance within the operation. Additional exemptions may be granted if the
position:
            1.   requires specialized academic training for entry into a
professional field, or
            2.   is in the computer field (employees who work in the computer
field may be exempt if they are paid no less than $27.63 per hour), or
            3.   is in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.
      (2)   Non Exempt - A full-time employee who is “non-exempt” is entitled
to overtime and/or compensatory time under the Fair Labor Standards Act for all
hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek, at a rate of 1.5
times the hours worked either in pay or compensatory time. (See Flexible
Schedule Section for additional details.)
   (G)   Part-Time
      (1)   An employee who has completed his/her orientation period and who
works on average less than twenty-nine (29) hours per week. Part- time
employees, although valuable members of the County’s workforce, are not
eligible for all of the benefits (such as health insurance or pension benefits)
afforded to full time employees.
      (2)   A part-time employee is prohibited from working for more than one
County officeholder or department during a single pay period and shall not work
more than twenty-nine (29) hours per week in a single pay period.
      (3)   Since part-time employees are limited to 29 hours per week, they
should not work more than forty (40) hours in a week. However, in the event
that a part-time employee does work more than forty hours in a week, the
employee will be paid at a rate of l .5 times the number of hours worked (over
and above forty hours) either in pay or compensatory time in accordance with
federal law.
   (H)   Temporary or Seasonal: An employee who is hired for a specific period
of time, with a known duration of no more than four (4) months or an employee
who is assigned to a part-time job with a known limited duration of less than
ten (10) full months is not eligible for benefits. Often these employees are
also referred to as seasonal or temporary employees. A temporary employee may
work either a full or part-time schedule depending upon the assignment. If the
employee works more than forty hours in a week, the employee will be paid at a
rate of 1.5 times the number of hours worked (over and above forty hours)
either in pay or compensatory time.
   (I)   Classification Regarding Exempt Employees
      (1)   As noted above, certain positions such as department heads are
considered exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The position must
meet certain standards and conditions, and be given authority and
responsibility that makes the position exempt under the FLSA.
      (2)   By virtue of this designation, exempt employees do not track the
hours that they work. For timesheet purposes, exempt employees are instructed
to note which days they worked and that they “have completed all assigned tasks
and duties.”
      (3)   Employees who have specific questions regarding their exempt or
non-exempt status should review the Fair Labor Standards Act or contact the
County Council's Attorney or U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division.
(Ord. 1356C-3, passed 7-7-2015)
§ 2.5 ORIENTATION
   (A)   A new employee needs to become familiar with his/her position, County
operations, policies, rules and regulations and fringe benefits. In order to
provide new employees with support, answers to questions and assistance in
being successful in their daily job duties, the County conducts a two-step
orientation process for its employees.
   (B)   The first step in the orientation process is provided by the County
Human Resource Office, which will review basic employment requirements and
benefits, such as:
      (1)   Job title and wages
      (2)   Fringe benefits
      (3)   Rules and regulations, including disciplinary procedures
      (4)   Requirements of the collective bargaining agreement, if such an
agreement covers the new employee
      (5)   Review of this handbook
   (C)   After meeting with the Human Resources Office, the employee will
complete the orientation process with his/her department head who will review
specific job duties, explain the work site, job duties required, performance
expectations, department rules and safety regulations. Many larger departments
will assign a new employee to shadow or be mentored by a senior employee who
knows the position and responsibilities.
§ 2.6 PROBATIONARY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
   (A)   Every new employee, as well as an employee who transfers from one
position to another, begins his/her employment with the County as a
probationary employee (with the exception of certain executive level employees
such as department heads) for the first ninety (90) calendar days of
employment. Probation is an assessment period that helps determine whether the
employee and County should continue the employment on a more long-term basis. A
probationary employee may be dismissed or may voluntarily quit for any reason
(s) and shall not have any recourse through the County's grievance procedure.
An employee who is completing a probationary period may not bid or apply for
another open position.
   (B)   A performance evaluation should conclude the probationary process and
allow the department head to communicate to the employee any area(s) of
satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or areas where the employee should improve his/
her performance. The report is confidential and should only be discussed with
the employee.
§ 2.7 WORK HOURS
   (A)   This policy applies to all County employees including those covered by
a collective bargaining agreement, unless the bargaining agreement or contract
explicitly addresses the issue in a manner contrary to this chapter. In those
instances, the terms of the bargaining agreement or contract will supersede the
terms of this chapter.
   (B)   County offices are open to the public Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m., excluding holidays. Some departments have adopted a different
schedule due to the nature of the position or a flexible work schedule to
better accommodate the public. An employee's supervisor will assign a specific
work schedule. Please note that a work schedule is not guaranteed and is
subject to change.
   (C)   Regular Work Time - The regular work week shall be considered Monday
through Friday and the regular workday is defined as eight hours per day from
8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (unless as noted above).
   (D)   Lunch Hour
      (1)   Salaried employees are entitled to a one-hour lunch period per
workday. Employees who fail to take a lunch period will not be compensated
unless authorized by the department head to work through a lunch hour in order
to allow that employee to adjust his/her start or end time (come in late or
leave early on the same day), or due to circumstances where the employee was
required to perform his/her work duties that precluded the employee from taking
a lunch.
      (2)   Hourly employees are entitled to lunchtime set by department
policy.
   (E)   Breaks - The County provides breaks or rest periods to its employees.
Non-exempt employees who work at least seven hours in one shift will receive a
break of 15 minutes at approximately the middle of every three and one half
hours of work not interrupted by a meal period. Supervisors are responsible for
scheduling the time for employee breaks. All breaks should be arranged so that
they do not disrupt County business or service to the public and should
consider the workload and the nature of the job or jobs being performed. When
necessary, the frequency and time of breaks may be changed. Time spent on
breaks is compensated as working time. Employees are expected to be punctual in
starting and ending their breaks and are subject to disciplinary action for
extending breaks beyond the 15 minutes allowed.
   (F)   Overtime/Compensatory Time
      (1)   Eligibility for compensable overtime will be determined by the Fair
Labor Standards Act. All overtime must be approved and authorized by an
employee's department head or supervisor. Under no circumstances may an
employee authorize his/her own overtime.
      (2)   All non exempt employees will be granted compensatory or overtime
at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) hours for all hours worked over (40)
hours in any given work week. (Note: Although some full-time employees work
only 35 hours, federal law requires that overtime [or compensatory time] be
paid at 1-1/2 times that employee's normal rate of pay only when the hours
worked in a week exceeds 40 hours.)
      (3)   Should compensatory time be awarded, an employee cannot accumulate
more than 480 hours of compensatory time in one year if the employee works in a
public safety activity, an emergency response activity or a seasonal activity.
All other employees are limited to no more than 240 hours compensatory time per
year. Employees who exceed these limits must be paid overtime. An accurate
record of all compensatory time earned and used shall be maintained by the
department bookkeeper (See “Record Keeping” this section). An employee's
request for the use of compensatory time off shall be made at least three (3)
working days prior to the date(s) requested off. The request shall be honored
unless the use would unduly disrupt the operations of the department by
imposing an unreasonable burden on the department's ability to provide services
of acceptable quality and quantity for the public during the time requested
without the use of the employee's services.
      (4)   All compensatory time must be taken within the year it was earned
unless the time is accumulated in the last quarter of the calendar year. Time
earned during the last quarter only may be carried over to the first quarter of
the following year. The carried-over compensatory time must be taken within
that first quarter. Unused compensatory time must be paid as overtime.
   (G)   Record Keeping
      (1)   Documented overtime and compensatory time records shall be kept by
each department for all employees and shall include:
         (a)   Date and reason for accumulation
         (b)   Name of person authorizing the overtime
         (c)   Date compensatory time taken
         (d)   All other records required by the FLSA or other federal or state
law or regulation
      (2)   Time sheets shall reflect compensatory time taken and shall not be
reflected as hours worked on that date.
      (3)   The Attorney of Record for each division of County government has
the final authority interpreting this policy and is responsible for ensuring
that all required records are kept and in accordance with the FLSA and will
take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with state and federal
regulation.
   (H)   Special Exceptions - Special exceptions to the regular workday and
work week may exist where employees may be required to work other hours or days
to meet the particular requirements of County services. In addition, regular
hours are subject to change with the authorization of the employee's department
head.
   (I)   Time Sheet Requirement - It shall be the responsibility of the
department head to ensure that an accurate daily attendance record is kept on
every employee in the department.
   (J)   Falsification of Time Records - Any individual who is involved in the
falsification of time records or who knowingly causes improper reporting may be
subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
§ 2.8 FLEXIBLE TIME
   (A)   In certain situations it may be possible for an employee, with the
permission of his/her department head and Elected Official, to work an adjusted
or flexible work schedule. The schedule must not cause a reduction in the
ability of that employee's department to properly perform its duties and
responsibilities. Further, the establishment of a flexible schedule may not
result in the need to hire other employees or the use of overtime to cover
those “traditional” hours not worked by the employee working a flexible
schedule.
   (B)   The employee is still eligible to overtime pay for all hours worked in
excess of forty (40) hours in one week. (See Vacation Section for additional
details.)
§ 2.9 EMERGENCY CLOSINGS
   (A)   Under certain circumstances it may be necessary to close one or more
County facilities due to natural hazards or catastrophes. If a facility is
closed, employees will be notified via telephone, if possible. In the case of
severe weather, employees should listen to local radio stations for information
regarding closings and when the County will be open for business. Employees
should also contact their Department Head to find out if their department is
open.
   (B)   When a facility is closed, and an employee was scheduled to work that
day, the employee is excused from work and will be paid their regular rate of
pay for that day if he/she were scheduled to work. In the event that the
employee is required to report for work during an emergency closing (such as
maintenance or to secure records, etc.), the employee is not entitled to
additional compensation.
§ 2.10 PAY PERIODS, PAYDAYS, PAYCHECKS, PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS, AND CREDIT UNION
   (A)   Pay Periods - Employees are paid every two weeks on Monday. The first
day of the pay period is Monday and ends 14 days later on Sunday. Time sheets
are used to determine the amount an employee is paid each pay period and serve
as the official record of an employee's service to the County.
   (B)   Paydays - Paydays occur on Monday. No other person is allowed to
“pick-up” an employee's paycheck without the employee's permission in writing.
   (C)   Payroll Deductions - There are two types of payroll deductions, those
mandated by the government and those that employees choose to make.
   (D)   Mandated Payroll Deductions - Certain deductions are made from
employees' paychecks as mandated by the state and/or federal government or
court. These deductions include:
      (1)   Federal Income Taxes (as indicated by an employee on the W-
4 federal income tax withholding form)
      (2)   State Income Taxes (as indicated by an employee on the state income
tax withholding form)
      (3)   PERF Contributions
      (4)   Social Security (FICA) and Medicare (MCARE)
      (5)   Court ordered child support and garnishments
   (E)   Voluntary Payroll Deductions
      (1)   Employees may choose to have any or all of the following that apply
to them deducted from their paychecks:
         (a)   Health insurance contributions
         (b)   457 Supplemental retirement contributions
         (c)   Supplemental insurance plan contributions
         (d)   Credit Union
         (e)   U.S. Savings Bonds
         (f)   Political contributions
         (g)   Pre paid legal assistance
         (h)   United Way Contributions
      (2)   Employees may elect to have voluntary deductions taken from their
pay only if they authorize deductions in writing.
   (F)   Direct Deposit of Paychecks - Employees may elect to have their
paychecks directly deposited with most banks, credit unions and financial
institutions.
   (G)   Paycheck Errors, Lost Paycheck, or Stolen Paychecks - Employees who
discover a mistake in their paycheck, lose their paycheck, or have it stolen
must notify their payroll clerk immediately. In the case of a mistake, the
error will be remedied as quickly as possible. In the event of a lost or stolen
paycheck, the employee may have to wait up to sixty (60) days before the check
is reissued.
§ 2.11 PERSONNEL ACTIONS
   (A)   This policy applies to all County employees including those covered by
a collective bargaining agreement, unless the bargaining agreement or contract
explicitly addresses the issue in a manner contrary to this chapter. In those
instances, the terms of the bargaining agreement or contract will supersede the
terms of this chapter.
   (B)   It is the policy of the County to set up orderly policies and
practices to ensure consistency in normal changes to employee status. Changes
in employment status may result from any one (1) of the following:
      (1)   Temporary Transfers - A temporary transfer is one that is needed to
accommodate extended leave situations, temporary vacancies or any other
situation involving an overload or crisis.
      (2)   Lateral Transfer - A transfer of personnel between departments for
individuals meeting the job qualifications. Request for transfer must be made
in writing and approved by the elected official overseeing that division or
department.
      (3)   Promotions
         (a)   Job openings shall be posted in each department in a location
accessible to all employees and in designated areas. Existing employees may be
considered first.
         (b)   A number of factors may be considered in evaluating an employee
for possible promotion including:
            1.   Ability to meet job qualifications
            2.   Previous employment evaluations
            3.   Educational qualifications
            4.   Experience
            5.   Prior attendance records.
         (c)   Current employees requesting a promotion to a vacancy must apply
with the department with the vacancy and fill out the necessary paperwork.
         (d)   Any promotion shall be considered probationary for a period not
to exceed ninety (90) days. The performance shall then be evaluated at that
point and a final decision made. During the probationary period, the employee
may not apply for any other open position.
         (e)   Although the County is committed to promoting its existing
workforce, it reserves the right to hire outside personnel rather than promote
from within a department for supervisory positions.
      (4)   Demotions
         (a)   An employee may request to be placed in a lower job
classification for whatever reason provided the position is vacant and the
employee is qualified for the position. Demotions may also occur due to
reorganization.
         (b)   Demotions may also occur due to disciplinary issues and as an
alternative to termination, providing the employee is able to perform the
duties of the new position. Demotions for inadequate performance will be
permitted as follows:
            1.   Demotions must be made upon documented evidence that the
employee has received prior warning and assistance to attempt to overcome
inadequacies and has not been successful.
            2.   The employee's previous position is not vacant.
            3.   If there is not a vacancy, the employee will be placed on a
temporary leave of absence without pay until a position opens for which the
employee is qualified.
         (c)   In the event that an employee is promoted or demoted, any
balance of unused vacation, sick or personal days is transferred with the
employee to his/her new position. The value of the transferred leave days shall
be paid at the employee's new rate of pay. All remaining compensatory time must
be used or it will be paid at the employee's old rate of pay.
      (5)   Reduction in Force
         (a)   Like all employers, certain conditions may arise where the
County may find it necessary to reduce employment. A reduction in force or
layoff may occur for one of the following conditions:
            1.   Lack of work,
            2.   Budgetary restraints
            3.   Reorganization which eliminates a position(s)
         (b)   In regard to recall rights, this policy does not apply to
policy-making positions, part-time positions, temporary positions or
probationary employees. The County will not layoff full time employees and
replace those positions with part time employees. Layoffs may occur in any
other order at the discretion of management. However, if all other
qualifications are equal, seniority will be used as a determining factor.
         (c)   Employees who are subject to layoff will be given as much notice
as possible of the reduction in force and at least two (2) weeks of notice in
writing if the layoff is for more than five (5) working days. Laid-off
employees are entitled to priority in recall if the old position becomes
available during the six (6) month period following layoff or another position
that the laid off employee is qualified for. Departments may extend this period
beyond six months. Those laid-off last will be recalled first if qualified. In
the event that two or more qualified employees were laid off on the same date
the recall will be governed by seniority.
         (d)   Benefits available during lay-off
            1.   Vacation and sick time will remain intact for the first 30
days unless used. The employee will not accrue additional time during layoff.
            2.   No pension benefits will accrue.
            3.   Reimbursement for all unused compensatory time.
            4.   After 30 days an employee on layoff, the employee may continue
health insurance benefits but will be solely responsible for payment of the
premium (See COBRA Section for more details).
      (6)   Terminations
         (a)   All terminations must be documented in writing to the employee,
the employee's personnel file, and the elected official over that division of
government. All terminations for cause must be approved by the elected
official. Terminated employees are entitled to payment for vacation time
accrued but not taken during the year of separation. Terminated employees will
not be paid for unused personal days or sick days but will be reimbursed for
all unused compensatory time.
         (b)   An employee may be discharged for cause for any of the
following, including but not limited to:
            1.   Unsatisfactory work performance
            2.   Failure to satisfy the conditions of employment
            3.   Conduct unbecoming a County employee
            4.   Malfeasance, including criminal conduct or conflict of
interest
            5.   Insubordination
            6.   Violations of departmental rules and regulations
         (c)   Indiana is an “at-will” state and as such the County reserves
the right to dismiss employees with or without cause as the need arises. Please
see “Guidelines for Conduct” in the Employee Responsibilities section of this
handbook for additional information.
      (7)   Resignation - If an employee chooses to voluntarily resign his/her
position with the County, the separation is final and the employee is entitled
to be paid for any vacation time, personal time and sick time accrued but not
taken during the year of separation.
      (8)   Retirement - If an employee chooses to retire, he/she must advise
the department head in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the chosen
date. The employee is entitled to payment for any vacation time, personal time
and sick time accrued but not taken during the year of separation.
      (9)   General Rules Applying to Termination, Resignation, and Retirement
         (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the department head to
complete the following upon termination (voluntary or involuntary) of an
employee:
            1.   Retrieve all keys, tools, and any other County property the
employee may have in his possession.
            2.   Retrieve employee I.D.
            3.   Complete a change of status form which can be obtained from
Data Processing.
         (b)   All forms must be completed within seven (7) days of the
termination.
         (c)   No severance pay of any type shall be paid to any employee of
the County upon separation of employment.
      (10)   Exit Interviews
         (a)   When an employee leaves County employment voluntarily, an exit
interview should be held by the department head to clarify and discuss the
following:
            1.   Separation payments including discussion of payment of
vacation or personal time (if applicable).
            2.   Status of benefits after termination.
            3.   Answer any other questions the employee may have at
separation.
         (b)   A standard exit interview form may be obtained from Human
Resources.
      (11)   Employee Death
         (a)   In the event that an active employee passes away, that
employee's survivors are entitled to:
            1.   Payment of any unpaid work hours, overtime or compensatory
time.
            2.   Payment of any unused vacation, sick and personal days.
            3.   Life insurance benefits if applicable.
            4.   Workmen's compensation benefits if the death results from a
work-related accident.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the Insurance Department to
assist the employee's survivors in obtaining payments and insurance benefits.
§ 2.12 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
   (A)   Performance evaluations are an important part of the employer-employee
relationship. Evaluations provide a formal method of communication between an
employee and his/her supervisor. All employees shall be evaluated on a regular
basis by the department head or his/her designee. At a minimum, evaluations
shall occur:
      (1)   At least one (1) week prior to the completion of the probationary
period.
      (2)   At least annually.
      (3)   Whenever any change in employment status is initiated.
   (B)   The Human Resources Office shall provide the evaluation form to be
used and the department head has the discretion to include any other
evaluations which may be unique to the position. All completed evaluation forms
shall be signed by the employee. Should the employee choose not to sign the
evaluation, the evaluator shall mark “Refused” on the signature line, and
initial that entry. A copy of all completed forms shall become part of the
employee's permanent file (kept within the employee's department).
   (C)   Temporary Reassignment - In certain circumstances, an employee may be
temporarily or seasonally reassigned to another department. Whenever such a
reassignment occurs, that employee will be evaluated by the new supervisor. If
the reassignment is less than one year, both the temporary and permanent
supervisor will evaluate the employee.
§ 2.13 OFFICIAL PERSONNEL RECORDS AND INFORMATION
   (A)   An employee's official personnel file is maintained by the department
bookkeeper who has been entrusted with maintaining those files with strict
confidentiality. Notes, letters, the employee's official evaluations and other
matters that require documentation shall be provided to the bookkeeper for
placement in the file. To assure that personnel files are maintained in
accordance with state and federal regulation, it will be the decision of the
department head as to whether a document is eligible for inclusion in a
personnel file.
   (B)   The County will take every possible step to safeguard the
confidentiality of an employee's personnel file. It is available for review/
access by others only under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Ordered by a court;
      (2)   Requested by a department head or supervisor for review for a
transfer, promotion, disciplinary or other personnel action;
      (3)   Required by state or federal law;
      (4)   Needed to be reviewed to answer a complaint of discrimination filed
by the employee with the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, the E.E.O.C. or for
compliance with any state or federal regulatory agency.
      (5)   The following information can be released to the general public
including the news media as required by Indiana statute (IC 5-14-3-4):
         (a)   The name, compensation, job title, business address, business
telephone number, job description, education and training background, previous
work experience or date of first and last employment of present or former
employment;
         (b)   Information relating to the status of any formal charges against
the employee; and
         (c)   Information concerning disciplinary actions in which final
action has been taken and that resulted in the employee being disciplined or
discharged.
   (C)   As required by federal and state law, medical records, worker
compensation files, sexual harassment complaints and requests for Family and
Medical Leave, shall not be co-mingled with the employee's regular personnel
file. Instead a separate file will be maintained for those issues.
   (D)   Employees may periodically review their personnel file during regular
business hours. The employee may be asked to sign a log recording when the file
was accessed. Employees should alert the department's bookkeeper to perceived
discrepancies and work to resolve the matter. Should those efforts fail, the
employee may file a grievance to correct any alleged discrepancies.
§ 2.14 REFERENCES/EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
   (A)   Requests for references should be referred to the elected official or
the department head for the division for which the employee worked. The County
does not release detailed information regarding past performance; rather, it
provides only basic information regarding employment such as dates worked and
confirmation of position and pay. In those cases where an employee has been
discharged due to an objectionable action, such inquiries will be referred to
the attorney of record for that division of government.
   (B)   Requests for employment verification (such as start date and current
pay rate) should be provided in writing (including by facsimile) to the payroll
clerk for the division of government for which the employee worked.
§ 2.15 TRAVEL GUIDELINES
   (A)   Out-of-Town Travel For Professional Development or Conference
Attendance
      (1)   Authorized County Travel Generally A County Employee shall only be
authorized to engage in County-related business travel in accordance with
Sections (2) through (5) as noted below. “County Employee” shall exclude County
Elected Officials (“County Official”). Hereinafter, “Travel” shall mean County-
Related Business Travel. Further, “travel status” shall mean a County employee
engaged in County related business as defined below.
      (2)   Authorized Travel by a County Employee
         (a)   The Employee's Travel must be approved in advance and in writing
by the County Official the employee reports to, if the travel is outside the
County and if the travel:
            1.   Is in excess of one hundred seventy-five miles one way from
the person's home or station;
            2.   Is travel where the lodging selected by the employee includes
or offers resort accommodations (i.e., golf, spa, gambling);
            3.   Involves three (3) or more people from the same Department to
the same location and includes an overnight stay; or
            4.   Is estimated to cost in excess of One Thousand Two Hundred
Fifty ($1,250.00) Dollars for total trip per person.
         (b)   Travel not covered under Section (2)(a), shall be approved by
the County official the employee reports to. Travel of a routine nature
necessary for employees to fulfill their normal responsibilities may be
authorized by policy set by each unit of government (and approved by the
respective County elected official). The written policy shall describe in
sufficient detail the travel being approved.
         (c)   At the discretion of the County official, additional approvals
may be requested.
      (3)   County Travel Form An “Authorization for Travel” shall be used to
document the approval of the travel taken under paragraph (2)(a). When required
by Section (2) above, County employees shall attach to their expense
reimbursement requests a properly executed “Authorization for Travel” form. It
shall be the duty of the employee's county official and subsequently the County
Commissioner's Office to verify the County form “Authorization for Travel” is
attached to the employee's expense reimbursement requests.
      (4)   Criteria for Approval of Travel
         (a)   Travel is designed to reimburse the expenses of an employee on
County business and allowing up to one (1) day of travel time the day before
and one (1) day of travel time the day after the meeting, depending on the
actual circumstances as approved by the County official.
         (b)   Travel status should not start prior to, or end after, the
normally required periods of time necessary to complete the official County
business.
         (c)   The primary purpose for travel must be County business, but
occasionally a person may be approved to take a trip that includes both
personal (vacation leave or time off) time and business travel. The County form
“Authorization for Travel” must indicate the complete period of time the person
will be approved if it encompasses personal leave both before and after the
official County business. A County employee shall exercise special care not to
seek reimbursement for expenses that could be construed to be personal. If
personal time is combined with any trip, the lodging and subsistence for the
extra days of travel time are not eligible for reimbursement.
         (d)   County employees traveling to locations within four (4) hours
drive time are generally expected to travel by automobile.
         (e)   Normally “side-trips” are not allowed in conjunction with County
travel. A “side-trip” is defined as when a County employee needs to travel from
City “A” to City “B” for county business and the County employees travel to
City “C” either before or after going to city “B”. However, if the “side-trip”
is previously, the costs associated with the “side-trip” shall not be
reimbursed. If travel is by air, the allowable reimbursement would be lower of
the commercial carrier fare one-way between cities “A” and “B” times two (2) or
the round-trip fare between cities “A” and “B” determined based on the same
data and time the County employees departed City “A”. Such reimbursable air
fare shall be established and documented on the County form “Authorization for
Travel” prior to approval of the form. If driving a personal vehicle, the
County employee shall be reimbursed the round-trip map mileage between cities
“A” and “B”. If driving a county-owned lease vehicle, the County employee shall
declare the mileage in excess of the round-trip mileage as personal mileage.
Additional time spent by the employee in traveling to City “C” shall be
considered personal leave.
      (5)   Travel Arrangements
         (a)   When two (2) or more County employees are traveling the same
general route using either a County-owned leased vehicle or private owned
vehicle only one (1) vehicle shall be driven if it is administratively
feasible.
         (b)   Prior to submitting the County form “Authorization for Travel”,
the authorized County Travel Agency shall be contacted regarding reservations
for lodging accommodations and airfare, or other travel arrangements.
   (B)   Reimbursement for County Travel
      (1)   Reimbursement for County Travel The county shall only make payment
for, or reimburse for travel to or on behalf of a County employee who is
entitled to it and in compliance with the terms and provisions of this policy.

         (a)   The County shall not pay a travel expense where another person
or entity other than the authorized County employee pays the expense.
         (b)   If a travel expense has been approved in advance by the
appropriate County official, the actual travel expense incurred by the County
employee is payable only to the extent it is less than or equal to the approved
travel expense. This requirement may be waived by the County official if its
enforcement, under the circumstances, would be unfair, inequitable,
impractical, unreasonable, or otherwise not consistent with the policies and
principles underlying this policy.
      (4)   Conference Expenses A County employee may be reimbursed for the
cost of registration fees associated with attendance at conferences. Only the
County employee's portion of the registration fee, and not fees for any other
accompanying the County employee, shall be paid.
      (5)   Allowable Reimbursements - Legal Required
         (a)   A Department or County employee may not receive, accept, or
retain travel expense, lodging, transportation, meal, or any other good or
service with respect to travel that is provided by another person or entity who
is not legally obligated to do so unless such receipt, acceptance, or retention
is legal, ethical, and does not raise the appearance of impropriety. Any such
expense, allowance, good or service that has been improperly paid or accepted
shall forthwith be refunded or otherwise paid for by the County employee.
         (b)   Each person requesting reimbursement for travel expenses shall
submit a claim covering only the person's own expense. No reimbursement may be
made for the expenses of another person. However, a person may receive
reimbursement for the travel expenses of pupils, wards, patients, or offenders

Proof of conversion rate(s) at the time the expense was incurred must be
submitted for expenses paid in any other currency.

this policy and submit a copy of the procedures to the Lake County Board of
Commissioners and Lake County Council.
      (8)   Recovery of Expenses Erroneously Paid The County may recover any
expenses of allowance paid to any person or entity:
         (a)   Which was erroneously paid for any reason;
         (b)   When paid because of illegality or fraud on the part of any
person or entity; or
         (c)   Which was paid under the mistaken belief, at the time payment
was made, that such payment was in accordance with this policy.
      (9)   Preferred Travel Expense Method The County shall make payment when
travel is by the preferred traveling method. The preferred traveling method is
the least expensive or most effective means of travel which is also:
         (a)   Available at the time and place where it is needed;
         (b)   Necessary for the County travel involved;
         (c)   Appropriate, sufficient, and timely for the County travel
involved;
         (d)   Reasonably safe; and
         (e)   Reasonably comfortable.
      (10)   Preferred Transportation
         (a)   When the County travel is within the County or two hundred fifty

first by County owned/leased vehicle, and second by personal vehicle.
         (b)   When the County travel is greater than two hundred fifty (250)
miles from the County employee's station, the preferred traveling methods rank
as follows:
            1.   By commercial air;
            2.   By other commercial transportation;
            3.   By state owned/leased vehicle; or
            4.   By personal vehicle.
      (11)   Reimbursement for Vehicle Use
         (a)   If the travel of a County employee will be by vehicle, County
owned/leased vehicles shall be used when available and practical.
         (b)   A county employee in a personal vehicle will be paid allowance
for the lesser of the distance actually traveled of the distance between the
destination and the County employee's station, and as provided by Section (B)
(12).

         (c)   Additional mileage, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the
“Shortest Route” mileage may be claimed when the usually traveled route entails
the use of an interstate highway which is not the “Shortest Route”.
            1.   The ten percent (10%) additional mileage is a maximum
deviation and not as automatic additional charge.
            2.   In no case shall the allowable mileage exceed the actual map
mileage.

public transportation terminals see Section C.8.).
      (14)   Travel by Air
         (a)   The coach class of travel by commercial air carrier will be
reimbursed. “Super Saver” or other airfares carrying cancellation penalties
shall be used in extreme caution. The penalty fee may be reimbursed only if
legitimate County business prohibits the County employee from traveling.
         (b)   Occasionally, it may be cost effective for a County employee to
travel on a weekend to obtain a less expensive airline fare. Lodging and meals
for the weekend travel will be reimbursed to the employee if the net savings to
the County exceeds One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars.
         (c)   Departments are encouraged to make all out-of-state travel
arrangements through the County's Travel Agent to help reduce costs.
         (d)   The Board of Commissioners has the authority to adopt and
enforce specific policies for air travel. For example, County employees could
be required to travel to a particular airport or on a particular airline to
avail the County of a reduced group airfare.
      (15)   Non-Commercial Air Transportation Written approval from the Board
of Commissioners is required before making arrangements for non-commercial or
charter air transportation.
      (16)   Other Main Travel Modes The cost of travel by railroad or bus may
be reimbursed. To be reimbursed a County employee must submit acceptable

trips with the travel voucher stating the nature of the trips.
         (c)   The cost of parking at a terminal may be reimbursed at long-term
rates. A County employee may use a personal vehicle for transportation to a
terminal instead of using public transportation and may be reimbursed for the
cost of round-trip mileage between the station and the terminal.

for parking at the terminal is allowable; however reimbursement for a second
round-trip may not exceed the avoided long-term parking fees.
      (18)   Vehicle Rental
         (a)   Vehicle rental expense is reimbursable for Out-of-State travel
when it is efficient and cost effective and when approved in advance by the
County official. The least expensive practical vehicle shall be rented.
         (b)   The cost of renting a vehicle, in connection with travel by
other modes of transportation, may be reimbursed if suitable local public
transportation is not available or when rental is considered more advantageous
to the County than the use of public transportation due to routing or
scheduling considerations.
         (c)   The Department requesting the rental of a vehicle must submit a
written request to the County official justifying the need for the rental of a
vehicle prior to making arrangements for renting the vehicle. If the County
official approves the request, the County Travel Agent or County employee shall
make reservations for the most economical vehicle.
         (d)   Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), or Liability Damage Waiver (LDW),
insurance covering use of the vehicle is a reimbursable expense. The cost of
any other insurance will not be reimbursed and such costs must be deducted from
the claim for reimbursement.
         (e)   Initial payment of the cost of renting a vehicle is the
responsibility of the County employee. The County employee may be reimbursed
for:
            1.   The cost of renting the vehicle;
            2.   The cost of additional fuel;
            3.   The cost of Collision, or Liability Damage Waiver (CDW) or
(LDW) Insurance; and
            4.   Parking tolls.
         (f)   Each item of cost must be supported by receipts as required by
Section E.1. The claim for reimbursement must itemize the business usage of the
vehicle, showing point-to-point travel, the same as for a personal vehicle. The
County employee may be reimbursed for vehicle rental, excluding any personal
usage, according to the following formula:
Reimbursement = E x Ms
       Mt
Where:      Ms is the mileage traveled on County business
      Mt is the total mileage traveled; and
      E is the total expense for rental of the vehicle.
         (g)   It is the responsibility of the County employee to make sure
both the beginning and ending mileage are on the receipt.
   (C)   Lodging
      (1)   Preferred Lodging
         (a)   Lodging arrangements with respect to travel shall be made in

County official or the County's Travel Agent, if available.
      (2)   Reimbursement for Lodging A County employee in travel status may
claim reimbursement for actual lodging expenses not exceeding the single
occupancy room charge, including taxes, for overnight stays only. It is the
County employee's responsibility to check out the accommodations in sufficient
time to not be required to pay additional expenses for late checkout.
      (3)   Shared Accommodations
         (a)   If accommodations are shared by County employees:
            1.   The total room charge cannot be claimed by either traveler.
            2.   Each traveler shall request a hotel bill in the traveler's
name.
            3.   Each traveler shall claim a pro-rata share of the total room
charge as listed on the traveler's individual bill.
         (b)   If accommodations are shared by non-County employees:
            1.   A separate bill need not be issued if the expense of lodging
is being shared with another person:
               a.   The County employee can claim the total bill divided by the
number of occupants, if applicable, or
               b.   The County employee can claim the single occupancy rate.
      (4)   Lodging Provider-Limitation A County employee may not claim
reimbursement for lodging when the lodging was provided by another individual
who is not in the business of providing lodging.
      (5)   Lodging Rates-Limitation All individuals, including County
employees and County officials, are urged to stay in hotels/motels offering
reasonable government rates. These reduced rates usually must be requested of
the hotel/motel in advance. To receive reasonable government rates, lodging
establishments may require government identification. County employees who
prefer accommodations at unreasonable rates will not receive full
reimbursement. County employees should pay special heed to this policy when
selecting anything other than modest accommodations. Staying in the “conference
hotel/motel” is not necessarily required; conference hotels/motels should not
be utilized as lower cost accommodations are available and practical.
SECTION 3- EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES
§ 3.1 ATTENDANCE POLICY
   (A)   It is a basic expectation that all employees are expected to report
for work on a daily basis and in a punctual manner. Failure to do so will
result in disciplinary action.
   (B)   Tardiness - In order to preserve and maintain effective operations,
employees of the County should be present and ready to work by their assigned
starting time. Tardiness can be cause for appropriate disciplinary action when
an employee fails to show up on time. A supervisor should exercise discretion
to not discipline for tardiness if there is a justifiable emergency and no
pattern of chronic tardiness on the part of this employee; however, said
discretion must be exercised uniformly in similar situations.
   (C)   Excused Absences and Illness - An employee shall be considered off
with an excused absence provided the employee has received prior approval from
a supervisor. Each division or department shall set its own procedure for
calling off. If no departmental procedure is in place, then an employee who is
absent due to illness must report off prior to or within ten minutes of his/her
start time in order to be considered excused. Employees who call off later than
fifteen (15) minutes after their start time shall be considered off with an
unexcused emergency that impeded the employee's ability to make such contact.
   (D)   Absence Without Pay
      (1)   As an entity whose primary responsibility is to serve the public,
unnecessary or unauthorized absence can have a very detrimental impact on
operations. It is the general policy of the County not to allow employees to be
absent without pay, and such notation will not be accepted by the County's
payroll system (In certain circumstances, up to 10 (ten) days of unpaid absence
may be granted in the twelve (12) month period following an approved Family and
Medical Leave - See Family and Medical Leave in Section 4 for details).
      (2)   However, in certain circumstances, such as a work reduction or at
the end of the calendar year where an employee may have already exhausted all
of his or her paid leave, a non-paid absence may be granted with written
permission of that employee's elected official or department head. Such
permission must be granted in advance unless the situation is an emergency
situation. Under no circumstances may an employee incur more than 2 (two)
occurrences of unexcused absences in a calendar year or 1 (one) in a one month
period unless the absence is due to a work reduction. Violations of this policy
may be subject to disciplinary action.
   (E)   Unexcused Absences - An employee who fails to have authorization or
has failed to notify his/her supervisor that they will not be at work is
considered to have an unexcused absence and will not be paid. Three consecutive
days of unexcused absence shall be considered voluntary resignation and will
terminate the employee's position and accompanying benefits.
   (F)   Sick Days
      (1)   Sick days may only be used for the illness of the employee, care of
one's spouse or child (under the age of 18 or as defined by the Family and
Medical Leave Act). Certain conditions apply in regard to the use of sick days:
         (a)   Any employee who misses three (3) or more consecutive work days
shall be required to provide a doctor's excuse upon return to work (including
if that absence is due to the care of a spouse or child). Failure to do so will
result in no pay for the days missed.
         (b)   Sick days shall only be taken in a minimum of 1/2-day
increments.
      (2)   An employee must work 51% of the workdays of the preceding month in
order to earn a sick day for that month's service. Paid vacation is to be
included in the calculation. (See “Sick Time” in the Benefits section of this
handbook for additional information.)
§ 3.2 CARE FOR COUNTY PROPERTY
   (A)   Employees are expected to exercise care in his/her use of County
property and to use such property only for authorized purposes. Negligence or
carelessness in the use of County property may result in appropriate
disciplinary action.
   (B)   County equipment, including telephones, copying machines, the mail
system, facsimile machines, and computers should never be used for political
purposes. Employees who use County property for such purposes may be subject to
immediate termination.
§ 3.3 VEHICLE USE POLICY
   (A)   It is the general practice of the County to use County-owned vehicles
for business use. When an employee uses his/her personal vehicle in conducting
County business, that employee is eligible for reimbursement at the County's
approved rate for mileage reimbursement as set by the County Council.
   (B)   Prior to using personal vehicles for county business, all county
employees must provide their elected official or department head, and the
County Board of Commissioners, with copies of their personal automobile
liability insurance policy, and their valid operator's license.
   (C)   A county employee shall not use a county owned vehicle, or their own
vehicle for county business within the scope of their employment unless they
are covered by an automobile liability policy, and have a valid operator's
license.
   (D)   In the event a property damage claim is paid by an employee's personal
insurance company for a claim arising out of the use of a private vehicle under
this section, the county will pay the deductible not covered by the employee's
private insurance
   (E)   In certain instances an employee or office holder may be assigned a
county-owned vehicle and allowed to take that vehicle home and to use it for
personal use. This practice is known as “permissive use.” The personal use of a
county vehicle must be authorized in advance and the user is subject to any
applicable federal or state tax regulations governing such use.
   (F)   Any individual driving a vehicle owned by the County which is involved
in an accident/incident shall follow the following:
      (1)   All County-owned vehicles except Highway Department.
         (a)   Immediately call 9-1-1 and make a report;
         (b)   Call your supervisor;
         (c)   Call Karas Insurance at 219-779-9204, leaving message if no
answer;
         (d)   It is the driver’s responsibility to report the accident to
Karas Insurance on date of accident. Leave a call back number on Karas’
voicemail, if necessary;
         (e)   Complete incident report and follow instructions on form
(Exhibit A attached to Ord. 1356C-4, passed 8-8-2017, a copy of which is
available in the County Clerk’s office);
      (2)   Highway Department use only.
         (a)   Immediately contact Highway Department dispatch and report
accident/incident;
         (b)   Dispatch will immediately call local police department and
supervisor;
         (c)   Dispatch will call Karas Insurance at 219-779-9204. Driver must
confirm Karas called;
         (d)   It is driver’s responsibility to verify Karas Insurance was
notified on date of accident. Driver can also call Karas. Leave call back
number on voicemail, if necessary;
         (e)   Complete incident report and follow instructions on form
(Exhibit A attached to Ord. 1356C-4, passed 8-8-2017, a copy of which is
available in the County Clerk’s office).
   (G)   In addition, the County’s liability is significantly limited should
the vehicle be used for personal use. Specifically, the County’s liability is
limited to:
      (1)   Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for bodily injury to, or in
the death of one (1) individual;
      (2)   Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for bodily injury to, in the death
of two (2) or more individuals in any one (1) accident;
      (3)   Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for damage to or in the destruction
of property in one (1) accident.
   (H)   For further clarification regarding this policy, an employee should
contact the Lake County Board of Commissioners’ Attorney.
§ 3.4 COMPUTER POLICY
   (A)   The County's computer system provides a vital role in the efficient,
day-to-day operations of County government. The system includes computer
hardware, software and an electronic mail messaging (e-mail) system. In light
of the critical role that the computer system plays, a number of important
points regarding the use of the system are outlined below:
      (1)   The County's computer system and Internet access is designed to
improve efficiency in the workplace. The system should be used for official
purposes that assist in the conduct of business within the County. Use of the
Internet for personal use should be kept to a minimum.
      (2)   Computer documents composed, sent, or received on the County's
computer system are the property of the County and are not the private property
of any employee.
      (3)   As is the case with any other system or property belonging to the
County, the computer system and the Internet shall not be used to create, send
(transmit) or receive (download) any offensive or disruptive messages,
including those which are considered offensive or which contain sexual
implications, racial slurs, gender-specific comments, or any other comment that
offensively addresses someone's age, sexual orientation, religion, national
origin, or disability.
      (4)   Copyrighted materials, trade secrets, proprietary financial
information, or other protected or confidential materials should be safeguarded
and not reproduced without prior authorization.
      (5)   Given the uncertain nature, accidental access to obscene or
inappropriate websites may occur. In those circumstances, the employee should
immediately report the accidental access to his/her department head. Failure to
report accidental access may result in disciplinary action.
      (6)   Since the County is a public entity that conducts business for the
public good, it reserves the right to review, audit, intercept, access and
disclose all messages or materials created, received or sent over the County's
computer system or the Internet for any purpose. Any files, including e-mail
may be reviewed/disclosed by the County without the permission of the employee.
      (7)   The confidentiality of any computer document should not be assumed.
Even when a computer document is erased, it is still possible to retrieve and
read that computer document.
      (8)   All passwords, except those maintained by the County's appointed
and elected officials must be disclosed to Department Heads and to the
appropriate elected official.
      (9)   E-Mail and Internet are intended to be used for business purposes.
In the event that personal use occurs, that usage must not interfere with
business activities, must not involve solicitation, must not be associated with
any “for personal profit” outside business activity and must not potentially
embarrass the County Government, its taxpayers or its employees. Because e-mail
is being generated for County business, the user should realize that their e-
mail files are not private.
      (10)   Although the County reserves the right to retrieve and read any
documents, files or directories, these documents and sites should be treated as
confidential by other employees and accessed only by the intended recipient.
Employees should not attempt to gain access to another employee's computer
documents without the latter's permission. Employees are not authorized to
retrieve or read any computer documents that are not sent to them. Any
exception to this policy must receive prior approval by the appropriate elected
official.
   (B)   Any employee who discovers a violation of this policy shall notify
their department head or the appropriate elected official. Any employee, who
violates this policy or uses the County's computer system for improper
purposes, shall be subject to corrective action, up to and including discharge.
§ 3.5 SOCIAL MEDIA.
   (A)   Discussion, debate and sharing one's opinion occur in many forms and
forums including online conversations. Social media is defined as media
designed to be disseminated through social interaction, created using highly
accessible and scalable publishing techniques. Examples include, but are not
limited to, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and MySpace.
   (B)   Given the growing popularity of online media, Lake County Government
has developed a series of guidelines to assist its employees when engaging in
such forums and discussions. The guidelines are intended to assist employees
both when participating personally, as well as when acting on behalf of the
County.
      (1)   Protect Confidential and Proprietary Information: Do not post
confidential or proprietary information about the organization, clients or
vendors. Never violate federal law such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act). Employees who share confidential information do so at
the risk of disciplinary action or termination.
      (2)   Respect Copyright and Fair Use: When posting, be mindful of the
copyright and intellectual property rights of others.
      (3)   Don't Use Organization Logos: Do not use Lake County logos or any
other images or iconography on personal social media sites. Do not use the
County's name to promote a product, cause, or political candidate.
      (4)   Respect Time and Property: The County's computers and time on the
job are reserved for work-related business.
      (5)   Think Twice Before Posting: Privacy does not exist in the world of
social media. Consider what could happen if a post becomes widely known. Search
engines can turn up posts years after they are created, and comments can be
forwarded or copied. Exercise sound judgment and common sense, and if there is
any doubt, DO NOT POST IT.
      (6)   Strive for Accuracy: Get the facts straight before posting them on
social media. Review content for grammatical and spelling errors.
      (7)   Be Respectful: Understand that content contributed to a social
media site could encourage comments or discussion of opposing ideas. Responses
should be considered carefully in light of how they would reflect on the poster
and/or the organization.
      (8)   Personal Sites: Identify views as personal and employees should
refrain from identifying themselves as an employee of Lake County.
      (9)   Photography: Photographs posted on social media sites easily can be
appropriated by others.
      (10)   Know that the Internet is Permanent: Once information is published
online, it is essentially part of a permanent record, even if that information
is “removed/deleted” later or an attempt is made to make it anonymous. If a
complete thought, along with its context, cannot be squeezed into a character
restricted space (such as Twitter), provide a link to an online space where the
message can be expressed completely and accurately.
§ 3.6 TELEPHONE USE POLICY
   (A)   It is expected that personal telephone calls will be kept to a
minimum. Our success is in large part dependent upon our ability to respond to
the needs of our citizens promptly and efficiently. No long distance phone
calls of a personal nature are to be billed to the County except those
necessary due to emergency situations or to notify families of the need to work
late (these calls should be kept to a minimum length).
   (B)   Employees who are issued County owned cellular phones may use the
phones for business related use free of charge. The employee is responsible
however, for reimbursing the County for any personal calls that are incurred.
   (C)   Under no circumstances should a telephone or other equipment owned by
the County be used for political activity.
§ 3.7 CONFIDENTIALITY
   (A)   County employees work in an environment where the confidentiality of
information regarding residents and employees must be preserved. Medical
information or any information regarding fellow employees should always be
considered strictly confidential. The discussion of confidential matters with
other employees or in places where unintended parties can overhear such
information is forbidden. The reproduction of written materials or accessing of
unauthorized computer or electronic records is also forbidden. Departments are
encouraged to require employees to sign a confidentiality agreement.
   (B)   At the same time, state law requires the release of information,
including information regarding employees, to the public under certain
conditions and procedures. Only authorized individuals shall handle requests
for information.
§ 3.8 CUSTOMER SERVICE
   (A)   The County places a high value on providing quality services.
Employees are expected to demonstrate a strong customer service orientation by
treating customers in a courteous and respectful manner at all times. Customers
include taxpayers, fellow employees and anyone who seeks the assistance of an
employee of County government. Employees are encouraged to make suggestions
regarding policies, procedures, and practices that will improve service.
   (B)   An employee who encounters a disruptive, abusive or difficult member
of the public, should contact their supervisor for further guidance, direction
and assistance.
§ 3.9 DRESS CODE
   (A)   As servants of the public, employees must dress in a manner and
appearance that reflects professionalism.
   (B)   Those employees who are seen by and come in contact with the public
are expected to dress with the same or higher expectations as associated with
the private sector. Although requirements may be established by individual
departments and approved by the appropriate elected official, employees should
always dress in a manner that is appropriate for work and not distracting or
unprofessional.
   (C)   Attire that is distracting to other employees, such as revealing or
excessively tight-fitting clothing, clothes that are not clean or torn, or
clothing that displays logos or wording that might be viewed as offensive or
inappropriate by other employees or the general public should never be worn.
   (D)   Uniformed Employees - Employees who are furnished uniforms, including
shirts or partial uniforms, must wear the provided uniform attire each day when
reporting to work and performing duties. Employees are also responsible for the
care and maintenance of any uniform that is received.
   (E)   Casual Attire - Dependent upon the office holder or department head, a
relaxed style of attire may be allowed as part of the regular dress for work or
on certain days. Revealing, offending or distracting attire, jeans that are
tattered, torn, faded or otherwise inappropriate may still not be worn.
   (F)   Field Assigned Employees - Employees who are regularly assigned to
field duties must maintain a professional appearance when representing the
County in the field.
   (G)   The aforementioned guidelines should be viewed as minimum standards.
Employees should contact their department head for further details.
§ 3.10 OFFICE DECOR AND MAINTAINING WORK AREAS AND EQUIPMENT
   Employees are responsible for maintaining their work areas in a clean and
orderly fashion. Untidy and disorganized work areas can lower productivity by
making even simple tasks more difficult and may even contribute to workplace
accidents. Pets are generally not allowed in the workplace unless medically
required for assistance.
§ 3.11 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL: TERMINATION, DISCIPLINE, REHABILITATION
   (A)   The following activities present a threat to the safety, welfare and
integrity of the County and its employees, and will result in an employee being
discharged on a first offense:
      (1)   The unlawful manufacture, distribution, possession, consumption, or
use of drugs or drug paraphernalia in the workplace or on County time and the
use or consumption of alcohol in the workplace.
      (2)   The unlawful manufacture or distribution of drugs outside the
workplace.
      (3)   The consumption of alcohol within four (4) hours prior to
performing scheduled safety-sensitive functions. The term “scheduled” does not
apply to an event where an off-duty employee is requested to perform work in
the event of an emergency or call out. However, the employee retains the
responsibility to notify his/her supervisor that consumption of alcohol has
occurred rendering that person unfit for duty. Failure to notify one's
supervisor may be cause for appropriate disciplinary action or termination.
      (4)   Refusing or failing to submit to an alcohol and/or a drug test.
      (5)   Refusing or failing to cooperate with the collection process during
drug and/or alcohol testing.
      (6)   Attempting to contaminate a drug test.
   (B)   The following activities by County employees are prohibited and will
result in a three step process as specified below:
      (1)   The unlawful possession, consumption, or use of drugs outside the
workplace.
      (2)   Performing any job function with an alcohol concentration of 0.04
or greater, as determined by an evidentiary breath test.
      (3)   The use of alcohol within eight hours following an accident which
requires an employee to be tested for alcohol, unless the employee has already
taken a post-accident evidentiary breath test.
      (4)   Testing positive for a drug/alcohol test.
   (C)   A violation of the above prohibitions will result in the following
consequences:
      (1)   If a first offense occurs, an employee will be required to
participate in a rehabilitation program selected, provided and paid for by the
County (through any combination of insurance and County subsidy). In addition
to the rehabilitation program, the County will assume the cost of follow-up
testing as well as continued regular pay for the employee. Should the employee
fail to participate or complete the program, he/she will be subject to
immediate termination.
      (2)   For a second offense, the employee is subject to a thirty (30)
calendar day suspension without pay and is required to pay the cost (except any
portion covered by insurance) of and attend an appropriate rehabilitation
program selected by the County. The employee will also be responsible to pay
all costs of any follow-up drug and alcohol testing as required by the County.
Should the employee fail to participate or complete the program, he/she will be
subject to immediate termination.
      (3)   For a third offense (or positive result on a drug and alcohol
test), the employee will be terminated.
   (D)   An on-call employee is subject to reasonable suspicion and drug and/or
alcohol testing if, when responding to a call, a trained supervisor reasonably
concludes that objective facts may indicate prohibited drug and/or alcohol use.
Appropriate discipline (as described in this policy) shall apply.
§ 3.12 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
   (A)   Employees have the right to work another job or career provided that
it does not interfere with the employee's duties with the County and does not
create a conflict of interest. The following would constitute “interference”
with an employee's duties:
      (1)   The conducting of private outside employment during employee's
regular work hours.
      (2)   Repeated tardiness or absenteeism due to outside employment.
   (B)   At no time may County resources be used to further private outside
employment.
§ 3.13 EMPLOYEE ETHICS
   (A)   Citizens, businesses and visitors alike look to government to be a
model example of an ethical organization. First and foremost we must embrace
the concept that the general public will have confidence that the conduct of
County business is always conducive to the public good.
   (B)   Conflicts of Interest - No County employee shall engage in any act
which is in conflict or creates an appearance of fairness, or conflict with the
performance of official duties. An employee shall be deemed to have a conflict
if the employee:
      (1)   Has any financial interest in any sale to the County of any goods
or services in which such financial interest was received with prior knowledge
that the County intended to, purchase the property, goods, or services.
      (2)   Solicits, accepts, or seeks a gift, gratuity, or favor from any
person, firm, or corporation involved in a contract or transaction which is or
may be the subject of official action by the County.
         (a)   Recognizing that personal friendships often precede and can
evolve from official contact between employees and persons engaged in business
with the County, reasonable exceptions to this section are permitted for those
occasions which are social in nature and are not predicated on the employee's
ability to influence, directly or indirectly, any matter before the County.
         (b)   The employee will be guided in interpretation of this section by
the distinction between a gift, gratuity, or favor given or received which has
significant monetary value and is offered or accepted in expectation of
preferential treatment, and an expression of courtesy. Examples of acceptable
courtesies include: a meal or social event; exchanges of floral offerings or
gifts of food to commemorate events such as illness, death, holidays, and
promotions; a sample or promotional gift of nominal value ($100 or less).
      (3)   Participates in his/her capacity as a County employee in the
issuing of a purchase order or contract in which he/she has a private pecuniary
interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to such contract, some
function requiring the exercise of discretion on behalf of the County.
      (4)   Engages in, accepts employment from, or renders services for
private interests for any compensation or consideration having monetary value
when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of
official duties or would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in
performance of official duties, or give the appearance of the above. An
employee should not make a unilateral decision if there is any doubt about his/
her private employment. The appropriate elected official's office should be
consulted.
      (5)   Except for courtesies as provided in item (2) above, no employee
shall, directly or indirectly, give or receive or agree to receive any
compensation, gift, reward, commission or gratuity from any source except the
County for any matter directly connected with or related to his official
services as such employee with this County.
      (6)   Discloses or uses without authorization, confidential information
concerning property or affairs of the County to advance a private interest with
respect to any contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of
official action of the County.
      (7)   Have a financial interest or personal interest in any legislation
coming before the County Council and participates in discussion with or gives
an official opinion to the County Council unless the employee discloses on the
record of the Council the nature and extent of such interest.
   (C)   Use of Public Property
      (1)   No employee of the County shall request, use, or permit the use of
County owned vehicles, clothing, equipment, materials, unpublished information
or other property for unauthorized personal convenience, for profit, for
private use, or as part of secondary employment. Use of such County property is
to be restricted to such services as are available to the County generally and
for the conduct of official County business (See “Care For County Property
Policy” [this section] for specific information). Telephones and fax machines
serve as important tools and need to be used for official business; personal
calls should be kept to a minimum (See “Telephone Use Policy” [this section]
for specific information).
      (2)   Authorized personal uses include taking an assigned County vehicle
to lunch, on workdays as needed. Use of County issued cellular phones for
personal calls providing those calls are reimbursed to the County, and other
nominal personal uses as permitted by the appropriate elected official on a
case-by-case basis.
   (D)   Political Activities Conducted On Government Time
      (1)   Political activity on government time is strictly prohibited. This
prohibition includes, but is not limited to: soliciting contributions or
anything of value for a political candidate or cause; distributing literature,
badges, buttons, signs, or stickers promoting or opposing any political
candidate or cause; and, organizing, planning, or in any other way
participating in the administration of any political campaign, including
speaking in favor of or in opposition to any political candidate or cause.
      (2)   Working time includes the working time of both the employee
conducting political activities and the employee to whom such activities are
directed, but does not include break, lunch, or other duty-free periods of
time.
   (E)   Solicitation and Distribution
      (1)   Because solicitation and distribution activities may interfere with
normal operations, reduce employee efficiency, inconvenience employees, annoy
customers, and pose a threat to security, the County prohibits these activities
on its premises by non-employees and only permits solicitation and distribution
by employees under certain approved conditions where the County may authorize
fund drives by employees on behalf of charitable organizations or for employee
gifts. Employees are encouraged to volunteer to assist in these drives, but
participation is entirely voluntary.
      (2)   Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action. Ethics
training is offered by the County Human Resources Consultant several times per
year.
§ 3.14 GUIDELINES FOR CONDUCT
   (A)   This policy applies to all County employees including those covered by
a collective bargaining agreement, unless the bargaining agreement or contract
explicitly addresses the issue in a manner contrary to this chapter. In those
instances, the terms of the bargaining agreement or contract will supersede the
terms of this chapter.
   (B)   Organizations need regulations to govern the conduct of employees,
maintain smooth operations, and provide general direction. The County is no
exception. Rules have been enacted to help maintain safe and desirable working
conditions for everyone, and are posted for general information and to ensure
equitable and uniform corrective action when necessary. In order to demonstrate
an accurate account of any incident that results in discipline, an employee's
supervisor should complete a written report of any improper action.
Disciplinary action will be issued by the supervisor upon review and
authorization by the department head. In matters of Category IV violations,
these actions must first be reviewed by the elected official to whom that
employee ultimately reports (or his/her designee) before being issued (See also
the “Suspension/Termination of Employment” in this section of this handbook).
   (C)   The County reserves the right to depart from these guidelines and to
take action up to and including immediate discharge when, in its opinion, such
action is necessary to protect the well being of the County or its employees.
   (D)   It is impractical to attempt to list all types of misconduct that may
result in disciplinary action; therefore, the following are only basic
guidelines:
      (1)   Category I - The County expects proper procedures and actions of
its employees including, but not limited to: being on time; showing respect to
co-workers, supervisors and visitors; reporting personal injuries; following
normal daily procedures; and notifying one's supervisor in advance of any
tardiness or absence. When an employee does not abide by these regulations, it
is the supervisor's responsibility to work with the employee to correct the
employee's behavior. If there is no improvement, the employee will be notified
that his or her behavior or lack thereof, is not in accordance with County
policy. This notification will be made verbally with written record of the
discussion placed in the employee's file.
      (2)   Category II - When an employee fails to adhere to safety rules,
creates conditions that are unsanitary or potentially dangerous to other
employees, displays rudeness/discourtesy to the public, walks off the job
without authorization, causes waste of materials or parts due to carelessness,
reports to work in dirty clothing or in an unclean manner, uses or possesses
another employee's personal tools without consent, engages in a minor act of
sexual harassment, engages in verbal confrontations that disrupt the workplace,
neglects to properly perform assigned duties, incurs excessive unexcused
absences, engages in activities that are unethical such as performing personal
work on County time, or when an employee commits a second Category I violation
within 12 months of the last discipline issued, that employee will be notified
in writing that his or her behavior is not appropriate. Subsequent violations
could lead to additional action including suspension and termination.
      (3)   Category III
         (a)   These actions are more serious in nature and have significant
impact on the County or its employees. They include: being under the influence
of alcohol or deliberate abuse of prescription or illegal drugs; specific
refusal to follow legitimate directions from one's supervisor or conduct that
directly challenges the legal or legitimate authority of a supervisor or
manager; commits an act of sexual harassment; posting, altering or removing any
matter on a County bulletin board without authorization, disorderly conduct;
reckless damage to a vehicle or other County property of less than $2,500.00;
failure to report within forty-eight (48) hours any accident; a pattern of
negligence in carrying out assigned duties, threatening or intimidating another
employee; concealing defective work; use of government equipment, tools,
materials or other County property for personal use; sleeping on the job;
carrying an unauthorized passenger in a County vehicle during work hours;
violating departmental safety rules; or the violation of County Policy.
         (b)   An employee who commits any of these infractions or any other
infraction viewed by the County as serious misconduct, or who commits a second
violation of the guidelines contained in Category II within 12 months of the
last discipline issued, will be suspended without pay for 3 to 5 days, along
with other measures that may be applicable (e.g. counseling). A subsequent
violation could lead to additional action including termination.
      (4)   Category IV
         (a)   When an employee commits a deliberate action that is deemed
inexcusable, that employee will be subject to immediate dismissal. Such actions
include deliberate damage of property; a serious violation of County Policy/
ordinance, Indiana or Federal law; conviction of a felony; actions that
endanger the health and welfare of another employee; deliberate negligence in
carrying out one's job responsibilities; the use of physical force against
another individual; damage to a County vehicle or equipment that totals
$2,500.00 or more; theft, willful tampering with equipment or computer
programs; gross insubordination; falsification of records - including time
cards, release of confidential information; unreported absence for three (3)
days; possession of illegal drugs and alcohol (all instances of alleged
substance abuse or intoxication shall be handled pursuant to methods prescribed
in Ordinance 7415); possession of weapons, firearms or explosives, physical or
sexual assault or abuse; a second violation of a Category III regulation within
12 months of the last discipline issued; or any other extremely serious action.
Such behavior will result in an immediate suspension without pay for 5 days
pending review for termination by the department head or elected official.
         (b)   The foregoing listing of causes for disciplinary action is to
help illustrate the County's progressive disciplinary policy and does not
preclude the County from disciplining employees for reasons not specifically
listed. In addition, the County reserves the right to depart from the
aforementioned guidelines in matters where the circumstances demand a stronger
or milder response.
   (E)   Documentation/Procedures For Discipline
      (1)   All disciplinary action, including a verbal reprimand, will be
documented. The County's Disciplinary Action Form should be completed in its
entirety with all facts documented. The forms shall be signed by the supervisor
and the disciplined employee. In the event the employee refuses to sign, a
witness should sign to verify that the employee was given the opportunity to
review the form. An employee who is disciplined shall be given the opportunity
to respond, explain or comment in writing when discipline is issued.
      (2)   Discipline shall be administered discreetly and explained clearly
to the employee. As noted in the “Guidelines for Conduct,” the seriousness of
the offense will be considered when discipline is issued. In certain instances,
the County reserves the right to depart from the aforementioned guidelines in
matters where the circumstances demand a stronger or milder response.
      (3)   The Board of Commissioners (or in the case of another division, the
appropriate elected official/office holder) should be consulted by the
department head or supervisor if there is any question regarding the
appropriate discipline.
   (F)   Types of Disciplinary Actions
      (1)   Oral reprimands are for the first offenses which do not require
suspension. Oral reprimands should be documented for future reference and
should include a warning to the employee that a subsequent violation could
result in further disciplinary actions.
      (2)   Written reprimands may be issued if an oral reprimand has not
corrected the problem or if the violation is not serious enough to require a
suspension. The reprimand shall specify which further disciplinary actions
could result from subsequent violations.
      (3)   Suspension without pay shall be administered for repeat offenses or
where required immediately due to the nature of the offense. The first day of
suspension shall be the first day in which the employee works less than 51% of
the workday.
      (4)   Immediate discharge or dismissal shall be imposed where prior
disciplinary actions have not corrected the behavior or where, due to the
seriousness of the offense, such action is required.
      (5)   The supervisor must document and file the disciplinary action taken
within five (5) working days of notification of the incident. Failure to act
within this period will render the action moot and without force or effect.
      (6)   Disciplinary actions may be appealed pursuant to the terms of the
grievance procedure established with this personnel policy.
   (G)   Notice Of Changes To The Guidelines For Conduct
      (1)   A copy of the County's “Guidelines for Conduct” shall be provided
to each new employee upon hiring and to all current employees. Copies of the
policy will also be available from the County's Human Resources Office.
      (2)   It is important for employees to be made aware of any changes to
this policy. Department heads shall be responsible for advising employees of
any changes in the policy. Since any change to these guidelines must be adopted
by ordinance, the County Council Attorney shall be responsible for the
conspicuous posting of any changes or amendments made to the policy and for
notifying the County departments of those changes.
§ 3.15 MEDIATION.
   (A)   Filing a request for hearing - Most problems can be resolved through
discussion with one's supervisor or elected official. When such informal
dispute resolution fails, and an employee believes that he/she has been treated
unfairly, that employee may file a request for a mediation hearing. The
mediation process is not intended to modify or change existing policy and is
designed to find common ground between the two parties. A mediation request may
not be filed by an employee who is terminated. Employees who feel that they
have been discriminated due to race, sex, religion, age national origin, mental
or physical challenge, political affiliation, or protected speech in violation
of civil or constitutional rights should follow the County's policy on
discrimination, and contact the County's Human Resources Consultant (219 853-
9782) instead of seeking mediation.
      (1)   Problem Resolution Mediation/Purpose - Most problems can be
resolved through discussion with one's supervisor or elected official. However,
when such informal dispute resolution fails, and as the employee believes that
he/she has been treated unfairly, or unjustly disciplined, that employee may
petition the County's Mediation Panel in an attempt to bring together and find
a reasonable resolution to this disagreement.
      (2)   Mediation Panel Decision/Termination - A decision of the Mediation
Panel is final but not binding. The County's mediation procedure does not apply
to employees who work for the Judiciary, the Prosecuting Attorney, or are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A mediation petition request form
shall be filed with the County's Human Resources Consultant. A mediation
petition may not be filed by an employee who is terminated. The mediation panel
shall not hear a petition regarding termination of employment.
      (3)   Mediation Panel Membership - A three member Mediation Panel is
established to hear qualified petitions. The three member Mediation Panel shall
be selected as follows:
         (a)   Chairman - The chairman of the panel shall be the County's Human
Resources Consultant.
         (b)   Management Member - One member shall be chosen by the party that
has been charged (the “Offending party”) from a four member group known as the
Management Group. The four members will be appointed to the Group by the
following officials/bodies:
            1.   One appointed by the Lake County Board of Commissioners
            2.   One appointed by the Lake County Council
            3.   One member appointed through agreement of the Lake County
Auditor, Recorder, Surveyor and Treasurer
            4.   One member appointed through agreement of the Lake County
Clerk, Coroner, Sheriff and County Assessor (Township assessors are represented
by the Assessor)
         (c)   Employee Member - One member shall be chosen by the employee
filing the petition from a group of three full-time employees, known as the
Employee Group, which are elected for a two (2) year term by full-time Lake
County employees.
      (4)   Qualifications of Members - Members of the Management Group and
Employee Group must meet the following qualifications to serve:
         (a)   Be a resident of Lake County.
         (b)   Except for the Chairman, members may not be vendors under
contract with Lake County.
         (c)   No member may be an elected official of Lake County Government.
         (d)   Employee member must be a full-time employee of Lake County in a
full-time position and not be in a management or supervisory position.
         (e)   Management member must be a full-time employee of Lake County
and must be in a management or supervisory position.
         (f)   An employee member shall not sit on a Mediation Panel if the
petition is filed against the officeholder or department where he/she is
employed.
      (5)   Election of County Employee Member - The three (3) member county
employee group shall be elected by the following rules that shall be posted in
each county office at least 29 days prior to the beginning of the election
process outlined below.
         (a)   Nominations. Nominations of employee members (who meet the
qualifications for the membership of the panel listed in this section) must be
made by at least one other employee and must be seconded by a second employee
or the nominee. The nomination process shall be open for ten working days,
commencing upon written notice issued by the Panel Chairman and distributed to
all employees. Nominations shall close at 4:00 p.m. on the tenth working day.
Nominees may submit a brief statement of their qualifications to be elected to
the employee member group.
         (b)   Nominee Information. A list of nominees and their statements of
qualifications shall be sent by facsimile to all county offices and department
heads and posted in the offices for at least ten (10) days before election.
         (c)   Elections
            1.   Eligibility and Voting: A full-time county employee who
qualifies as an employee covered by this employment policy shall be entitled to

   (A)   No Employee or agent of the County, whether full or part-time, paid or
volunteer, other than a duly sworn County police officer, general services
officer or other individual authorized by statute to carry a weapon on behalf
of the County, shall carry or possess a firearm or other deadly weapon
(exceptions to this policy include small pocket knives or a rescue knife
carried by appropriate personnel) during working hours, while on duty, or while
otherwise engaged in County business or on County property. In accordance with
Indiana state statute, an employee may possess a firearms weapon if it is
stored in his/her vehicle on County property, and providing that the vehicle is
locked.
   (B)   A violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action
including termination.
§ 3.17 VIOLENCE-FREE WORKPLACE
   (A)   It is the policy of the County to ensure the safety of all employees
by maintaining a workplace free of violence. Workplace violence can occur in
many forms including: any verbal or physical action that is communicated or
perceived as a threat, harassment, abuse, intimidation, or personal contact
that produces fear for personal safety, causes bodily harm or damage to
property.
   (B)   Employees are asked to take appropriate measures to keep the workplace
harmonious and to treat co-workers, supervisors, and the general public with
respect. Employees should not, under any circumstance, react to a threat of
violence, verbal assault, or rude behavior. Rather, employees should
immediately remove themselves from the situation and report the threat to their
supervisor or department head.
   (C)   Violating this policy makes an employee subject to discipline, up to
and including discharge.
   (D)   Right of Inspections and Inquiry
      (1)   When the County deems it necessary to ensure the safety of County
property; to provide a secure workplace; to prevent the possession, use, or
sale of illegal drugs; or possession of alcohol in the workplace, the County
reserves the right to:
         (a)   Search employee areas.
         (b)   Question employees.
      (2)   In addition, the County may inspect the contents of lockers,
storage areas, file cabinets, desks, offices, and work stations at any time.
All searches may be conducted at the County's discretion and without notice.
Employees are expected to cooperate with searches and inspections. Employees
who fail to cooperate are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge.
      (3)   Furthermore, employees are subject to disciplinary action
appropriate to policy violations uncovered during a search/inspection.
   (E)   Damage, Loss, or Theft of County Property, Equipment, and Supplies -
All employees are expected to exercise reasonable care to protect County
property, equipment, and supplies from damage, loss, and/or theft. Employees
are responsible for the proper care and return of all property, equipment, and
supplies used to perform work and/or assigned to their possession. An employee
who has reason to believe that County property, equipment, and/or supplies are
in danger of being damaged, lost, or stolen is expected to immediately report
this to his or her department head.
   (F)   Damage, Loss, or Theft of Employees' Personal Property - Employees are
expected to exercise reasonable care for their own protection and for that of
the personal items they bring to work. The County is not responsible for the
loss, damage, or theft of personal belongings. Employees are advised not to
carry unnecessary amounts of cash or other valuables with them when they come
to work.
§ 3.18 SAFETY AND HEALTH
   (A)   Although accidents occur in the workplace, most are avoidable by
carefully and safely performing one's job duties. It is important to use the
proper equipment such as a ladder when having to reach overhead objects or to
use one's knees (instead of just one's back and arms) when having to lift a
heavy box or object. Some jobs require the wearing of personal protective
equipment (PPE) such as eye wear, ear protection and footwear with reinforced
toes or gripping soles. PPE and performing job-duties with the proper equipment
are just a few of the many steps that an employee can take to avoid an
accident.
   (B)   If an employee becomes injured at work, he/she must report that injury
to their supervisor immediately. Supervisors should also be notified
immediately of any fires, hazardous conditions, or injuries to others.
   (C)   It is the County's policy to comply with the Indiana Workers'
Compensation Laws and to aid any employee whose injury or illness is determined
to be compensable under those laws. The County pays for all costs associated
with providing this coverage and the insurance carrier will make all payments
and decisions pertaining to compensable injuries or illnesses.
   (D)   If an employee is hospitalized or incurs medical costs as a result of
a job-related injury or illness, the employee's department head should be
notified as soon as possible. If absence from work is required as a result of a
job related injury or illness, the employee will be required to furnish a
statement from a physician stating that he/she is able to work before returning
to work.
   (E)   An employee suffering a work-related injury and/or illness must report
the condition immediately, but no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the
time of the incident, to his/her supervisor or department head. If the accident
or injury happened at work but requires medical treatment after going home, an
employee should see a doctor of their choice or go to the emergency room at the
local hospital. The employee should advise their supervisor or department head
of the name of the doctor or hospital where treatment was received as soon as
possible, but no later than forty-eight (48) hours from the time of the
incident. Failure to immediately report an injury or illness could result in
jeopardizing the employee's worker's compensation claim should the injury be
more serious than first determined.
§ 3.19 SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT
   The County, including all of its buildings, is smoke-free. Employees are not
permitted to smoke and/or vape e-cigarettes or similar devices while in a
County building. In accordance with Indiana state statute, smoking is not
allowed within 8 (eight) feet of an entrance.
§ 3.20 STAFF IDENTIFICATION BADGES
   (A)   Each employee is issued an identification badge (I.D.) with his or her
photograph on it for identification purposes. The purpose of the I.D. is to
identify an employee of the County while performing his/her duties. It should
never be used as a form of identification outside of work.
   (B)   The I.D. must be turned in when employment terminates. An employee
should immediately report a lost or stolen badge to their supervisor. Should an
I.D. become damaged, an employee may turn in the damaged tag for replacement at
no cost. If an I.D. is lost, a $5.00 replacement fee may be charged.
SECTION 4- EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The benefits outlined in this section apply to all County employees including
those covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless the bargaining
agreement or contract explicitly addresses the issue in a manner contrary to
this chapter. In those instances, the terms of the bargaining agreement or
contract will supersede the terms of this chapter.
The County provides a number of benefits to its employees. Although some
benefits are required by law, most benefits are provided voluntarily to
employees as part of the overall compensation that an employee receives. Many
of the benefits provided exceed those normally provided in the private sector.
This section represents an outline of benefits and is not a full explanation/
description. Employees who desire more detailed information regarding a
specific benefit should contact the appropriate source as listed or the
Insurance Department.
§ 3.21 INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS - PERSONNEL TRAINING
   (A)   Personnel of the County whose official duties include receiving,
processing, depositions disbursing, or otherwise having access to funds that
belong to the County, Federal Government, State Government, a political
subdivision, or another governmental entity shall be trained once during a
calendar year, and annually thereafter, unless on administrative leave status,
pursuant to the County's Uniform Internal Control Standards and Materiality
Policy and any other standards and procedures determined necessary by the
County and shall cooperate with the Auditor so that the Auditor can timely
certify to the State Board of Accounts that the training was received annually
by those personnel as required by law.
All new County hires shall be trained pursuant to the County's Uniform Internal
Control Standards and Materiality Policy.
§ 4.1 LIFE INSURANCE
   All regular full-time employees are provided a life insurance policy at no
cost to those employees covered by the County's Health Insurance Plan, and
$1.00 to those employees who are not covered by the plan. The amount of the
policy is equal to one year's salary (the amount is equal to the employee's
base pay and does not include overtime). Please contact the Insurance
Department for additional details. (See Voluntary Supplemental Benefits for
additional life insurance benefits)
§ 4.2 HEALTH INSURANCE
   (A)   Regular full-time employees and statutory full-time employees are
eligible for single (employee) or family (dependent) coverage administered for
the County by private contract. Coverage includes: medical, prescription,
dental and vision benefits. Contributions and coverage limits may vary. Please
contact the Insurance Department for additional information regarding current
rates and coverage.
   (B)   A regular full-time employee is an employee who has completed his or
her orientation period and who works on average at least thirty-five hours or
more per week.
   (C)   A statutory full-time employee is an employee who is paid out of a
regular full-time employee position, who in fact may not work at least 35 hours
per week, but who receives benefits by virtue of State statute, reimbursement
agreement with the State or Federal government, or is an elected or appointed
official, judge or magistrate, pursuant to the Indiana Constitution, or State
statute.
      (1)   These are employees who may work less than 35 hours per week but
for budget purposes are placed in job classifications where the salary is based
upon working 35 hours per week and for whom health benefits must be provided by
State statute or reimbursement funding agreements watts the State of Indiana or
the Federal government. This includes County elected or appointed officials,
judges and magistrates in a position created by the Indiana Constitution, or
State statute.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Section I.C., in order to implement the Settlement
Agreement entered into between the Lake County Superior Court and the Lake
County Council dated March 13, 2018, in Order for Mandate of Funds in the Lake
Superior Courts, 45D10-1701-CB-00003, Judges and Magistrates appointed to a
position of Judge or Magistrate after January 1, 2019, shall be ineligible to
participate in any and all current and future health care coverage and benefits
provided by Lake County Government. However, Judges or Magistrates appointed
after January 1, 201 9, who were either a Judge or Magistrate in the Lake
Superior Court on December 31, 2018, small be covered.
   (D)   In those cases where union pensions and welfare funds are involved,
the County will make the appropriate contributions pursuant to the collective
bargaining agreement.
   (E)   Cobra Rights
      (1)   Employees and their families will have the opportunity for a
temporary extension of health insurance coverage in certain instances where
coverage under the County’s health plan would otherwise end. Only those
employees, as well as the employee’s spouse and dependents who were covered
under the County’s health insurance plan on the day before the event which
triggered termination of coverage are eligible to elect continuation of
coverage.
      (2)   Employees who are covered by the County’s health insurance plan
have a right to elect continuation coverage if a loss of group health coverage
occurs because of a reduction in hours of employment or the termination of
employment. Generally, an employee is eligible for up to eighteen (18) months
of continuing coverage although the length of coverage may be extended under
certain circumstances due to an employee disability, and for coverage of
dependents and spouses. COBRA rights may be withheld to the employee for
certain reasons of gross misconduct.
§ 4.3 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE
   (A)   The County recognizes that employees may need time off to care for the
medical needs of themselves, their children, their spouses and their parents.
In order to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), the County
has developed this policy to provide eligible employees the necessary
flexibility to manage their careers and family needs. To the extent that the
FMLA provides greater family or medical leave rights to employees than are
provided under existing policies, the requirements of the FMLA will prevail and
will supersede existing policies. Leave time taken under other policies, which
would qualify as leave under the FMLA, will be taken into account when
computing the FMLA leave.
   (B)   The following information should be viewed only as an outline of FMLA.
Please contact the Human Resource Consultant for specific details.
   (C)   Eligibility
      (1)   To be eligible for the FMLA, an employee must have been employed
for at least twelve (12) months and must have worked at least 1,250 hours
during the previous twelve (12) month period. The FMLA entitles eligible
employees to take up to twelve (12) weeks unpaid leave of absence during a
twelve (12) month rolling period. Leave may be taken on either a “block” basis
(from the start date continuously until the employee returns or leave is
exhausted) or on an intermittent basis. In the event that the leave is
intermittent, leave will be granted in increments of no less than 15 minutes.
      (2)   FMLA leave does not need to be taken in conjunction with leave due
to an on-the-job injury (worker compensation).
   (D)   Reasons For Leave - Employees may be granted 12 (twelve) weeks of
leave for any of the following reasons (unless otherwise noted):
      (1)   To care for a newborn child, newly adopted or newly placed foster
child. The employee's right to leave for this reason ends twelve (12) months
after the birth, adoption or placement of the child with employee.
      (2)   To care for a family member such as a spouse, child or parent who
has a serious health condition (under the care of a health provider) and
prevents that individual from performing their regular activities for three or
more days.
      (3)   For a serious health condition (under the care of a health care
provider) which debilitates the employee and prevents that individual from
being able to perform his/her duties at work for three or more days.
      (4)   Exigency Leave - Any qualifying exigency (arising out of the fact
that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active
duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the
Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation.
      (5)   Servicemember Family Leave - An employee who is the spouse, son,
daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member shall be entitled
to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for the
service member. The leave described in this paragraph shall only be available
during a single 12-month period. During the single 12-month period described
above, an eligible employee shall be entitled to a combined total of 26
workweeks of leave.
   (E)   Written Notification - All notification of leave under the FMLA,
including extensions, will be provided to County employees in writing in
accordance with federal regulations. In turn, the employee will also make all
requests for such leave in writing. In those situations where, due to an
emergency, notification cannot readily be provided in writing, the employee
will be requested to provide such notice as soon as possible using all
federally approved forms. Employees have a responsibility to notify their
employer as soon as possible once they are aware that a leave that may qualify
under FMLA may be needed. Employees seeking leave should contact the County
Insurance Department in addition to their supervisor/office holder.
   (F)   Computing Leave Time - The twelve (12) month period for taking leave
will be measured on a rolling calendar basis measured from the last leave. In
the event that the leave is taken intermittently, the leave shall be measured
from the first day of leave.
   (G)   Extension of Leave - FMLA leave may not be extended beyond twelve (12)
weeks to any employee without the written approval of the department head and
elected official.
   (H)   End of Leave Notification - Departments are required to notify the
County's Human Resources Consultant at least two (2) weeks prior to the end of
any leave so that proper federally approved forms may be sent to the employee
notifying him/her of the end or extension of their leave.
   (I)   Special Limitations - The Act includes a special provision in the
event of a birth, adoption or placement of a foster child, and where both
parents are employed by the County. In those cases, a total of 12 weeks of
leave is available to the parents and may be taken in any combination of leave
providing the total taken by both individuals does not exceed 12 weeks.
   (J)   Substitution of Paid Leave  
      (1)   FMLA leave is unpaid. However, employees who are eligible for
short-term disability must utilize that leave in conjunction with FMLA.
Employees must use all accrued sick leave while on FMLA, except for five (5)
days which may be banked for future use. In addition, the employee may, at his/
her discretion, substitute vacation which they have earned or accrued for part
or all of the FMLA leave and count it against the maximum twelve (12) week
entitlement (or in the event of a servicemember leave, twenty-six (26) weeks).
      (2)   An employee who exhausts his/her FMLA and all paid time off
(vacation, sick/personal time) may be provided up to 10 (ten) days of unpaid
leave in the succeeding twelve (12) months (from the last day of leave)
following an approved leave, subject to the approval of that employee's
department head/elected official in consultation with the County's Human
Resource Consultant.
   (K)   Health Insurance Coverage While On Leave - Group health and/or dental
insurance coverage for employees while on leave will be continued on the same
basis as coverage would have been provided had the employee been continuously
employed during the leave period. Any share of health and/or dental insurance
premiums which had been paid by the employee prior to the leave, must continue
to be paid by the employee during the leave period. If paid leave is
substituted as discussed above, the employee's portion of the premium will be
paid by payroll deduction. If all or part of the leave is unpaid, the employee
must make arrangements with the Insurance Office for a mutually agreeable
schedule for paying the employee's portion of the premium. The employee's
failure to make the necessary contributions will lead to the cancellation of
group health and/or dental insurance coverage.
   (L)   Failure to Return from FMLA Leave - If the employee does not return to
work following leave (depending on the reason for the employee's failure to
return to work), the County reserves the right to recover all group health and/
or dental insurance premiums paid by the County during the leave period. The
reimbursement will be based on the cost of COBRA coverage.
   (M)   Status Report and Medical Certification Prior to Returning from Leave
      (1)   An employee on FMLA leave must report to their department head
every two (2) weeks on his/her status (including if leave is taken for a family
member), as to whether they intend to return to work and the date which they
will return to work, if known.
      (2)   Employees who take FMLA leave due to their own serious health
condition must provide a fitness-for-duty medical certification from their
treating health care provider prior to being permitted to return to work. Under
no circumstances will an employee who fails to provide certification be
permitted to return to work. Fitness-for-duty is not required if leave is taken
to care for a family member.
   (N)   Job and Benefit Protection
      (1)   Employees returning from FMLA leave will be given the same job they
had when they left on leave or an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits
and other employment terms, including no loss in years of service. Employees
who fail to return to work at the end of leave, lose their rights to be
returned to their former jobs or equivalent positions.
      (2)   The use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment
benefit that accrued prior to the start of leave. However, employees will not
accrue any type of leave benefit while they are on non-pay status.
   (O)   Changes in Regulation - The Family and Medical Leave Act is subject to
updates, changes and amendments by Congress and the U.S. Department of Labor,
Wage and Hour Division. In the event that such change conflicts with this
handbook or other County policy, the current federal law or regulation shall
apply.
   (P)   Definitions - The following definitions will be used:
      (1)   A “child” refers to a biological, adopted, foster, or “step” child,
a legal ward, or a person less than eighteen (18) years of age, for whom the
employee has the responsibility to provide care and support, Additionally, a
“child” is considered a person eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of
self-care due to a physical or mental disability. A “parent” refers to an
individual's natural parent or a parent who has/had legal custody of a child as
described above. The aforementioned age definition shall not apply to leave
taken for the care of a servicemember or due to an exigency leave.
      (2)   Health care provider includes:
         (a)   Doctors of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice
medicine
         (b)   Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists,
chiropractors, nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical social workers
(each performing within their scope of practice)
         (c)   Christian Science practitioners listed with the First Church of
Christ, Scientist of Boston, or
         (d)   Any health care provider recognized by the County's group health
plan.
§ 4.4 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE

required.
   (D)   In certain situations where the death of a spouse, child or parent has
occurred and extenuating circumstances exist, special provisions may be made by
the department head after discussion with the elected office holder.
§ 4.5 HOLIDAYS
   (A)   Paid holidays are designated annually by the County Council. Holidays
for union members and County employees shall be the same unless a collective
bargaining agreement provides otherwise.
   (B)   The County's ability to provide quality services during the rest of a
workweek when a holiday occurs is extremely important. If an employee is absent
without proper authorization (an approved paid day off is considered an
authorized day off) on the last working day before a holiday or the first
working day after a holiday, he/she will not be paid for the holiday.
   (C)   If a holiday falls during a scheduled vacation, an employee need not
take a vacation day for the declared holiday to receive full pay for that week.
   (D)   Holiday compensation is counted as hours worked for the purposes of
overtime. An employee who works a scheduled holiday shall be compensated at a
rate of one and one-half times the employee's normal rate of pay if the total
number of hours worked during the week exceeds forty hours. Compensation may be
provided in payor compensatory time.
§ 4.6 EMPLOYEE BIRTHDAY HOLIDAY
   All full time employees are eligible for a day off with pay for their
birthday after completing their probationary period. In the event that the
birthday falls on a weekend, other paid holiday, or on a day in which County
Government is closed, the birthday holiday may be taken on any other day during
the week following the actual birthday (the specific date must be approved by
the employee's department head). In the event that two employees have the same
birthday, and having two employees at the same time absent would impact
operations, the department head may choose an alternative date for one of the
two employees during the week following the actual birthday.
§ 4.7 JURY DUTY AND SUBPOENAED WITNESS
   When an employee is required to serve as a juror or subpoenaed witness, that
employee will receive his/her full regular pay (straight time only) subject to
the following provisions:
   (A)   The employee must notify his/her supervisor within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of notice of selection for jury duty or as soon as
practicable after receipt of a subpoena.
      (1)   If serving jury duty, the employee must furnish a written statement
from the appropriate public official showing the date and time served and the
amount of pay received.
      (2)   If serving as a subpoenaed witness, the employee must show the
subpoena signed by a proper party and showing the amount of compensation
received for such services.
   (B)   The employee must sign over any check (excluding mileage) received for
serving as a juror or witness to the County Court Administrator if the jury
duty is in the County Court System (Circuit or Superior). If the jury duty is
at any other level (federal or state), the check should be signed over to the
Lake County Auditor's Office.
§ 4.8 MILITARY LEAVE
   (A)   The County encourages and supports employees who choose to serve our
nation in the armed forces. In certain cases where an employee is called to
military service, either for active duty or annual training, that employee may
be entitled to reinstatement/reemployment and other rights under the Uniform
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (“USERRA”). To qualify
under USERRA, the employee's separation from military service must be under
honorable conditions and he/she must meet the other requirements of the law. In
order to qualify for County-sponsored benefits, military service must be in
compliance with the following conditions:
      (1)   Eligibility: An employee who must be absent from work due to
military duty (either voluntary or involuntary) must provide advance notice to
his/her department head as soon as possible, along with a copy of his/her
military orders which identifies the time period for the leave as specifically
as possible.
      (2)   Reinstatement: In order to be eligible for USERRA and County-
sponsored benefits, employees returning from a military leave lasting fewer
than thirty one (31) days, must report back to work at the beginning of the
first regularly scheduled work day following the completion of military
service.
      (3)   Reemployment: In those situations where military leave lasts more
than thirty (30) days but less than one hundred eighty-one (181) days, an
employee must submit an application for reemployment within fourteen (14) days
of the completion of military service to be eligible for USERRA and County-
sponsored benefits. An employee on a military leave that lasts longer than one
hundred eighty-one (181) days must submit an application for reemployment
within ninety (90) days of the completion of military service. In any case
where the military leave exceeds more than thirty (30) days, the employee must
provide official military documentation identifying the period of military
service to establish that the application for reemployment was timely and that
the discharge was honorable.
   (B)   Benefits: Upon reemployment, an employee restored to the level of
benefits attained had he/she provided continuous service to the County and as a
result, all rights and benefits determined by length of service (including
vacation, sick and personal time) will reflect continuous employment. In
addition, an employee will be eligible for health benefits from the County's
plan (if a current member) on a secondary basis (to any coverage provided by
the U.S. Armed Forces), for up to twelve (12) months, so long as he/she
continues to pay his/her employee contribution.
   (C)   Compensation: An employee will be permitted up to four (4) weeks of
paid military leave per calendar year provided that he/she has completed one
(1) year of service with the County. Compensation will be computed by taking
the employee's hourly rate of pay, multiplied by forty (40) hours, less the
earnings received from military service. This compensation is contingent upon
the County's payroll department receiving adequate advance written notice of
the military leave and official military documentation indicating the amount of
earnings received while on military leave. New employees (those with less than
one (1) year of service may elect to use paid time off in conjunction with
military leave.
§ 4.9 SICK DAYS/PERSONAL LEAVE
   (A)   The County provides full-time employees with sick and personal days.
Sick time should be used only for legitimate illness of an employee, his/her
spouse or child (under 18 years of age), while personal time may be used to
attend to personal issues/business during regularly scheduled workdays. Accrued
sick time must be used in conjunction with any approved Family and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA) leave.
   (B)   Employees are provided sick days depending on the date of hire.
Employees hired prior to 5/13/2003 receive a total of 12 (twelve) days per year
and may be used in any combination of sick or personal leave. Employees hired
on or after 5/13/2003 receive a total of 10 (ten) days per year and may be used
in any combination of sick or personal leave. Leave may be taken in half or
full day increments (see the Flexible Schedule section for details as to how
such leave applies to employees working a flexible schedule).
   (C)   Except for probationary employees who earn sick/personal leave on a
monthly basis, eligible employees receive their full amount of sick/personal
leave each January. The employee's full allotment of sick/personal days is
available for use beginning each January 1st.
   (D)   An employee who is absent for three or more days shall be required to
provide his/her supervisor with a doctor's statement (in accordance with
federal health privacy laws) indicating that the employee was unable to work.
The abuse of sick time may lead to disciplinary action.
   (E)   Carry Over of Unused Time - Employees may carry up to six (6) days of
unused sick/personal leave annually. All leave carried over may be used as sick
leave only. Employees may accumulate up to a maximum of fifty (50) days. Bank
days may be used for an illness that incapacitates an employee for 3 (three) or
more days and for which that employee is under the care of a healthcare
provider.
   (F)   Probationary Employees - Although employees begin earning sick/
personal time from the first day of hire, probationary employees may not use
such time until after completing their probationary period. Should the employee
be terminated prior to completing the probationary period, that employee is not
entitled to payment for the time earned.
   (G)   Retirement or Separation Value - Generally, employees are not eligible
for payment or reimbursement for unused sick or personal time upon termination
(voluntary or involuntary). An exception to this policy is provided to
employees who are retiring and are eligible for a PERF pension (See “Mandatory
Benefits - PERF” for details). A retiring employee shall be reimbursed at a
rate of one (1) day's pay for every three (3) days of sick time. Payment of
this benefit will be made on the employee's last paycheck.
   (H)   Additional Provisions
      (1)   Sick leave accruals are transferred if the employee changes to
another department within the County and remains a full-time employee. Sick
leave is always paid at the current rate of pay when taken.
      (2)   If an employee becomes ill or injured while on vacation, the
scheduled vacation shall be counted as vacation, if the disability continues
beyond the scheduled time of vacation, the sick leave allowance (if any) shall
begin on the first scheduled working day after the end of the scheduled
vacation.
      (3)   Each department shall have a complete record-keeping system of
employee's sick time earned and taken.
§ 4.10 SHORT TERM DISABILITY
   (A)   Employees who have completed at least one full year (12 months) of
employment with the County are eligible for up to 12 weeks of short term
disability. This benefit provides an employee who is unable to work (due to
other than a work related injury) $100.00 per week during the absence (not to
exceed 12 weeks). If the absence also qualifies for leave under the Family and
Medical Leave Act, the short term disability benefits will be paid congruent to
any non-paid leave (it will not be paid for those periods covered by vacation
or sick time.
   (B)   In the event that an employee does not use his/her entire allotment of
disability leave during an approved FMLA leave, that employee retains the
unused balance of disability leave for the remainder of that calendar year.
Unused leave does not "rollover" to subsequent years.

years of service with an existing municipality shall receive ten (10) days of
vacation after ninety (90) days of service and pro-rated during the first year
of service. The employee’s vacation earnings shall transfer to the county’s

year of service.
         (c)   Employees with at least five (5) years of service less than ten
(10) years of service with an existing municipality shall receive twelve (12)
days of vacation after ninety (90) days of service and pro-rated during the
first year of service. The employee’s vacation endings shall transfer to the
county’s regular vacation schedule beginning with January of the employee’s
eighth (8th) year of service.
         (d)   Employees with at least ten (10) years of service with an
existing municipality shall receive fifteen (15) days of vacation after ninety
(90) days of service and pro-rated during the greater of service and pro-rated

ninety (90) days of service and pro-rated during the first year of service. The
employee’s vacation endings shall transfer to the county’s regular vacation
schedule beginning with January of the employee’s thirteenth (13th) year of
service.
         (f)   Employees covered by this policy shall not advance (outside of
this policy) in the regular county vacation policy until completing the years
of service as noted above at which time, the employee will be converted to the
regular vacation schedule.
         (g)   The aforementioned vacation shall be selected by the employee’s
start date with the county. No other consideration for seniority shall be
granted. Vacation shall be scheduled accordingly by the Department head.
   (F)   General Guidelines
      (1)   Vacation time is not granted until earned. Vacations shall be
scheduled within each department pursuant to the needs of the department and
the ability of the remaining staff to do the work in a proper manner. Vacation
should be taken in no more than one week increments unless approved by the
department head and appropriate elected official. A vacation may be split into
blocks of time less than one week providing that such a schedule does not
hamper office functions. A scheduled vacation may be changed in case of an
emergency.
      (2)   Department heads shall have the authority to designate certain time
periods in the year during which no vacations may be taken if the prohibition
is based upon the necessity of operations.
      (3)   Generally, vacation time must be taken in the year that it was
provided. However, an employee, with the approval of their department head, may
carryover up to one week of vacation provided that the time is used prior to
April 30th of the following year.
      (4)   Time of service by the employee is transferable between County
departments and/or County divisions. The value of a vacation is determined at
the time of use, rather than when the vacation was earned.
      (5)   Whenever a holiday falls during an employee's scheduled week of
vacation, he/she does not need to use a vacation day for that holiday.
      (6)   If an employee becomes ill or injured while on vacation, the
scheduled vacation time shall be counted as vacation days rather than sick
days. If the illness/disability continues beyond the scheduled vacation time,
the sick leave allowances (if any) shall begin on the first scheduled working
day after the scheduled vacation.
      (7)   If an employee is terminated for any reason, all unused vacation
will be paid to the employee (or in the event of an employee death, to the
survivor).
   (G)   Use of Vacation In the Event of Illness/Disability
      (1)   In the event that an employee exhausts all of his/her short term
disability benefits, FMLA leave or sick or personal leave, that employee must
then utilize any unused vacation. Upon exhausting any unused vacation, the
employee may become eligible for COBRA benefits.
      (2)   During a non-paid leave of absence, vacation time will not accrue.
For each full month an employee is on a leave of absence, the employee will not
earn vacation days which would otherwise be taken the following year. The
following schedule shall be applied when calculating vacation time for an
employee who was on a non-paid leave of absence.
 
Amount Eligible To Earn Amount Deducted For Each Full Month Absent
Two weeks               .5 day
Three weeks             1.0 day
Four weeks              1.5 days
Five weeks              2.0 days
Six weeks               2.5 days
 
      (3)   This provision does not affect vacation time previously earned.
   (H)   Conversion to Flexible Schedule - If an employee is assigned to a
compressed or flexible schedule (a schedule where an employee normally works
more than eight hours a day or fewer than five workdays per week), that
employee's vacation days are converted to hours rather than days. For example,
an employee who has earned two weeks of vacation is entitled to eighty (80)
hours of paid vacation time.
§ 4.12 WORKER COMPENSATION
   (A)   When any employee, regardless of status (full, part, temporary,
seasonal, etc.) is injured on the job, he/she must immediately notify his/her
supervisor. He/she will be directed to the medical provider assigned by the
County's insurance department for treatment and must obtain a release to return
to work from the same provider before returning to work. Employees may not
receive treatment from his/her own physician for treatment of a work-related
injury.
   (B)   If an employee is injured or disabled while working (at his/her County
position) and must, due to that injury or disability, miss work (a physician
has certified that the employee is unable to work) the employee will not be
paid during a five (5) calendar day waiting period that begins on the first day
of incapacity. After the waiting period, he/she will be paid at the rate set
for an employee on worker's compensation. During the five day waiting period an
employee may use any available sick/personal or vacation time.
   (C)   When an employee is injured on the job, he/she is not entitled to
receive both full pay from the County (by the use of sick/vacation days) and
benefits from worker compensation for the same period of time. Although the
actual length and amount of worker compensation coverage varies, a maximum
limit of 500 weeks of compensation is set by state statute.
   (D)   Additional Provisions
      (1)   When he/she returns to work after sick leave (Leave of Absence)
from an on-the-job injury, he/she will again begin to earn sick days.
      (2)   If an employee misses work for an on-the-job injury for which
worker compensation pays benefits, the County shall continue insurance benefits
(as they were when the employee was working). The employee is responsible for
making his/her normal contribution. Once such worker compensation benefits end,
the employee must obtain and maintain his/her own insurance (at a cost equal to
the COBRA rate).
      (3)   When an employee misses work due to an on-the-job injury, he/she
must submit a statement from the County's medical provider estimating how long
it will be before he/she may return to work. If the employee is not able to
return to work pursuant to the provider's estimate, he/she must obtain and
submit an additional statement from the medical provider, extending that leave.
When returning to work, an employee must bring a medical release to return to
work.
      (4)   The County provides “light duty” in those cases where the
department has that type of work available and a physician has authorized such
work. The release should state how long the “light duty” could be expected to
be in effect. If the department does not have any “light duty” available, the
employee must be cleared by the County's medical provider before returning to
work.

§ 4.16 PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY
   Notwithstanding Lake County’s Family and Medical Leave Act Policy (FMLA), §
4.3 Family and Medical Leave, the following Parental Leave Policy shall be
established:
   (A)   Lake County shall offer four weeks of 100% paid parental leave to
eligible full-time employees to provide parental care after birth or adoption
of an employee’s child. Paid parental leave is intended to give new parents
additional flexibility and time to bond with their new child, adjust to their
new family situation, and balance their professional obligations.
   (B)   Eligibility.
      (1)   Parental leave is available to all full-time and benefit-eligible
employees who have been employed with the county for at least 12 months and
have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the
leave.
      (2)   Parental leave may only be taken following the birth of an
employee’s child of for adoption of a minor child (under age 18). An individual
who adopts a spouse’s child is not eligible for parental leave.
      (3)   Parental leave is available only to employees whom are primary
caregivers of the newborn or adopted child. Both parents may be primary
caregivers.
      (4)   Human Resources is responsible for administering this policy and
determining eligibility for parental leave.
   (C)   Benefit Provisions.
      (1)   Parental leave is compensated at 100 % of the employee’s regular,
straight-time weekly pay and is paid on a bi-weekly basis on regularly
scheduled pay dates. Parental leave does not reduce an eligible employee’s
balance of any other paid leave such as sick, vacation, or floating holiday.
      (2)   Paid parental leave is a benefit of employment and will not be
considered as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring,
promotions, and disciplinary actions.
      (3)   Parental leave may be taken continuously or in one-week increments
within the first six months following the birth or adoption of a minor child.
Parents who choose to take parental leave incrementally must consult with his
or her supervisor and make a reasonable effort to schedule incremental parental
leave so as not to unduly disrupt the department’s operations.
      (4)   As with other forms of paid leave, benefits will remain the same
while an employee is on parental leave. For example, vacation and sick leave
benefits will continue to accrue, the county will continue to pay its share of
the cost of an employee’s group health insurance and the employee’s share of
the premium will continue to be deducted from the employee’s pay. Similarly,
all deductions from income will continue during parental leave.
      (5)   If a county recognized holiday occurs during parental leave, the
holiday will be paid. Use of holiday pay, however, does not extend the length
of parental leave.
      (6)   Parental leave runs concurrently with any available FMLA leave for
the same qualifying birth/adoption, so any leave taken under this policy that
also qualifies as FMLA will count toward the 12 weeks of available FMLA in a
12-month period. Employees on parental leave are ineligible to work alternative
employment.
      (7)   lf an employee on parental leave is eligible for short term
disability benefits, her/his short-term disability will offset, and are not in
addition to, the salary continuation provided under this policy.
      (8)   lf both parents are employed by the County of Lake, they may take
the parental leave concurrently or at separate times, according to their
preference.
      (9)   Parental leave is only available to an employee once in a 12-month
period.
      (10)   Any unused paid parental leave will be forfeited at the end of the
six-month time frame. Upon termination, or upon a change in employment status
to position that is not eligible for benefits (e.g., transition from full-time
to part-time), unused paid parental leave will not be paid.
   (D)   Request Parental Leave. Eligible employees interested in parental
leave must provide their supervisor and Human Resources with notice from a
physician of the anticipated leave at least 30 days prior to the proposed date
of the leave (or if the leave is not foreseeable, as soon as possible).

         (b)   The Lake County Recorder shall provide a copy of the form
contact to all bulk users who wish to receive bulk form copies of recorded

   (D)   Fees charged for bulk form copies.

of documents recorded per day, as the second largest county in the state, it is
determined that the costs incurred by the Lake County Recorder of producing

all other fees for bulk form copies required by law to be charged for services
rendered by the County Recorder to bulk users.

Recorder and if the County Recorder uses a third party to provide bulk copy
services, the County Recorder's designee, in order to receive bulk form copies.
The contract must be in writing and must require that the bulk user agree not
to do any of the following:

may terminate the contract, immediately stop providing bulk form copies to the
bulk user, and refuse to provide the bulk form copies required by the bulk user

the County Recorder. The County Recorder may refuse subsequent requests from a
bulk user for bulk form copies in the following circumstances:

contract terminated by the County Recorder because the Recorder determined that
the bulk user filed to comply with the contract.

which a person has a majority or controlling interest, and:
            1.   The person requested bulk form copies under a previous

County Recorder determined that the person failed to comply with the contract.

      (1)   (a)   A bulk user that is licensed under I.C. 27-1-15.6-6(d) or

copies related to the specific order for a title search (as defined in I.C. 27-
7-3-2) when operating as:
            1.   A title plant for the issuance of title insurance (as defined
in I.C. 27-7-3-2); or
            2.   Title company (as defined in I.C. 27-7-3-2).
         (b)   A bulk user that meets the requirements of this division (F)(1)
may charge its customers a fee for using the bulk form copies obtained by the
bulk user that may not exceed the costs incurred by the bulk user for obtaining
the bulk form copies. A bulk user that meets the requirements of this division
(F)(1) may not resell, provide,
transfer, or allow the transfer of any copy of a recorded document, whether in
bulk form or as individual copies or images, to any other bulk user or title
plant.

immediately above is prohibited from selling, offering for sale, advertising
for sale, soliciting a purchase of, loaning, giving away, allowing subscription
service to, or otherwise transferring, provide, or allowing the transfer of
bulk form copies for commercial purposes to a third party, whether the copies
are in bulk form or individual copies or images.

preferring and delivering charges, in writing, to the corrections officer,
obtaining the consent of the officer's waiver of a hearing before the Board.

Board reject the waiver, any such disciplinary action shall be taken in
accordance with these rules and after a decision by the Board.
         (d)   The Sheriff, with the approval of the Corrections Merit Board,
may revert the non-probationary corrections officer back to probationary
status, for up to six months, for cause, after preferring and delivering the
charges, in writing, to the corrections officer's consent, in writing, to
accept the status. The consent will also be made before the Board by the
corrections officer, in person.
         (e)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(d) are mutually exclusive.
   (C)   Dismissal, demotion and suspensions. A county corrections officer may
not be dismissed, demoted, or temporarily suspended because of political
affiliation nor after his or her probationary period, except as provided in

A notice of the charges and hearing must be delivered by certified mail to the
officer to be disciplined. The officer may be represented by counsel. The Board
shall make specific findings of fact in writing to support its decision.
      (2)   Relief from duties. When formal charges are pending with the Merit
Board, the Sheriff may, without the approval of the Board relieve the
corrections officer from active duty with the Department pending the hearing,
before any decision by the Board. This action may be taken when retention of
the corrections officer on active duty, would "not be in the best interests of
the Department", based upon the nature of the violation in question.
         (a)   With pay. When a corrections officer is relieved from active
duty by the Sheriff under this section, the corrections officer shall receive
his or her pay and benefits as if on active duty with the Department.

benefits, effective the date of the conviction.
         (c)   Without pay/pending criminal felony charges. When a corrections
officer is relieved from active duty, by the Sheriff, under this section, for
the reason that the Corrections Officer has been charged with the commission of
a felony, then, and in that event, the corrections officer may be relieved of
duty and/or suspended, without pay and benefits, effective the date of the
filing of the criminal information or indictment, or at any date subsequent,
thereto, as determined by the Sheriff with approval of the Merit Board at its
next meeting.
   (E)   Appeal under division (D). An appeal under division (D) must be taken
by filing in court, within 30 days after the date the decision is rendered, a
certified complaint stating in concise manner, the general nature of the
charges against the officer, the decision of the Board, and a demand for the
relief asserted by the officer. A bond must also be filed that guarantees the
appeal will be prosecuted to a final determination and that the plaintiff will
pay all costs only if the court finds that the Board's decision should be
affirmed. The bond must be approved as bonds for costs are approved in other
cases. The county must be named as the sole defendant and the Plaintiff shall
have a summons issued as in other cases against the county. Neither the Board
nor the members of it may be made parties defendant to the complaint, but all
are bound by service upon the county and the judgment rendered by the Court.
   (F)   All appeals tried by the court. All appeals shall be tried by the
court. The appeal shall be heard de novo only upon any new issues related to
the charges upon which the decision of the Board was made. Within ten days
after the service of summons, the Board shall file in court a complete written
transcript of all papers, entries, and other parts of the record relating to
the particular case. Inspection of these documents by the person affected, or
by the person's agent, must be permitted by the Board before the appeal is
filed, if requested. The court shall review the record and decision of the
Board on appeal.
   (G)   Court to make specific findings. The court shall make specific
findings and state the conclusions of law upon which its decision is made. If
the court finds that the decision of the Board appealed from should in all
things be affirmed, its judgment should so state. The court shall make a
general finding, setting out sufficient facts to show the nature of the
proceeding and the court's decision on it. The court shall either:
      (1)   Reverse the decision of the Board; or
      (2)   Order the decision of the Board to be modified.
   (H)   Final judgement may be appealed. The final judgment of the court may
be appealed by either party. Upon the final disposition of the appeal by the
courts, the Clerk shall certify and file a copy of the final judgment of the
court to the Board, which shall conform its decisions and records to the order
and judgment of the court. If the decision is reversed or modified, then the
county shall pay to the party entitled to it, any salary or wages withheld from
the party pending the appeal and to which he or she is entitled under the
judgment of the court.
   (I)   Change of venue. Either party shall be allowed a change of venue from
the court of a change of judge in the same manner as such changes are allowed
in civil cases. The rules of trial procedure govern in all matters of procedure
upon the appeal that are not otherwise provided for by this section.
   (J)   Appeal takes precedence over pending litigation. An appeal takes
precedence over other pending litigation and shall be tried and determined by
the court as soon as practical.

      (1)   Each subcontractor of any tier shall be required to adhere to the
requirements of division (A) above of this section, but subcontractors shall
submit the required information to the successful bidder, who shall then submit
said information to the Lake County Board of Commissioners prior to the
subcontractor's first day of work on the public works project.
      (2)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default or breach by the successful bidder.
However, payment shall be withheld from any subcontractor who fails to timely

Lake County. Additionally, Lake County may require the successful bidder and/or
relevant subcontractor to remove a subcontractor from the project and replace
it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor.
      (3)   The disclosure of a subcontractor by a bidder or a subcontractor
shall not create any rights in the disclosed subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/
or a subcontractor may substitute another subcontractor for a disclosed
subcontractor by giving Lake County written note of the name, address, and type
of work the substitute subcontractor will perform. The substitute subcontractor
is subject to all of the obligations of a subcontractor under this section.
   (C)   Validity of pre qualification classification.

still be permitted to bid on or perform work on city public works projects.
      (2)   Any material changes to the contractor’s status, at any time, must
be reported in writing within
ten days of its occurrence to the county. The pre-qualification designation is
solely within the discretion of the county and the county specifically reserves
the right to change or revoke the designation for a stated written reason(s).
      (3)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be
forwarded to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any
contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status may request
reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the
county within five business days of receipt of notice of denial.
   (D)   Incomplete submissions by bidders. It is the sole responsibility of
the bidder to comply with all submission requirements herein no later that the
public bid opening. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by
Lake County shall result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.
   (E)   Responsive and responsible bidder determination. After its review of
complete and timely submissions, taking into account all information in the
submission requirements, Lake County shall in its sole discretion, determine
whether a bidder or subcontractor is responsive and responsible. Lake County
reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the bidder or
subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by Lake County through
its own independent verification of the information provided.
   (F)   Certified payroll.
      (1)   For projects in which the cost is at least $150,000, the successful

its successor form, which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to
the county within ten calendar days after the end of each week in which the
successful bidder or subcontractor performed on the public work project.
Certified payroll reports shall identify the job title and craft of each
employee on the project, e.g. journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician.
In the event any successful bidder or subcontractor uses independent
contractors to perform work on the project, such individual must be identified
on the WH-347 or successor form with the same information as is required for
employees.
      (2)   The county may withhold payment due for work performed by a
successful bidder or subcontractor for failure to timely submit their
respective certified payroll reports until such time as the reports are
submitted. The county shall not withhold payment to a successful bidder or
subcontractor for failure of the successful bidder or one or more other
subcontractors to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
   (G)   Public records. All information submitted by a bidder or a
subcontractor pursuant to this section, including certified payrolls, are
public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public
Records Law (I.C. 5-14-3).
   (H)   Penalties for false, deceptive, or fraudulent statements/information.
Any bidder or subcontractor that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be
made, a false, deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false,
deceptive or fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to

§ 35.50 UNIFORM INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS AND MATERIALITY POLICY.
   The county has developed the following Materiality Policy to address State
Examiner Directive 2015-6 as follows:
   (A)   Designation of point person(s)/position. All erroneous or irregular
variances, losses, shortages or thefts of funds or property either owned or
held in trust by the County must be reported to Internal Control Advisory
Committee. In the absence of the Internal Control Advisory Committee, or in the
event the Internal Control Advisory Committee is a party to the reported
variance, the Internal Control Advisory Committee will serve as an alternate to
the Internal Control Advisory Committee.
   (B)   Cash and non-cash materiality threshold. The county must report to the
Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) any erroneous or irregular variances,
losses, shortages, or cash in excess of $50,000 and non-cash items in excess of

below the dollar threshold based on a qualitative evaluation of the matter.
   (C)   Action steps when a matter is reported. County personnel are
responsible for completing an incident report with the Internal Control
Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control Advisory Committee. The Internal

electronic folder and Word or Excel summary document that sequentially numbers,
dates and accounts for each report submitted.
      (2)   Read the incident report to determine the nature of the loss,
shortage, or theft and evaluate whether it is erroneous or irregular. The
Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control Advisory Committee
will document a conclusion on whether the matter is subject to the materiality
policy. If not subject to the policy, the Internal Control Advisory Committee
and/or Internal Control Advisory Committee will close the incident and retain
documentation in accordance with the county's record retention policy.
   (D)   For losses, shortages, or thefts that are considered erroneous or
irregular, the Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control
Advisory Committee will perform the following steps to better understand the
matter and measure the dollars at risk:
      (1)   Determine what further questions or documentation may be required.
The Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control Advisory
Committee will determine whether the matter should be escalated within the
county organization based on their understanding of the nature of the matter.
      (2)   Conduct an investigation of the matter through interviews and
documentation gathering based on the investigation plan.
      (3)   Measure the actual or potential dollar amounts at risk (cash and
noncash) to determine whether the incident is considered material.
      (4)   Measure the qualitative impact of the incident.
      (5)   Document conclusion on whether the incident is material or
qualitatively significant.
   (E)   For erroneous or irregular losses, shortages, or thefts considered
material or qualitatively significant the Internal Control Advisory Committee
and/or Internal Control Advisory Committee must:
      (1)   Determine if there is actual knowledge or reasonable cause to
believe a misappropriation of public funds occurred. For matters considered to
be misappropriation of public funds, the Internal Control Advisory Committee
and/or Internal Control Advisory Committee will document the county's
understanding of the incident, report the matter to appropriate county
officials and determine the communication protocol for expedient reporting to
the SBOA and the local prosecutor's office.
      (2)   For matters not considered to be a misappropriation of public
funds, the Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control Advisory
Committee will document the County's understanding of the matter including why
the County believes the matter was not considered a misappropriation of public
funds.
      (3)   Report the matter to the SBOA immediately upon confirming the
variance, loss, shortage, or theft.
   (F)   For all matters (material or immaterial) reported under the
materiality process, the Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal
Control Advisory Committee will perform the following steps:
      (1)   Identify the core reason for the incident and document the
ineffective internal control design and/or internal control implementation as
applicable to each incident.
      (2)   Analyze and measure the risk to determine significance and perform
a cost-benefit analysis on the implementation of potential mitigating controls.
      (3)   Create a corrective action plan and/or document resolution of the
matter.
      (4)   Design and implement, or update, internal controls to prevent ant
mitigate future risk, as determined necessary.
      (5)   Maintain a centralized repository for documentation and resolution
of all incidents reported, including:
         (a)   Materiality policy document;
         (b)   Incident log;
         (c)   Incident reports and documentation;
         (d)   County documentation supporting its investigation and
evaluation;
         (e)   Support qualifying the lost, shortage, or theft as erroneous or
irregular;
         (f)   Support determining the materialism of each incident;
         (g)   Standardized incident report form;
   (G)   The Internal Control Advisory Committee and/or Internal Control
Advisory Committee will utilize either the notification link on the SBOA
website, telephone, or in-person reporting to report material erroneous or
irregular variances, losses, shortages, or thefts.

Committee is hereby established to assist county officials in performing all
the duties and responsibilities required by I.C. 5-11-1-27 in developing and
adhering to the Uniform Internal Control Standards and Materiality Policy.
   (B)   The Committee shall consist of no less than three or no more than 14

(Ord. 1402D, passed 11-15-2016)
§ 35.52 RESTRICTED HOME ADDRESS POLICY.
   (A)   Scope. This policy applies to, and only to, Lake County’s public
property database website that:
      (1)   Is available to the general public over the internet;
      (2)   Does not require registrations subscription or the creation of a
user name and password to search the website; and
      (3)   Connects a covered person’s home address to the covered person’s
name, so that search of the website for the covered person’s name discloses the
covered person’s address.
   (B)   Person’s covered. I.C. 36-1-8.5 provides a means for an individual
defined as a “covered person” to submit a written request to have their home
address restricted from disclosure on a public property database website. The
restricted information will not be made available to a member of the general
public. This policy applies to the following “covered persons” as more
particularly defined in I.C. 36-1-8.5-3, 36-1-8.5-4, 36-1-8.5-4.5 and 36-1-8.5-
6, which definitions are incorporated herein by reference:
      (1)   A judge;
      (2)   A law enforcement officer;
      (3)   A victim of domestic violence; or
      (4)   A public official.
   (C)   Responsible department. The Lake County Auditor’s Office, by law
charged with oversight of the public records for the county, shall have the
responsibility for receiving requests for restricted addresses made by covered
persons.
   (D)   Application for restricted addresses.
      (1)   By an individual. An individual covered person desiring to restrict
his or her address shall complete and file with the Lake County Auditor the
Application for Restricted Access form attached to Ord. 1395B as Exhibit A. (A
copy of Ord. 1395B is available for public inspection in the county offices
during normal business hours.) The Auditor will verify (with applicable
agencies, if necessary) that the submission is valid and the applicant is a
“covered person.” Victims of domestic violence must submit proof of program
participation in the Indiana Attorney General’s address confidentiality
program. lf an application is denied by the Auditor, the applicant may appeal
in writing to the Board of Commissioners.
      (2)   By a cooperative agency. The municipal police departments of Lake
County, Lake County Sheriff’s Department, Prosecutor’s Office or similar agency
(a “cooperative agency”') may agree to provide the Auditor’s office an annual
bulk request including all current covered persons within the department or
agency. This list shall also include those individuals who have moved from
their primary residence or are otherwise no longer a “covered person.” This
list shall remain confidential pursuant to I.C. 36-1-8.5-11.
      (3)   Post-application requirements.
         (a)   Should any changes to the title of a covered parcel occur, the
Auditor will remove that parcel from the restricted address list and a new
request must be made by a “covered person”' to again include that parcel on the
restricted list. If a covered person transfers title to or moves from a covered
parcel, it is his/her responsibility to file a new application for a new
covered parcel. This policy is in effect for requestor's primary residence only
per I.C. 36-1-8.5-7. If the requestor owns or is involved in additional
properties that utilize the primary home address as to the mailing address,
will be displayed. If the applicant wishes to have those addresses removed as
well, a new application is required for each.
         (b)   Should a person have a name change after submitting a written
request for a title of a covered parcel occur, the Auditor shall be notified in
writing of the name change and shall prevent a search by general public of the
public property data base web site from disclosing or otherwise associating the
covered person’s home address with the covered person's former name and new
name.
   (E)   Results of changes to access of property information.
      (1)   Lake County MVP public database. Public search results will reflect
the changes made to the MVP database for those records marked as
“confidential.” These records will display “Information withheld in accordance
with I.C. 36-1-8.5-4” in place of the name information. Once the option to
suppress has been enabled for a specific parcel the request will be forwarded
upon request, to other appropriate county offices for their use in changing
internal office databases that may reflect information specifically related to
“covered persons”' as defined by I.C. 36-1-8.5. It is the intention of Lake
County to comply with the intent of the code to not make the property
accessible by means of removing the link between name and parcel information.
      (2)   Internal county property record databases. Property information
stored on internal county databases will still exist and be made available to
the public per request, unless blocked by state statute.
   (F)   Confidentiality. All applications made to the county by a covered
person are confidential records and not subject to public access.
   (G)   Immune. The county may not be held liable for failure to timely
restrict disclosure or an address under this chapter unless its act or omission
constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.
   (H)   Application fees.
      (1)   Exclusion. Victim of domestic violence will be excluded from fees
imposed under this section.
      (2)   Initial request. No fee will be assessed for a requestor’s primary
residence site (home address). A $10 per parcel fee will be assessed for
additional parcels that make reference to the requestor’s primary residence
site (home address).
      (3)   Additional requests. No fee will be assessed for new parcel
requests not included in the original written request to restrict public access
to a covered person’s home address.
      (4)   Change in name of title. A fee of $10 will be assessed for any
changes in the name of title of the covered person.
      (5)   Requests to allow disclosure. There is no charge assessed when a
covered person submits a written request to allow public access to the person’s
home address on the public property database web site. This action removes a
previous request to restrict public access to covered person’s home address.
   (I)   Amendment. The county reserves the right to amend or revise the
contents of this policy as deemed suitable. The revised policy will be
available on the County Auditor’s page of the county website.

with the discount results in the MBE or WBE having a lower computed price, then
the contract shall be awarded to the MBE or WBE;

FOR FEDERAL AND STATE GRANT REPORTING
§ 35.60 ORGANIZATION AND POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter establishes the official policies and
procedures for the Internal Review Division within the Office of the Auditor.
It explains the purpose, authority and responsibility of the internal review
function and the duties of the Internal Review Division, which consists of the
Grant Committee, Grant Supervisor, and the Budget Liaison Director.
   (B)   Authority.

Commissioners (Commissioners), the Lake County Council (Council), and the
county departments.
      (2)   Recognizing the importance of government compliance with federal
laws, policies, established procedures and accountability for the use of
federal funds while performing its duties, the Auditor, Commissioners and
Council have established the Internal Review Division.
      (3)   The Internal Review Division is responsible for reviewing the

Review Division will endeavor to assist Commissioner administrators and county
department managers in achieving compliance with financial reporting. These
efforts are intended to ensure county compliance in order to fulfil the
county's fiduciary responsibilities to the federal government
   (D)   Mission strategy. The Internal Review Division will accomplish its
mission to provide Lake County with an efficient, proactive and comprehensive
internal review program through the conduct of:

organization, property, financial transactions and methods of business related
to federal grants.
(Ord. 1376A, passed 9-24-2014)
§ 35.61 METHOD OF OPERATION.
   (A)   Internal review functions. The following describes the functional
operation of the Internal Review Division and the requirements for
accomplishing its mission:
      (1)   Definition and objective of internal review. Internal review is an
independent objective assurance activity designed to add value and improve
operations of the county as a service to management and elected officials. The
fundamental objective of internal review is to assist all members of management
to discharge their responsibilities. This objective is met by furnishing
management with periodic reviews and recommendations concerning the federal
grant related activities.
      (2)   Scope of operations. The Internal Review Division's scope of
operations encompasses revenues and expenditures of federal grant awards. This
requires going beyond the accounting and financial records to obtain a full
understanding of the operations under review and involves such activities as,
but is not limited to:
         (a)   Perform a periodic review of the financial statement(s) for the
federal program in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (GAGAS);
         (b)   Obtain an understanding of internal control and perform tests of
internal control over the federal program consistent with the requirements of
§___.500(c) for a major program;
         (c)   Perform procedures to determine whether the county department
has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant
agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the federal program
consistent with the requirements of §___.500(d) for a major program; and
         (d)   Follow up on prior SBOA audit findings, perform procedures to
assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit SBOA findings
prepared by the county department §___.500(e).
      (3)   Responsibility and authority.
         (a)   The Internal Review Division has no direct responsibility for,
or authority over any activity under review.
         (b)   Any review performed by the Internal Review Division does not
relieve the county department or Auditor employees of their assigned
responsibilities.
         (c)   The Internal Review Division is comprised of the Grant
Committee, the Grant Supervisor and the Budget Liaison Director.
            1.   The Grant Committee is comprised of three members of the Lake
County Council. Pursuant to Lake County ordinance, all county departments prior
to submission and/or award of the grant application shall schedule a meeting
with the Grant Committee in order to review previous and ongoing compliance.
            2.   Where internal control and contractual compliance is involved
with federal grants, the Grant Supervisor and Budget Liaison Director will:
               a.    Review and evaluate policies, plans and procedures, but
have no responsibility for establishing same; and
               b.    Review the existing and proposed procedures and make
recommendations and/or comments regarding acceptable standards.
      (4)   Responsibility of county department. The county department shall:
         (a)   Identify, in its accounts, all federal awards received and
expended and the federal programs under which they were received. Federal
program and award identification shall include, as applicable, the CFDA title
and number, award number and year, name of the federal agency, and name of the
pass-through entity.
         (b)   Maintain internal control over federal programs that provides
reasonable assurance that the county department is managing federal awards in
compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its federal programs.
         (c)   Comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts
or grant agreements related to each of its federal programs.
         (d)   Prepare appropriate financial statements, including the schedule
of expenditures of federal awards in accordance with §___.310.
         (e)   Ensure that the audits required by this part are properly
performed and submitted when due. When extensions to the report submission due
date required by §___.320(a) are granted by the cognizant or oversight agency
for audit, promptly notify the federal clearinghouse designated by Office of
Management and Budget and each pass-through entity providing federal awards of
the extension.
         (f)   Follow up and take corrective action on review recommendations,
including preparation of a summary schedule of prior review recommendations and
a corrective action plan in accordance with §___.315(b) and §_.315(c),
respectively.
   (B)   Independence, objectivity and ethics.
      (1)   The Internal Review Division is responsible directly to the Auditor
for the performance of internal review activities and for the reporting of
recommendations. The Internal Review Division is therefore considered to be
independent of the county departments operations being reviewed.
      (2)   Objectivity is essential to the review function. Therefore, the
Internal Review Division should not devise or install procedures that will be
later reviewed. In the installation of new systems, the Internal Review
Division can offer suggestions for minimum controls and program implementation
without impairing objectivity.
      (3)   The Internal Audit Division shall maintain high standards of
conduct, honor and character so that credibility and integrity are not open to
question. The Internal Review Division will subscribe to the Codes of
Professional Ethics and Standards as promulgated by the county's personnel and
ethics policies.
   (C)   Review planning, conduct and communication.
      (1)   The Internal Review Division shall, on a periodic basis, develop a
plan of review with respect to internal control and compliance requirements.
The annual review plan shall include identification of each review to be
conducted in terms of the financial records and activities to be reviewed.
      (2)   Reviews shall be conducted in compliance with generally accepted
government auditing standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United
States (GAGAS). These standards are contained and detailed in the Circular A-
I33, issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984, P.L. 98-502, and the
Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, P.L. 104-156. It sets forth standards for
obtaining consistency and uniformity among federal agencies for the audit of
states, local governments, and non-profit organizations expending federal
awards.
      (3)   The Internal Review Division shall notify the appropriate county
department management of the nature and purpose of the review. During the
course of the review, the Internal Review Division will inform the Auditor and
department management, to the fullest extent practicable, of any significant
recommendations.

§ 35.62 INTERNAL REVIEW SERVICES.

report. The report will communicate to county management, in a clear and
concise manner, the results of the review. The format of the report will depend
upon the type of review performed.

the animal;

tether a dog that shall weigh more than one-eighth of the animal's body weight,
or due to weight, inhibit the free movement of the animal within the area
tethered;
         (c)   By use of a choke chain or in such a manner as to cause injury,
strangulation, or entanglement of the dog on fences, trees, or other human-made
or natural obstacles;
         (d)   Whereby the animal is without access to shade when sunlight is
likely to cause overheating, or appropriate shelter to provide insulation and
protection against cold and dampness when the atmospheric temperature falls
below 40°F;
         (e)   Whereby the animal's food and water supply are not secured so
that they cannot be tipped over by the tether;
         (f)   In an open area where it can be teased by a person or in an open
area that does not provide the dog protection from attack by other animals;
         (g)   In an area where bare earth is present and no steps have been
taken to prevent the surface from becoming wet and muddy in the event of
precipitation;
         (h)   Whereby the tether is too short for the animal to move around
for the animal to urinate or defecate in a separate area from the area where it
must eat, drink, or lie down; or
         (i)   Whereby the tethering causes injury, stress, or demonstrable
socialization problems.
      (2)   Failure to provide relief to a dog in distress when exposed to any
of the conditions listed in this section is proof that the dog was unlawfully
tethered.
   (B)   An animal shall not be continuously tethered for more than one

from defending herself or from avoiding a male and an animal that has not been

§ 90.39 PIT BULLS.
   The keeper of a Pit Bull dog shall be subject to the following mandatory
requirements:
   (A)   When a Pit Bull dog is not being confined in a pen or kennel or
indoors, the dog shall be:
      (1)   Muzzled by a muzzling device sufficient to prevent the dog from
biting persons or other animals;
      (2)   Securely leashed with a leash no longer than four feet in length
and with the keeper in physical control of the leash at all times. The leash
shall be capable of restraining four times the weight of the dog with the
restraining device attached to an escape proof commercial quality walking
harness which fastens securely across the shoulders and midchest encompassing
the rib area and upper abdomen of the dog. No neck collar of any type or
material shall be used in place of a walking harness. The dogs may not be
leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings and the like; and
      (3)   If the dog bites a person or other animal, it shall be a prima
facie case that the animal was not securely muzzled and leashed.
   (B)   When a Pit Bull dog is being confined in a pen or kennel, the pen or
kennel:
      (1)   Shall be securely locked with a key or combination lock with the
key under the secured control of the keeper of the dog. If the dog is out of
the kennel and no lock is found on the kennel, it shall be a prima facie case
that the pen or kennel was not securely locked or the key was not under the
secured control of the keeper; and
      (2)   Shall have secure sides and a secure top attached to the sides and
a secure bottom or floor attached to the sides of the pen, or if the floor is
not attached to the sides, the sides of the pen shall be securely embedded in
the ground no less than two feet. All pens and kennels erected to house Pit
Bull dogs shall comply with all zoning and building regulations of the county
and shall be adequately lighted and ventilated and kept in a clean and sanitary
condition. If the dog is out of the pen or kennel and the pen or kennel is
found to be securely locked, it shall be a prima facie case that the pen or
kennel was not secure.
   (C)   (1)   When a Pit Bull dog is confined indoors:
         (a)   The dog shall not be confined on a porch, patio or in any part
of a house or structure that would allow the dog to exit the building on its
own volition; and
         (b)   The dog shall not be confined in a house or structure when the
windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle
preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
      (2)   If a dog is out of the house or structure, it shall be a prima
facie case that the dog was not restricted from those areas where the dog could
exit the building.
   (D)   A keeper of a Pit Bull dog shall within ten days of the effective date
of this chapter display a sign easily readable by the public using the words
"Beware of Dog" in a prominent place on both the premises and, if a kennel or
pen is used to confine the animal, on the pen or kennel.

of this chapter provide proof to the County Clerk of public liability insurance
in a single incident amount of $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of any
person or persons or for damage to property, including an animal, owned by any
persons which may result from the Pit Bull dog. At the time of subsequent
licensing of the Pit Bull dog, the keeper shall show proof of insurance for the
present registration period and proof that there was insurance coverage
throughout the period of the prior registration year. If the liability
insurance is canceled, lapsed, or for any other reason becomes non-enforceable,
the keeper shall be in violation of the provisions of this chapter and subject
to the penalties provided herein.
   (F)   A keeper of a Pit Bull dog shall within ten days of the effective date
of this chapter provide the County Clerk of public Identification photographs
which shall be two color photographs of the registered that are large and clear
showing the color and approximate size of the animal.
   (G)   A keeper of a Pit Bull shall within ten days of the occurrence, report
the following information in writing to the City Clerk:
      (1)   The removal from the county or death of the Pit Bull dog;
      (2)   The birth of offspring to the Pit Bull dog (male or female); and
      (3)   The new address and phone number of the keeper of the Pit Bull dog
should the keeper move within the corporate county limits or the Pit Bull dog
be sold or otherwise transferred to another keeper within the county.

periods for any other reason in the event the grantee, acting in good faith,
experiences delays; the extension shall not be unreasonably withheld. The

area may request any additional information not included in the report which
shall be provided by the grantee to the franchise area.

any delays in construction, the reason for the delay and the probable length of

   (A)   The grantee shall without charge make one aerial connection for
regular subscriber service into the internal distribution system of each
existing and future municipal office buildings, police station, fire station,
community center, library, and public and parochial schools. The grantee shall
make a connection at one outlet in each premises for the purpose of enabling
the premises to distribute the regular subscriber service. Where the premises
consists of more than one building, only one tie-in and connection shall be
made.
   (B)   The grantee shall make such tie-in and connection at the location
designated by the appropriate official at the location of the head-end of the
internal distribution system of the premises. The responsibility of the grantee
shall terminate when the tie-in and connection to the internal distribution
system is completed, and the responsibility for performance of the internal
distribution system, and for the distribution of the transmissions throughout
the system shall be solely that of the premises. The grantee makes no
representation of warranty as to the ability of the distribution system to
carry the programs transmitted over its cable system; however, the grantee will
offer, without charge, technical consulting services to the premises in order
to make the internal system work effectively for the purposes intended herein.
   (C)   The procedure for making the connections shall be as follows:
Connections will be made at the time when the grantee is serving the area
within which the premises is located. At that time, the grantee shall send
written notification of the provisions of this division to the premises.
Thereafter, upon written request from the recipient official, the grantee will
make the above-described tie-in and connection to the internal distribution
system of the premises. When the grantee is serving the area, but the building
on the premises to be connected with an aerial installation is located more
than 500 feet from the nearest CATV cable, the cost of the aerial cable
installation beyond 500 feet will be paid by the premises. For underground
installations, the grantee shall charge the recipient its actual cost. The
costs will be submitted to the premises, in writing, before installation is
begun. All the premises will be connected according to the orderly progress and
construction of the system.

that more than one franchise is issued within, or immediately adjacent to the
franchise area, and if the operating systems are contiguous and technically
compatible with the grantee, and have allocated access channels, the grantee
shall provide suitable interconnection facilities for one access channel at the
boundary of its service area. In no event, however, shall the grantee be
required to interconnect with a cable system not having substantially the same
access provisions in its franchise as contained in this franchise, unless the
system agrees voluntarily to connect with the grantee, nor shall the grantee be
required to interconnect at any point beyond any area which it has trunk or
feeder service. In no event shall interconnection be required where the
combined cable system include more than 50 trunk amplifiers in cascade or as
the state-of-the-art then permits.

line projecting upwards from the edge of the road.
   (C)   Where a mailbox is installed in the vicinity of an existing guardrail,
whenever practical, it shall be placed behind the guardrail. No mailbox will be

traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the county
roadway system. A mailbox installation that does not conform to the provisions
of this regulation is prohibited.
   (D)   All mailboxes installed after this date shall, in addition to the

(Prior Code, § 151.079) (Ord. 1628, passed 6-13-1995; Ord. 1628A-1, passed 5-
14-2007)
§ 151.080 LICENSE APPLICATION.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, any business entity
which conducts business in unincorporated Lake County, Indiana as a contractor
or specialty contractor is required to be licensed by the Board. Any business
entity which satisfies all the requirements of this subchapter shall be issued
a license by the Board.
   (B)   A business entity attempting to obtain a license as a contractor or
specialty contractor shall file a written application on forms supplied by the
Board and shall include exhibits, material, and information required and
specified on the forms. All forms are approved at the discretion of the Board
and may be updated from time-to-time with the approval of the Board.
   (C)   The application shall be filed on behalf of the business entity and
shall also contain the name of, and be signed by, the individual who manages
said business. Where a license is issued, authority to transact business
thereunder as a contractor or specialty contractor shall be limited to one
individual named in the application and the license as the license holder. In
the event the license holder leaves the business entity, the license becomes
null and void.
   (D)   All applications shall also be signed by the individual designated as
the license holder and shall be accompanied by a recommendation as to the
character and honesty of the applicant from two residents of this county who
are not related to the applicant, or in the case of a corporation, to its
officers.
   (E)   Every application shall be accompanied by two recent photographs of
the license holder (size one and one-half inch by two inches).
   (F)   Upon the filing of an application, the Board shall investigate the
information contained therein and, if any such information is found to be
untrue, may refuse to examine or license the applicant.
   (G)   Except as hereinafter provided, all applicants for a license shall
submit to and pass an oral interview and written examination. The contents of
the examination herein required shall be developed and adopted by the Board or
other independent testing agency and shall test the level of skill of the
potential license holder in the field in which the license is sought. Plumbers
who possess a valid Indiana Plumbing Contractor's License are not required to
take a written test, but must be licensed by the Board to perform work in the
unincorporated areas of Lake County, Indiana. In addition to plumbing
contractors, this also applies to other professions that are required to pass
examinations and be licensed by the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency.
   (H)   Upon receipt of application and proof of fee payment as prescribed in
this subchapter, it shall be the duty of the Board to set a date for
examination and to notify the applicant(s) in writing at least five days before
the examination.
   (I)   Any applicant who fails to qualify for a license as a contractor or
specialty contractor may be re-examined at the next succeeding date for
examinations. But, in any event, any applicant who fails to pass the written
examination on two successive attempts shall be ineligible for re-examination
for one year subsequent to the date of the last examination he or she failed to
pass.
   (J)   Before a license is issued by the Board to any applicant, I.C. 22-11-
3.1 et seq. requires the applicant to file a unified license bond with the Lake
County Recorder's Office in the amount of $5,000. The bond shall be issued by a
surety authorized to do business in Indiana and be conditional upon the
observance of the ordinances, regulations, and laws of the County of Lake and
the State of Indiana relative to contracting, building, zoning, and
construction.
   (K)   (1)   All applicants and licensees shall provide to the Board proof of
liability insurance for property damage and personal injury in the amount of
not less than $500,000 for each occurrence, or an annual umbrella policy of
$1,000,000 before a license can be issued or renewed.
      (2)   Such a certificate of insurance or insurance policy shall be filed
with the Lake County Plan Commission after the certificate of insurance or
insurance policy is filed with the Lake County Recorder in the same manner as
the county unified bond.
      (3)   If, during the term of a license, the insurance certificate or
policy expires, is revoked, rescinded, canceled, or coverage is otherwise
terminated or if the insurance company ceases doing business, goes bankrupt, is
placed in receivership or there is other reason to believe it will not be able
to meet its obligations the license for which it has been obtained shall be
deemed immediately suspended until such time as a new certificate or policy is
recorded and filed with the Plan Commission. Any applicant, licensee or license
holder who fails to notify the Board of any such problems with his or her
insurance policy, certificate, or company of which he or she is aware shall be
subject to punishment by the Board including, but not limited to, suspension,
revocation of the license, fine, permanent ineligibility for obtaining any
license from the Board.
   (L)   If an applicant fails to appear for their oral interview (after proper
notification) at two successive regularly scheduled Board meetings, his or her
application will become void. If his or her license becomes void, in order to
receive a license the applicant must apply as if he or she were making an
initial application. Under this provision, voiding an applicants license
forfeits the original application and testing fees and any passing grade
received on an examination.
   (M)   A license issued by the Board is valid until the contractor to whom
the license was issued fails to perform any work under that license for a
period of five years, in which case the license expires. If a contractor allows
his or her license to expire, he or she shall be required to apply for a new
license (as if he or she were making an initial application). Prior to the five
year period (after which a license expires), a contractor may validate his or
her license by paying all required periodic renewal fees to bring his or her
license up to date. For example, a contractor receives a license for the 1990
calendar year and does not renew his or her license after 1990. In July of 1995
the same contractor is awarded a bid for a job under the jurisdiction of this
subchapter. He or she may then renew his or her license by paying required
license fees for 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, in addition to other
provisions and requirements of this subchapter (e.g. current liability
insurance).
   (N)   If a contractor who is issued a license by the Board allows his or her
license to expire, he or she is required to apply for a new license.
   (O)   Upon receipt of an application for a license from an applicant, the
Board shall make such investigation as it deems necessary to determine the
fitness of the applicant for his or her license. In the event the Board
determines after the investigation that a question exists as to whether the
application for a license under consideration should be approved, it shall so
advise the applicant and he or she shall, thereafter, within 30 days show cause
to the Board why his or her license should be approved. The Board shall issue a
written decision after reviewing the evidence submitted by the applicant and,
if the decision is to deny the renewal, the Board shall state in the written
decision the reason(s) for denial.
   (P)   The fee for licenses shall be as follows:
      (1)   An application and processing fee of $50 and initial examination
fee of $250 shall accompany an application for any contractor or specialty
contractor license.
      (2)   If a subsequent (or second) exam is necessary because of failure of
the initial exam, an examination fee of $50 shall be required prior to
scheduling of the second examination.
      (3)   An additional fee of $100 shall be required for the initial
issuance of a license.
   (Q)   All fees assessed and collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be
paid into the Treasury of Lake County, Indiana, and shall be credited to the
County General Fund.
   (R)   All construction work in progress on the effective date of the
original passage of this subchapter shall be allowed to be completed without
the issuance of a license.
   (S)   In the event a licensee or license holder shall have been convicted of
a felony for extortion, forgery, embezzlement, or criminal conspiracy to
defraud, or other like offense indicative of dishonesty, and a duly certified
or exemplified copy of the record in the proceeding is filed with the Board,
the Board shall revoke the license.

2010)
§ 151.081 ANNUAL LICENSE RENEWAL.
   (A)   All licenses expire at midnight, December 31 of each year unless the
licensee or license holder renews the license prior to expiration and pursuant
to the terms of this subchapter.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for renewal of a license from an
applicant and upon satisfactory evidence of compliance with divisions (D) and
(E) of this section, the Director or his or her designated agent shall make
such investigation as deemed necessary to determine the fitness of the
applicant for renewal of his or her license. In the event the Director or his
or her designated agent determines, after said investigation, that the
application under consideration should be approved, the Director or his or her
designated agent shall issue a license renewal and so inform the Board.
However, in the event the Director or his or her designated agent determines,
after said investigation, that a question exists as to whether the application
for renewal should be approved, he or she shall so advise the applicant and
Board. The applicant shall, within 30 days, show cause to the Board the reason
(s) his or her license should be renewed. The Board shall issue a written
decision after reviewing the evidence submitted by the applicant and Director
or his or her designated agent and, if the decision is to deny the renewal, the
Board shall state in the written decision, the reason(s) for the denial.
   (C)   Upon receipt of an application for renewal of a license from an
applicant who, during the preceding licensed period, has been found by the
Board to have violated any of the provisions of this subchapter or any rules or
regulations promulgated by the Board, the Board shall make or direct to have
made such investigation as it deems necessary to determine the fitness of the
applicant for renewal of his or her license. In the event the Board determines
after the investigation that a question exists as to whether the application
for renewal under consideration should be approved, it shall so advise the
applicant and he or she shall, thereafter, within 30 days show cause to the
Board why his or her license should be renewed. The Board shall issue a written
decision after reviewing the evidence submitted by the applicant and, if the
decision is to deny the renewal, the Board shall state in the written decision
the reason(s) for the denial.
   (D)   Annual continuation certificates or other document(s) necessary to
maintain insurance required by this subchapter shall be filed with the Lake
County Plan Commission after the insurance is filed with the Lake County
Recorder. The continuation certificates or other documents shall be filed with
the Lake County Plan Commission in such timely manner to provide evidence
necessary for license renewals under this section of the subchapter.
   (E)   There shall be a license renewal fee of $50 and processing fee of $25
accompanying every annual license renewal application.
   (F)   No license shall be renewed during any period a licensee or license
holder is under citation by the Board for violation of any of the provisions of
this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated by the Board; however,
the Board, at its discretion, may temporarily extend the applicant's current
license for a period, or periods of time, not to exceed 30 days, or until the
violation is heard by the Board.

§ 151.083 EXCEPTIONS; EXCLUSIONS.
   This subchapter does not apply to the following:
   (A)   An authorized employee of the United States, the State of Indiana,
County of Lake, or any political subdivisions thereof, so long as the employee
does not hold himself or herself out for hire and is acting within the scope of
his or her employment;
   (B)   Public utilities, where construction, maintenance, and development
work performed by their own employees and incidental to their business;
   (C)   The owner and occupant (in the case of a new single-family dwelling
unit) when the owner-occupant is himself or herself alone constructing,
installing, altering, remodeling, repairing or building the residential unit he
or she occupies or will occupy. The term owner and occupant is intended to mean
that the individual or individuals who enter into this endeavor will reside in
the single-family dwelling unit they construct, install, alter, remodel, repair
or build. This exclusion shall only be available after the owner and occupant
files an application under §
151.080(A) through (S), the same as any business entity, except that the
required written examination under this exclusion is not required. This
exclusion shall not be available more than one time every seven years when

owner-occupant under this exclusion, but all other requirements under §
151.080, including a unified license bond, proper insurance and oral interview
are required. If any owner-occupant determines they cannot alone themselves
complete their construction, installation, alteration, remodel or repair, any
additional business entity hired to complete any portion of the construction,
installation, alteration, remodel or repair must hold a valid contractor's
license as described under this chapter.
   (D)   Any construction, alteration, improvement, or repair of improvements
located on any site and project where state and federal law supersedes this
subchapter; and
   (E)   Any individual who is employed or acts as a maintenance person as that
term is defined in this subchapter at his or her place of employment.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
§ 157.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
County Council of Lake County does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Lake County are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in bloodstains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural bloodstains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the county by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
DEFINITIONS
§ 157.015 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as ZONE A, ZONE AE, ZONES A1-A30,
ZONE AO, ZONE AH, ZONE AR and ZONE A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
   (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
   (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
   (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
   (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
   (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
   (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by pending or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.

   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards tar preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.

residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or

   HARDSHIP (as related to variance of use of this chapter). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance of
use. The Lake County Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance of use
is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic
or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance of use, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the
property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than
originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA), LETTER OF MAP REVISION
(LOMR), and LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMAs determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that
begins with the letter A is subject to the 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. See
REGULATORY FLOODS.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain

   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
county subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. TheSFHAs of Lake County
are generally identified as such on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future

installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure”provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE OF USE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. T he area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
SHADED X ZONES shown on recent FIRMS (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). UNSHADED X ZONES (C zones on older FlRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.

Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 157.030 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   lf the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   lf the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

state statutes.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.032 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of Lake County, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit
to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD
elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant's risk.
      (2)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed
structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer and
certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the floodproofing
certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected
by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit
the soundproofing certification or failure to make correction required shall be
cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation
certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future updates)
which depicts the ''as-built'' lowest floor elevation is required to be

§ 157.073 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.074 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAS, established in §
157.026, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence
in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The
floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for
construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the county shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.075 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.076 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   lf the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Once the
Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit
may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are
not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been
met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   lf the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2473, passed 3-8-2016)
§ 157.077 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMApublished map is available, shall meet general standards as
required per this subchapter.

PREFACE
Community-Based Projects Program
Ball State University
   The College of Architecture and Planning at Ball State University, since
admitting its first class in the September of 1966, has recognized its
responsibility to not only educate and train environmental professionals, but,
also provide public education and service to its constituents the citizens of
Indiana. The dual focus of education and service is the primary thrust of the
CBP Program, a multi-disciplinary activity that accommodates faculty and
students from departments of architecture, landscape architecture and urban
planning, as well as other colleges within the university.
   •   The primary goal of the CBP Program is to provide the students with a
series of viable learning experiences in problem recognition, planning and
design, citizen participation methods, etc. This goal is based on the
philosophy/assumption that a more realistic and pragmatic understanding of
these activities can best be gained by the students through their participation
in a community-based, problem focused, "hands-on" format.
   •   A second instructional goal of the program is to provide public
education in environmental planning and design to both the public and private
sectors so that they may more effectively participate in the decision-making
process that is an integral component of creative problem-solving. This goal is
based on the philosophy/assumption that an informed and educated "public" is
the key to an effective participatory format for all community planning and
development efforts. The development of communication techniques geared to
increasing public awareness and facilitating a "take part" process, is an
important part of the program.
   •   The third goal of the program is to provide a public service in the form
of technical assistance to both the public and private sectors in community
planning and design matters. This goal is based on the assumption that
responsible decisions concerning the future of Indiana's physical environment
must be based on accurate, unbiased, information and objective comparisons of
alternative strategies and proposals.
   •   A fourth goal of the program is to promote applied research activities
that focus on the widest range of Indiana's communities. This research concerns
itself with the methodologies employed in the analysis, programming, planning,
and design (synthesis) of urban and rural communities and the teaching of the
professionals who will be involved in them.
   Four points should be noted: [1] the potential of success for the planning
and design of any project or facility, as part of a larger community, is
dependent on you, as involved business leaders and citizens of Lake County,
Indiana, and not us (The Planning and Design Assistance Team); [2] we are not a
substitute for professional services; [3] the educational objectives of the CBP
Program are of primary importance; and [4] everyone in the community can
contribute in their own unique way.
   With these points in mind, and based upon evaluation of the information and
issues presented for consideration, and the levels of complexity contained
within the scope of this project, we offer the following in the hope that it
will inspire positive action for the future development of Lake County.

INTRODUCTION
REPORT SUMMARY
   The Lake County Planning and Design Studies were undertaken to explore the
issues facing Lake County and its communities and to provide a guide for local
growth management. Particular emphasis was placed on the unincorporated areas
of the county. Currently, unincorporated Lake County, facing growth pressures
from Greater Chicago, is attempting to take advantage of its opportunities
while managing change in a manner sensitive to the needs of its residents and
businesses. Lake County is blessed with strong economic driving forces and rich
natural resources aspects that are often in conflict with unmanaged
development. As the region is a strong player in the Greater Chicago area, Lake
County has traditionally been an appealing site for investment and residential
development. As growth progresses into the southern townships of Lake County,
this investment challenges the character and quality of life that many long-
term residents associate with their communities. In fact, some of this new
development reduces the character and value in itself.
   Change in Lake County finds its greatest influence in several external
forces acting on the development patterns and government policies:
Natural Environment
   The need and desire to protect nature, particularly farmland and wetlands,
and its relationship to character in the central and southern township
communities is critical in the minds of local residents. Agriculture has
traditionally shared a key role with industry in the economic vitality in Lake
County. Issues such as wildlife habitat, the preservation of open space and
outdoor recreation resources, and the scenic quality will grow in importance as
development continues.
Economic Development
   The stability and expansion of the local economy is a priority for all Lake
County residents, businesses and officials. Continued economic development for
Lake County has typically translated into continued physical development.
Concerns focus on the sensitivity of that development to local conditions and
the suitability of change with regard to local needs. Also of concern is a lack
of local consumer and business opportunity, with most commercial activity
occurring in strip development in the northern townships.
Growth Pressures
   Lake County is growing physically at a rapid pace, particularly with regard
to residential and commercial development. Due to its geographic location,
favorable tax policies and relationship with Greater Chicago, the region is
under significant pressure from sprawling subdivisions and strip commercial
development. This rapid often unmanaged growth has brought with it congestion,
stressed road systems and overburdened infrastructure, particularly stormwater
drainage systems. This rapid development has also consumed valuable open space
and farmland and threatens community character. Growth management and the tools
and development guidelines that can be employed in implementing a county-wide
growth management program, therefore, become critical issues. Development is to
be encouraged but in a manner that is sensitive to the capacity, needs and
character of local systems.
Circulation and Access
   Known as the Crossroads of America, Lake County's success and vitality can
be linked to its accessibility. Continued growth, without corresponding
infrastructure capacity enhancements has resulted in congestion and a
significant reduction in access and circulation efficiency. This directly, and
adversely, effects quality of life and business vitality. As with economic
development and growth management, it is important that a match is made between
the county's capacity, circulation/access needs and development. Parallel to
growth management and other development planning activity should be a
comprehensive infrastructure/capital facilities planning effort.
Community Quality of Life
   The examination of county patterns and trends and the local driving forces
that influence those trends can be summarized in one primary focus: community
quality of life. In particular, this relates to the maintaining and enhancement
of community character, the level and quality of services, local consumer and
business opportunities, the maintenance of pleasant living and activity spaces
in the face of mounting environmental challenges, growth pressures and
circulation problems. The community goals, therefore, can be summarized as:
growth management, preserved community character and enhanced community
identity and improved communication, cooperation and organization of local
governments.
   These goals serve to guide the planning objectives that will guide local
leaders and decision-makers in the arenas of local quality of life, land-use,
community character, housing, transportation/circulation/access,
infrastructure, the environment, economic development and community
organization. In turn these objectives translate into programs, policies,
development guidelines and action steps that serve as the future of Lake
County, its communities, citizens and businesses. This plan is designed to
serve as a tool to aid in decision-making and guide policy and action in a
manner that is both receptive to growth and development and conscious of
unique, local quality of life concerns. Several key points and observations
emerged as being key to the vitality and quality of the county and its
communities:
Key Issues and Observations
   •   Lake County contains the Calumet Region, one of the world's largest and
most important industrial centers, as well as fertile and productive
agricultural areas;
   •   The communities of northern Lake County tend to serve as bedroom
communities for those working the Greater Chicago region. This trend is
expanding to the south and east;
   •   Lake County offers investors competitive land and site development costs
as well as a favorable tax structure;
   •   Land-use controls in Lake County are based on a 1957 Zoning Ordinance
and a 1967 Comprehensive Plan (with on-going revisions to the ordinances);
   •   Housing development in the County is typically single family, detached,
low-density in character and has not typically the diversity or affordability
and other special needs of the communities.
   •   Spreading residential subdivisions are increasingly consuming prime
agricultural land, challenging environmentally sensitive areas, and placing
strains on infrastructure, circulation and support service systems and
adversely impacting community character;
   •   Development pressures have, to date, dictated capital infrastructure
improvements. A more proactive infrastructure/capital improvements program and
policies would better serve the future needs of the community, its residents,
businesses and future development;
   •   Many of Lake County's outdoor recreation areas and natural open space
systems are not protected by land-use management programs and are highly
sensitive to continuing growth pressures;
   •   The amenities of southern Lake County (scenic quality, open space,
productive agricultural land, natural systems and small town character) are
threatened by development pressures;
   •   Increased population will place greater pressure on air and water
quality, ground water systems and animal habitats;
   •   The strong identity of Lake County's communities is an important part of
community character, and should be preserved. This individual community
character also poses a challenge to addressing shared challenges and
opportunities.
Process
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
   This plan serves as a general framework for guiding the future development
of Lake County; coordinating with the individual municipalities, but focusing
its primary attention on the unincorporated areas. Provided in this plan are
recommended programs and policies for different aspects of planning and
development. Although these programs and policies have been designed based on
past and current growth trends with the interests and concerns of Lake County
residents and businesses in mind, they are not law unless adopted by the
appropriate legislative body (i.e., Lake County Plan Commission).
   Based on the profile of the county as developed from demographic trends,
past planning efforts, and citizen input, action steps have been developed as
policy guides. These steps provide an outline for the future development of
Lake County; a basis for judging individual projects and policies and evaluate
their contribution to the county as a whole. The policies suggested in the plan
are based on the goals of growth management, improved communication and
organization, and maintained community character. Objectives toward achieving
these goals are divided into land use, community character, transportation,
infrastructure, housing, economic development, environment, and communication
sections.
POTENTIAL USES
   The document is intended to both stand on its own and compliment existing
local planning materials, specifically zoning ordinances and transportation
policies. The plan can serve as a decision making tool for....
   •   Long-term Planning: Should a group, individual, or developing firm
propose a project to the Lake County Plan Commission, this document may be
referred to determine whether it and its long term effects coincide with what
Lake County and its residents have planned for the future.
   •   Setting Recommended Guidelines: With any proposed development, this
document is not intended to determine whether or not it should occur, but may
serve as a set of guidelines for ensuring that while in the development process
and once complete, it will benefit Lake County to its greatest potential.
   •   Serving as a Source of Information: When questions arise about how and
why things are (or are not) happening in and around local communities, this
document may help develop a better understanding about what the county has
planned and how those areas of concern fit into the whole picture.
   •   Improving Communication: As a source of information for residents and
businesses, the Lake County Plan may also serve as a step toward better
communication between local communities and the county. This document may then
serve as a starting point for cooperative discussion between public and private
individuals or organizations.
PREVIOUS PLANNING EFFORTS
   Adopted in the summer of 1967, the General Development Plan for Lake County
provided a broad framework for the future of this generally agricultural area.
This plan also addressed a number of issues which remain primary concerns of
Lake County residents today.
   Within the plan, a number of suggestions and predictions evolved as
anticipated. For example, the anticipated commercial development on US 30
between Merrillville and Dyer continued; however, the population projection of
850,000 people projected by 1980 only materialized to about 520,000 persons.
   Transportation was the central focus of the implementation strategy of the
1967 plan to control the impacts of commercial, industrial, and residential
development. The 1967 plan recognized increasing traffic levels on east-west
routes and reported that "if east-west traffic continues at its expected rate,
an additional expressway will be necessary to handle the growing volume." In
addition, it also exposed the "ill effects of strip highway development" to
include congestion, reduction of average speed, diminishing capacity and
safety. With this, it predicted that those most likely to succeed would feature
"close proximity to complimentary uses, improved merchandising techniques, ease
of access, adequate parking, and a pleasing appearance." Today, the more
popular developments do not necessarily have these features. The extensive use
of curb cuts causes congestion, making access to many developments difficult.
The idea of one-stop shopping is not a reality, with shoppers having to drive
to another development to comparative shop. Current parking facilities are able
to handle the number of shoppers, but use extensive amounts of open space.
While some developments are individually attractive, the lack of uniform design
throughout the corridors creates an overall unattractive appearance.
   The 1967 General Development Plan for Lake County established policies in
the areas of land use, parks and open space, transportation, commerce and
industry, coordination, and legislation. Reflected in many of these objectives
are the early signs of problems currently facing the area. Objectives such as
"encourage development...in areas...served with adequate community facilities"
and "preserve agricultural lands" stated in the 1967 plan are very much
applicable to current Lake County conditions. In general, the plan made a wide
variety of large scale predictions based on a large population increase.
However, as a population shift, rather than the large total increase that was
projected, occurred, many of the strategies and needs set forth in the plan
were grossly overestimated. In the years since, growth and development in Lake
County has been guided by the 1967 document and a series of less comprehensive
strategic plans developed by municipalities and the Northwestern Indiana
Regional Plan Commission (NIRPC). Other local planning efforts have
included....
Comprehensive Plan For Northwest Indiana
   Adopted in 1977 and prepared by the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning
Commission, this document focused around the land use patterns, housing, and
economic development for Lake and Porter Counties. Recommendations were made in
regards to these areas, as well as transportation, water quality, solid waste,
and parks and recreation. In addition, forecasts were made as to the population
and employment for these Northwest Indiana counties.
Northwestern Indiana Regional Transportation Plan
   Prepared by the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission in 1993,
this plan is a framework for the organized development of a transportation
network for Lake, Porter, and LaPorte counties. In doing this, it has paid
specific attention to the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act
as well as numerous other studies and improvement programs on main corridors in
these counties.
US-30 Subarea Study
   Adopted in 1993, this study was prepared by the Northwestern Indiana
Regional Planning Commission to address the problem of traffic congestion along
this heavily traveled route. Through various suggestions, the plan revolves
around three primary goals, to provide more efficient and safer transportation,
maintain area economic vitality, and improve the local system to better meet
the demand of internal residents.
Statement of Policy for Major Thoroughfare Development
   Prepared over fifteen years ago by the Lake County Planning Commission, this
document was the result of advice and guidance offered by the plan commission
for the development along major corridors. Included were objectives and
rationale for the development of the Indiana 55, US 41, US 30, and Indiana 2
corridors.
Lake County Parks and Recreation Open Space Master Plan
   The 1993 update of this plan builds on top of the 1988-1992 Parks Plan, and
seeks to maintain a vision for the future of Lake County's Park System. Its
predecessor addressed areas such as recreation, alternative transportation,
environmentally sensitive areas, and greenways/corridors.
Kankakee River Basin Master Plan
   Prepared for the Kankakee River Basin Commission in 1989, this plan serves
for the implementation of flood protection measures, land use alternatives, and
drainage improvements along 60 miles of the Kankakee River in Northwest
Indiana. Since the river forms the southern boundary of the county, and several
tributaries and creeks flow to it from the area, this plan was important in
guiding development in the Kankakee River Watershed of southern Lake County.
Northwest Indiana 208 Water Quality Management Plan
   In 1979 this document was instituted by the Northwestern Indiana Regional
Planning Commission as a response to the congressional mandate for the
formation of area wide treatment management plans. This plan followed those
mandates and was devoted to control all sources of water pollution for a 20
year period, and at the same time ensuring the fishability and swimmability of
all waters (where applicable).
   Following is the list of objectives outlined in the Lake County
Comprehensive Plan from 1967. Objectives marked with a plus sign have been
accomplished by the county. Objectives marked with a minus sign are those which
have not yet been met. In both cases, activities in relation to the objectives
are on-going.
General Objectives
+   Retain the county's dominant role in the northern Indiana Region.
+   Divert urban expansion from the Chicago metropolitan area to the central
and southern portions of the county.
-   Create a favorable environment for new homes, new businesses, and new
industries by encouraging development based on the neighborhood concept and
planned community unit.
-   Improve and develop the county's network of expressways and primary and
secondary thoroughfares to accommodate traffic loads and future land
development
-   Provide for expansion of community services in an economic manner to serve
existing and new development.
Land Use Objectives
-   Promote land use relationships in keeping with the development plan.
-   Encourage the orderly development of the county first in those areas that
are, or can be, served with adequate community facilities.
+   Define and establish regulations over areas of frequent flood control which
makes such land suitable only for limited development and use.
Open Space Objectives
+   Support the creation of an overall county system of parks and open space.
-   Encourage the acquisition of open space for recreation, water reservation,
and flood control as well as to add variety to the pattern of urban
development.
-   Preserve agricultural lands in keeping with the soil characteristics most
suitable for farming so that the land may provide permanent open space and
continue in its important economic role in the county.
+   Encourage the development of new housing for a wide variety of living
accommodations.
Transportation Objectives
+   Support the improvement and development of the transportation system
through advance planning at the county level and through cooperation with the
Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC).
Commerce and Industry Objectives
+   Promote the development of business and commerce to provide the greatest
convenience and service to the people of Lake County.
+   Encourage the establishment of new industries in central and southern Lake
County.
Coordination Objectives
-   Cooperate and assist local communities in the furtherance on the planning
process throughout the county.
-   Further relationships and cooperation of mutual problems between states.
Legislation Objectives
-   Study, promote, and encourage new legislation so as to provide counties
with legislative permission adequate to meet the multiple problems of modern
society and county government.

STUDY AREA PROFILE
   Lake County is located in the northwest corner of the state, in the
Chicagoland Region. The second most populous county in the state, it contains
the Calumet Region­including the Cities of Gary. Hammond, East Chicago, and
Whiting which form one of the world's largest industrial centers.
   A major catalyst for the development of Lake County was the construction of
the first railroad through the region in 1832.. Because of the railroad, access
to Lake Michigan, and its close proximity to Chicago, Lake County became a
dynamic, industrial region that rapidly developed a reputation as the "Workshop
of America."
   Lake County, however, is more than just a vast industrial region. Not far
south of the steel-making furnaces, oil refineries and chemical plants lies a
rolling, fertile, agricultural county that is experiencing tremendous growth
pressures. Located in this portion of this region are the municipalities of
Cedar Lake; Schneider; Lowell; Indiana's newest town, Winfield; and the county
seat, Crown Point. In, and around, these communities are areas that are
experiencing growth pressures from the Greater Chicago Area and northern Lake
County. Because of the dynamics of the area, and the challenges of preserving
rural character, while embracing change, Lake County must take advantage of its
challenges and opportunities in a manner sensitive to the businesses,
environment and character.
   This section of the report will include an examination of Demographics,
Development Patterns and Trends, including a Visual Profile of Lake County and
present a summary of the Community Participation that was integral to the
planning process.
STUDY AREA PROFILE - DEMOGRAPHICS
   By its dictionary definition, demographics means viewing the people. The
demographic profile of Lake County and its communities provides an indication
of patterns and trends affecting the local population. These characteristics
provide a glimpse of community needs and strengths and form a basis for the
development of planning policies for the county. The Lake County demographic
profile suggests the relationship between the expansion of the Greater Chicago
Region and development in southern townships of Lake County.

The majority of Lake County's residents live in the four northern townships
(North, Hobart, Calumet, Ross) with the three southernmost townships home to
the fewest residents. Between 1980 and 1990, however, the urbanized areas have
shown population declines while rural areas of the county have seen significant
growth. The population in the four northern townships declined by 13% (Calumet
Township declined by 20%) between 1980 and 1990. Over the same period St. John
Township experienced a 24% increase, while Winfield saw a 36% jump in
population. In addition to the internal population dynamics of Lake County,
there is also evidence that the northern townships are losing population to
other counties as well, as Lake County overall experienced a 9% decrease in
population.
Reinforcing Lake County's emerging role as a bedroom community is the 68.9% of
the population that commutes to a different community to work (and often to
shop). In fact almost 70% of those commuters traveled to Illinois for work.
This again reinforces the influence that Chicago has on Lake County.

The large "bulges" in the population pyramid above suggest that the growth
pressures being experienced in southern Lake County will have a more profound
impact on the communities in that there is a mini baby boom happening, which
suggests the short term need for additional schools and family housing. The
"bulge" at the top of the pyramid also suggests that there is a large senior
population, which typically places a high demand on public services. It can be
safely assumed that this population growth will also mean a higher than average
demand for public services and community resources. With this relatively young
and mobile population, and the current land-use distribution, traffic
congestion will also become a major factor.
   The manufacturing, retail trade and service sectors dominate the Lake County
economic profile, with 74% of the working age population. While 21% of these
workers are engaged in managerial activities, and another 32% are employed in
technical, sales and administrative support, it is important to remember that
many of these workers are commuting to Chicago for their jobs. The more local
employment tends to be in "blue collar" jobs (33%) and in the typically low
wage service sector (14% and growing).

IMAGES/0-0-0-2344.jpg]
 
   Another challenge facing Lake County is the growing unemployment rate.
Particularly hard hit were the northern townships, especially Calumet Township
(14%). The townships with the lowest unemployment rates are Hanover (4%) and
St. John (3%) Townships. While unemployment is never a positive statistic, it
is even more critical in Lake County in that many of the jobs that have been
lost are those in the steel and chemical industry, which typically pay higher
service sector jobs. This is reflected in the median household income for Lake
County of $37,517, while the northern townships household income fell to
$30,792. The household income in the unincorporated areas of the county was
$44,301, while the small towns had an average household income of $34,479.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2346.jpg]
 
   As of 1990, Lake County was home to 183,014 housing units, the vast majority
of which were located in the northern townships. The median home value for
these townships was $53,566. This compares with a Lake County average of
$68,162. The highest home values ($74,592) were found in the rapidly developing
unincorporated areas of the county and in the established suburban communities
($82,469). A large majority of Lake County's housing stock is owner occupied,
with the highest percentage of rental units being found in the developed
communities of the northern townships. Winfield Township (now mostly the
incorporated Town of Winfield) boasts the highest rate of owner-occupancy at
93%. The unincorporated portions of the county and the suburban areas
experienced the lowest rates of housing vacancy at 4% and 3%, respectively. In
contrast, the northern township communities had vacancy rates approaching 8%.

The demographic profile of Lake County highlights some of the issues facing the
area and its communities. Of particular importance is the demonstration of
population growth and pressures on the public and natural resources in the
central and southern townships. This profile also reinforces the criticality of
transportation issues as the majority of local workers and shoppers are
dependent on the automobile. These trends are not likely to ease in the near
future, and must be give serious consideration in planning the future of Lake
County.
STUDY AREA PROFILE - DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
   Over the past decade, growth and development has occurred at a rapid pace in
the unincorporated portions of the county. Residential and commercial land uses
have sprawled southward along primary routes, consuming valuable farmland and
natural amenities and altering local quality of life. In many places, this
growth has resulted in considerable stress on county-wide infrastructure,
particularly roads, sanitary sewers, and stormwater runoff systems. County
roads originally designed for rural, agricultural traffic have become congested
with commuter and commercial vehicles, while drainage ditches meant to
accommodate a handful of homes now must serve still expanding subdivisions.
Between 1982 and 1992, the number of farms in Lake County decreased by 22.5%, a
loss of 3,334 acres. A vast majority of the development that replaced them (70%
in some townships) was residential. In general, these new residents have sought
out the large lots and rural atmosphere available in the unincorporated areas
adjacent to established communities. In some locations throughout the county
these migrants face a new set of quality of life issues basements wash out due
to inadequate stormwater control systems and school buses, garbage trucks, and
emergency vehicles respond to needs slowly because of overburdened roads. They
have accepted the role of commuter, relying heavily on the automobile for
transport to work, school, or the nearest grocery or retail store. More than
any other factor, access to transportation determines the patterns of land use
in unincorporated Lake County.
   The 1967 plan observed the problems of strip retail development and
residential sprawl and encouraged planned unit residential and commercial
development. For new county residences, the plan proposed cluster subdivisions
and other techniques that would provide diversity and minimize the impact on
the natural environment. The plan also noted increasing congestion and
suggested limiting development in areas with marginal infrastructure. Despite
the 1967 directives, sprawl and strip development characterize much of Lake
County.
   Present in Lake County are four distinct "development environments." The
development environment refers to the overall conditions for growth in the area
a combination of local suitability for, and sensitivity to, development. Among
the development environment factors are natural systems (floodplains, wetlands,
woodlots), infrastructure conditions, and the scale of new growth activities.
In most of unincorporated Lake County, growth and development is rapid and
natural systems, infrastructure, and quality of life is changing. However,
within the county are four distinct geographic areas in which the natural and
infrastructure systems and driving forces of growth interact with significantly
different results.

Lake County Development Environments
Hanover, St. John, and Center Townships
   In Hanover, St. John, and Center Townships the development environment is
defined by the effects of rapid growth over the last several decades. Long the
focus of suburban growth in the county, this area has numerous subdivisions and
strip commercial centers. It is characterized by stormwater drainage problems
and road congestion that detract from the community's quality of life. Future
land use controls in this area need to focus on lessening any additional strain
on the infrastructure systems and reducing current shortcomings.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fbc54c4257c04aa304f9bec390aa74eb5a8ddf42/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2356.jpg]
 
Eagle Creek, Cedar Creek, and West Creek Townships
   Lake County's three southernmost townships have become the frontier of
suburban growth in the last decade. Developers and migrants are increasingly
looking to these areas as the central townships come to be characterized by the
very congestion from which they are seeking relief. The local development
environment is defined by open spaces, natural amenities, and a rural small
town community character that is being threatened by sprawling growth.
Infrastructure capacity, land, and scenic quality is abundant in this area and
local land use controls must focus on preserving these elements while managing
new development.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fbc54c4257c04aa304f9bec390aa74eb5a8ddf42/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2358.jpg]
 
Winfield Township (now primarily incorporated as the Town of Winfield)
   Winfield Township shares infrastructure conditions and scenic quality that
characterizes the three southern townships. However, the incorporation of the
northern two-thirds of the township as the Town of Winfield creates a unique
situation. In its attempts to balance the rural community character with
increasing development pressure, Winfield is in the process of defining itself
as a town. Land use management techniques for the new town must focus on the
balance between development and community character while providing the
economic diversity and financial stability necessary to accommodate the public
service needs of the community.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fbc54c4257c04aa304f9bec390aa74eb5a8ddf42/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2360.jpg]
 
Unincorporated Calumet Township
   In the middle of long established Hobart, Gary, Merrillville, and Griffith
lies a land area that is yet unincorporated into one of the surrounding
communities. Conditions in unincorporated Calumet Township differ from those in
the remainder of the community in that the rapid development has passed it
over. The area is bordered by Grant Street, 53rd Street, Colfax Road, and Ridge
Road. The area is bisected by a large wetland and is characterized by lower-
income households, deteriorating infrastructure, and an aging housing stock in
need of increased maintenance. Future land use programs locally need to focus

STUDY AREA PROFILE­COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
   Community participation in the planning process was encouraged through a
series of community forums. These forums, held the week of September 12 and on
10-3-1994 were designed to allow local residents the opportunity to offer input
into the planning process on the fixture of their community. Local newspapers
were used to inform residents of the township forums and solicit participation.
The residents that attended the forms included property owners, developers,
local and county officials, and interested citizens. At each forum,
participants were asked to list the strengths and weaknesses of their
townships, as well as future opportunities and threats to quality of life.
Areas with a number of social or physical problems are characterized with low
quality of life. In the community planning process it is important to address
those concerns that directly impact the area's quality of life. At some forums,
residents also developed visions for their communities and listed specific area
concerns. Many of the issues identified applied to all of Lake County, while
others were location specific.
   In the initial forums, common area threats to quality of life and
opportunities to improve that quality were based on development pressures being
faced by the region. Residents of Winfield Township in particular highly valued
their rural community character and developed a "leave us alone" stance toward
development. They feared the "city mentality" that could accompany growth.
However, opportunities for the future listed in each community were based on
the management of growth and generally include improved recreational and
educational programs, social and public services, and a pooling of local
resources. Residents generally believed that growth and development had the
potential to be either opportunities or threats based on the manner in which
they were managed.

Value of Citizen Input
   The citizen input provides a guide for policy decisions, helping to identify
strengths that can be capitalized on and weaknesses to be improved. Comments
made at the forums have their basis in issues that are significant for the
county. They also serve as an evaluation of the success or failure of past
planning efforts.

COMMUNITY GOALS

       Preservation and Enhancement of Community Character   288
COMMUNITY GOALS
   Issues concerning economic development, the environment, circulation, and
growth pressures are the most pressing issues influencing past and current
development trends in Lake County. These four driving forces, were identified
based on the county profile and its demographic trends, past planning efforts,
and participant responses at citizen forums. Because of their compelling
influence on development patterns. these four issues form the foundation of the
new plan. Indicators of the driving forces, such as the reduction in farmland
and increased traffic congestion on major routes, not only help to demonstrate
the existing conditions of the region, but also deliver some insight as to what
the future may hold for Lake County. As a whole, the comprehensive programs for
Lake County need to provide a proactive guide for change. With the driving
forces in mind, three goals were derived as a foundation for the development of
this plan....
Growth Management
   The current conditions in Lake County, particularly the growth occurring in
the rural areas, establish growth management as a key issue. Growth management
involves the guidance of change to allow for a better quality of life for Lake
County businesses and residents, as opposed to reacting to the existing driving
forces by preventing or restricting new development. Recent growth in the
unincorporated areas of Lake County has resulted in stressed public services
and infrastructure and a threatened natural environment.
   Growth management is most obviously an element of land use, but also is a
part of all policy areas, especially the environment, economic development,
infrastructure, and transportation. For the maintenance of Lake County's
quality of life, programs in each of these areas need to include realistic
techniques for growth management. In the case of land use, this would include
the establishment of development target areas for guiding development to where
it is most appropriate. Environmental policy in these target areas would be
used to protect sensitive natural features, and public service programs and
infrastructure would be developed to anticipate growth.
   Establishing growth management as a primary goal sets a basis for directing
future economic development and land use while preparing public and social
services and infrastructure to accommodate change. Growth management in Lake
County needs to be strategic as well as comprehensive in its application of
policies and programs to be best prepared for what is ahead.
Improving Communication
   Although addressed in the 1967 plan, cooperation and/or coordination between
local communities and public agencies is still a concern of many residents.
Many issues discussed at the public forums were location-specific; however,
concerns about inadequate political representation and control of decision-
making were common throughout the six townships involved. Improving
communication and organization between community leaders, residents, and public
agencies is a priority because of the potential it has for improving the
quality of life in Lake County. The key is the development of efficient
agencies and programs encouraging involvement, leadership, and cooperation
between all those affected by local or county decision-making.
Preservation and Enhancement of Community Character
   Community character can be seen most prominently in the architectural
features of the residential neighborhoods and commercial centers, as well as
with the pride and care individuals take in the communities they live in. For
example, many Lake County residents are proud of and very comfortable with
their "small town" environments. Growth pressures, economic development,
environmental issues, and circulation problems, however, have begun to threaten
the character of Lake County's communities. Preservation and enhancement of
this "small town" community identity can be achieved by encouraging new growth
to visually conform to the historical and/or rural context. Utilizing tools
such as design standards and design review, new development and modern
architectural styles can be successfully integrated into the community while
ensuring the preservation of existing character.

LAND-USE
   Land use policies and practices in Lake County have, to date, been primarily
reactive, accommodating development on an individual basis. Conservancy
districts protect lands that represent potential flood hazards, but a guide for
all land uses is needed to prevent continued unnecessary land consumption. With
the exception of unincorporated Calumet Township, the county enjoys a positive
development atmosphere developers are anxious to exploit the active markets
that exist locally. The combination of private interest and infrastructure
systems at, or near, capacity present the opportunity for greater interaction
between developers and the public sector. The result of this interaction should
be subdivisions and commercial development that both allow for return on
investment for the developers and will more adequately meet the transportation,
natural environment, and stormwater management needs of the county residents
and businesses.
   More than any other factor, land use influences the quality of life of the
communities of the county. The impact of land use patterns on community
character occur through both its location within the context of the county and
physical design at the site. The 1967 plan addressed the need to avoid strip
development and land use patterns that were incompatible with existing
infrastructure and community character. The industrial, commercial, and
residential cluster developments recommended in the previous plan are also
applicable in today's Lake County.
   Lake County has traditionally faced a unique development atmosphere due to
its relationship with Greater Chicago. There is no reason to believe that the
rapid growth trends will slow. A number of zoning ordinances and provisions
have been successfully applied with nationally in communities with situations
similar to those in Lake County.
   Any changes in local policies need to respect infrastructure capacities and
the natural environment while providing for appropriate growth and development.
In light of existing land use patterns and control methods for future changes,
the key objectives of the programs for local land use control are....
•   establishing land use patterns compatible with local natural features and
infrastructure conditions;
•   utilizing flexible, performance-based land-use control methods;
•   encouraging increased public/private cooperation in the development
process.
Objective One: Establish Sensitive Land Use Patterns
Process
   A variety of factors were used to identify the four development environments
which serve as target areas for development. The target areas are the result of
a comparison of the needs of individual development types (industrial,
residential, commercial, open space) with local features such as soils, slopes,
and road congestion. The result of the process is a geographic definition of
areas most suitable for future development.
Overlay Factors
   Factors included in the land suitability overlay process include both
existing natural features (such as floodplains or woodlots), as well as built
features (such as roads and utilities). Also significant factors in the process
were existing developments and the future open space needs described in the
1993 - 1997 Lake County Parks and Open Space Master Plan.
• Soils:
   Local soil conditions have implications for development based on their
general "build ability" and permeability. As most of unincorporated Lake County
is reliant on septic systems, the ability of soils to support those systems is
a key to development. Much of the soil in the county is poor in its ability to
support development due to high water tables and the tendency to pond. The
least appropriate soils are found in the Kankakee River outwash plain and along
major streams.
• Slope:
   The flat to gently rolling topography of Lake County prevents few hindrances
to development. However, when combined with soils information, the areas most
prone to drainage problems can be identified.
• Floodplains:
   The current Lake County zoning ordinance establishes flood zones for county.
Flooding results in significant property damage in the zone. The most
significant local floodways exist in the Kankakee River basin and along the
streams which are its tributaries.
• Wetlands:
   Construction on wetlands is prohibited by law due to the potential for the
destruction of important habitats and the disruption of natural stormwater
runoff patterns and groundwater recharge. A majority of Lake County's wetland
areas are found in the Kankakee watershed area.
• Prime Farmland:
   A vast majority of unincorporated Lake County has been designated as prime
farmland due to the same soil and slope conditions that often make it
inappropriate for development. The value of setting aside this land is based on
the value of the agricultural base to the local economy, environmental
conditions, and the visual quality that is the foundation for local small town/
rural community character.
• Vegetation:
   The woodlots that remain in the county represent important wildlife
habitats. The targeting of future land use needs to be sensitive to the
vegetation linkages and movement patterns of animals as the potential exists
for conflict with human activity. These remaining stands of vegetation also
provide the opportunity for future recreation facilities and amenities for
development.
• Transit Access:
   Numerous transit routes and corridors serve the Lake County area, with the
presence of these roads having different implications for different land uses.
Commercial and industrial sites favor readily accessible sites while
residential areas are best suited for areas with secondary routes that feed
into the primary corridors.
• Transit Capacity:
   Directly related to access is the available capacity of those routes. In
many places in Lake County, stresses on existing roads are a serious hindrance
to future development. St. John, Center, and Hanover Townships in particular
suffer from regular traffic congestion.
• Utilities:
   The restrictions imposed by utilities are also a matter of capacity. Water
and electricity are readily available throughout the county, however, the
capacity is limited by existing demand.

L.U.T.A. – Land-Use Target Areas
   The suitability overlay process identifies geographic areas with attributes
most appropriate for development. These Land-Use Target Areas serve to focus
the future development of the county. The target areas represent the most
appropriate locations sensitive to existing natural systems, road and
infrastructure capacities, and existing development patterns. All areas not
designated as target areas should be reserved for agriculture.
Note: Agriculture is a viable land use. Farm land should not be considered
"undeveloped" land.
•   Conservancy Areas:
   Conservancy target areas are based on the current floodplain zones as
described in the county ordinances and portrayed on the county map. Due to
periodic flooding, these areas are reserved for agriculture, recreation and
limited development as described by the Lake County zoning ordinance.
•   Parks and Open Space:
   These areas are similar to conservancy areas, and responsive to
recommendations made in the Parks and Open Space Master Plan.
•   Residential:
   The siting of residential areas is based on the presence of secondary access
routes, comparatively minimal limitations on infrastructure and waste
management systems, and the presence of nearby communities and sources of
employment and consumer opportunity. The residential target areas provide for
the continued subdivision of land around existing municipalities.
•   Commercial:
   Commercial areas were designated with regard to local environmental
conditions such as soils, slope, and floodplains. However, more significant
factors include the presence of complimentary residential areas or transit
routes providing high visibility and accessibility.
•   Industrial:
   Industry moving into the area would most likely be light in nature,
therefore, access to transit routes and compatible commercial areas are
significant factors.

Objective Two: Alternative Land Use Controls
Action Step
   The following action step options represent increasingly intense and
progressive land use and development management strategies. They provide
options for pro-active measures which, in many cases, are not applied
simultaneously. Each is appropriate for conditions in Lake County but differs
from the others in the scope of control placed of new development.
Option 1
   Expand the scope of residential, commercial and industrial planned unit
developments and cluster developments as provided for in the current Lake
County Zoning Ordinance. These zones could provide a basis for the
establishment of design standards on sites in the target area, while minimizing
curb cuts and limiting unnecessary land consumption.
Option 2
   Establish hobby farm overlay districts in areas zoned for agriculture. These
districts would be located around parks or nature preserves for access to
trails and large natural areas providing communal space for hobby farm owners
to ride horses, for example. Also, amend the Lake County Zoning Ordinance to
prohibit residential subdivisions in areas zoned for agriculture unless the
subdivisions are located in the hobby farm districts and meet the minimum size
requirements for hobby farms. Subdividers wishing to have a residential
subdivision in an area zoned agricultural would have two options:
1)   locate in a hobby farm district, or
2)   petition for a zone change to residential (R-1, R-2, etc.)
The purpose of the hobby farm district overlays and the limitations to
residential subdivisions in areas zoned for agriculture is to manage growth in
Lake County's agricultural areas, preserving agricultural land while still
allowing options for residential development.

   The Advantages of Land Preservation Districts
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fbc54c4257c04aa304f9bec390aa74eb5a8ddf42/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2378.jpg]
 
Option 3
   Establish land preservation districts (LPD) as overlays to existing zoning.
The land preservation is a performance-based alternative to standard
residential zoning which can also be applied to industrial or commercial
clusters. The primary purpose of the land preservation district is to encourage
development while protecting a rural, small town character. Characteristics
include....
•   requires that 75 percent of each site be used as open space - eliminates
reliance on borrowed open space (farmland, woodlots) adjacent to development;
•   includes smaller lots (typically 10,000 to 6,000 sq. ft.) grouped in
"neighborhoods" of 5 to 25 dwelling units around a common open space;
•   allows for the linkage of open spaces into a county open space system;
•   setbacks/buffers are required between neighborhoods, each other, roads, and
cropland;
•   typically requires on-site sewage treatment;
•   implementation requires in the zoning text establishing the setbacks and
open space requirements, and changes in the map designating the areas to be
over laid by the LPD.
Option 4
   Establish an adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) to limit or
restrict growth in areas with incompatible infrastructure, or infrastructure
systems at capacity. The APFO is applied as an overlay zone to areas which are
prone to congestion or inadequate stormwater management. The APFO does not ban
development, but rather requires greater private sector input into the updating
of infrastructure. For Lake County, the establishment of these overlay
districts would minimize the congestion and stormwater damage that is
characterizing the increased development
•   implementation requires the addition of appropriate text detailing the
district to the zoning ordinance, and alterations of the zoning map to include
the designated overlay areas; and
•   the process of insuring that developers satisfy the increased
infrastructure needs of the new development becomes a part of the Plan
Commission review process.
Option 5
   Establish impact zones to require private contribution to needed
infrastructure updates that result for development. While similar to an
adequate public facilities ordinance, the impact zone requires that developers
financially contribute to infrastructure updates rather than provide the
services themselves. Like APFOs, impact fees can be applied to any type of
development. Funds received are earmarked directly for the appropriate
improvements either by the county itself or a subcontractor. The impact fees
are an alternative to APFO's and are not applied together. The impact zones are
applied as overlays of existing zoning classifications.
•   implementation requires the changing of zoning ordinance text and the
establishment of geographic districts on the zoning map; and
•   the fees to be paid by the developer are established during review of the
project by the plan commission based on a pre-established fee schedule for
designated areas.
Option 6
   Establish a point system for the approval of proposed development. The
establishment of a point system allows the county to create a set of
development and design standards that govern the approval process. Each
proposed development is evaluated based on criteria such as compatibility with
existing development, compatibility with existing infrastructure, impacted
natural systems, or location in a land use target area. In a point system the
governing entity establishes a minimum number of points that must be compiled
for approval of the development. It is recommended that the minimum points be
that number equal to the value of points available minus the points to be
received from locating in a target area. This would directly encourage
development of the specified districts without making growth outside of those
areas impossible. If a development outside of a zone is able to reach the
minimum point total it has essentially recreated the conditions used to
establish the target areas.
•   implementation requires the addition of point system provisions to the
subdivision ordinance test, the establishment of criteria, and an increased
role of the Plan Commission in its evaluation of developments prior to
approval; and
•   as growth continues in Lake County, the ordinance could be changed to the
place ceilings on the maximum number of developments rather than approving all
projects achieving the minimum requirements.

Objective Three: Increased Public/Private Cooperation
Action Step 1
   Create a "one-stop development shop" as a part of the central information
center described in the organization and communication section. The facility
will provide potential developers and land owners with a guide to Land-Use
Target Areas and zoning regulations. The program could originate as a series of
articles in local newspapers and also be made available as informational
packets available through the branches of the Lake County Public Library.
Action Step 2
   Assign the role of Hearing Officer to Planning Department staff to evaluate
and resolve simple planning and zoning issues. This would reduce the time
required for development to proceed, and would relieve some of the burden on
the Plan Commission. The staff would also serve to coordinate the application
of zoning overlay zones and infrastructure policies.

COMMUNITY CHARACTER
   Lake County has undergone several significant changes during the past
decade. Many of these changes have positively enriched the balance of community
growth and development, while others represent only minimal contribution to the
quality of life of the community as a whole. Consequently, the small town
community environment, valued highly by the residents, is suffering from a loss
of character or clear identity. The once vibrant rural atmosphere, which
initially attracted residents to the county, is in many places nonexistent or
at risk of losing its appeal.
   Historic landmarks, open pastures, natural wetlands and woodlots, and
farmland all contribute to the community character of unincorporated Lake
County. Coupled with local community spirit, communication between residents,
and a strong sense of pride, monitoring and maintaining the existence of the
character displayed in Lake County is a vital necessity. Various development
procedures and guidelines can be applied toward establishing a positive growth
management plan for maintaining the character of the county's rural communities
while allowing and even encouraging community growth and development.
   Key points addressing the Lake County goals toward establishing a growth
plan reflective of maintaining community character include....
•   maintaining the identification of cultural resources
•   encouraging innovative development patterns sensitive to the rural
environment
•   establishing design review guidelines
Objective One: Identification of Rural Resources
Action Step 1
   Include an expanded environmental review by the planning staff for the plan
commission prior to development approval. A community whose development
approval process includes environmental review requires the developer to submit
an environmental impact assessment specifying the resources on the site and the
impacts of planned development on those resources. For Lake County this
assessment would include issues of community character and could be included in
a points system review process.
Action Step 2
   Develop and maintain a listing of historic sites and potential historic
landscapes and scenes. The identification of such sites can lead to the
inclusion of provisions for their protection in zoning ordinances.
Action Step 3
   Encourage community education programs sponsored by local businesses and
schools through the CIC or Lake County Public Library promoting the cultural
identity of the county and the importance of its natural, scenic, and character
resources.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2380.jpg]
 
Objective Two: Encourage Sensitive Development Patterns
Action Step 1
   Promote cluster development in coordination with land use policies. The
grouping of structures that results minimizes impacts on the land and rural
character while preserving open space.
Action Step 2
   Apply the provisions for reflective development established for housing to
all development types. New structures should reflect the architectural and
natural qualities of adjacent development, farmsteads, and residences.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2384.jpg]
 
Objective Three: Establish Design Guidelines
Action Step 1
   Develop and implement a design review procedure as an element of the
development approval process (possibly as an element of the points system).
Included as issues in the review should be building scale, building design
(architectural sensitivity), vegetative buffering, location on the site, and
character of place (response to surrounding features). The design guidelines
should be clear, concise and illustrated. Experience has shown that if given
the choice most developers will comply with design guidelines. At first the
design guidelines can be voluntary. If voluntary guidelines achieve the desired
results, there is no need to formalize them. If, however, developers and
property owners are not following the guidelines, steps should be taken to
enforce the guidelines.
Action Step 2
   Establish a signage ordinance to compliment subdivision and zoning
ordinances, or as an element of either. The ordinance will promote continuity
in design of advertising signs with regard to size, scale, character, and
overall attractiveness in its context.

HOUSING
   A majority of the development that has occurred in unincorporated portions
of Lake County over the last 10 years has been residential, including a
substantial number of large homes sited on large lots. This type of development
is land consuming and typically compromises the rural small town character that
originally made the area appealing. The sprawl and congestion, excess curb
cuts, increasing demands on services and rising costs of living associated with
increasing populations and numbers of homes were of great concern to
participants at the township forums. Many people feared the congestion that
already characterizes incorporated portions of the county.
   Another issue identified through the community forums was the lack of
quality, affordable housing, particularly in the unincorporated areas of
Calumet Township. In other parts of the county, finding housing within 80% of
median home value (the typical measure of affordability) is becoming an issue.
In some cases, the long time residents of the unincorporated townships are
experiencing difficulty with increasing building permit prices and the
availability of opportunities for first-time ownership for their grown
children. At this time it is necessary to introduce flexible provisions for
affordable housing in anticipation of growing needs. A third housing issue
present in the developing portions of the county is the contrast between newer
larger homes and the original farm houses and older subdivisions.
   The housing programs for unincorporated Lake County are based on the
objectives of....
   •   limiting sprawl and avoiding unnecessary land consumption
   •   providing diverse, affordable housing options
   •   reducing visual conflict between new and existing homes and subdivisions

Objective One: Limit Sprawl
Action Step 1
   Promote cluster developments through tax and infrastructure incentives,
encouraging builders to develop smaller lots and retaining the overall density
and character of the area.
Action Step 2
   Encourage housing agencies and developers to take advantage of established
residential target areas.
   •   utilize Land Preservation Districts
   •   enforce a points-system for grading and approving residential
development
   •   encourage diversity of siting concepts such as semi-attached, and
   •   attached units with common open spaces.
Action Step 3
   Assess new housing projects based upon infrastructure, service and school
capacity, visual character and potential for adding to road congestion. The
developer should be responsible for providing infrastructure and service
capacity they utilize.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2394.jpg]
 
Objective Two: Provide Diverse Housing Options
Action Step 1
   Perform a regular housing analysis which will address the condition,
affordability, and quality of the housing stock. The results of the housing
survey will determine the need for and extent of remedy programs.
Action Step 2
   Develop and adopt inclusionary zoning ordinances that require developers to
build a certain percentage of low-to-moderate income units as a condition of
approval. The percentage is set on a case by case basis, depending on the
current needs as revealed by the annual housing survey. The county would assume
flexibility in requiring developers to provide affordable housing on a case-by-
case basis from zero to forty percent of their proposed units.
•   requires a change in the zoning ordinance calling for the creation of
inclusionary zones and a change in the zoning map as inclusionary overlay zones
or as a conditional use.
•   alternatives:
   -   Off-Site Development: the developer is permitted to construct the lower
income units on a separate, unrelated site;
   -   Payments in Lieu of Development: the developer can make a payment to an
appropriate public or non-profit entity which will use the proceeds to further
affordable housing in some manner, in lieu of constructing any low income
units;
   -   Transfer Credit: the developer can purchase credits from other
developers who have produced an excess of affordable units;
   -   Donation of Land: the developer is permitted to donate a parcel of land
within his development to a public or nonprofit entity, on which the agency
will have the required lower-income units built.
•   prior to the preliminary approval of the development, the Plan Commission
will establish the percentage of units that should be low-to-moderate income.
If the developer has not made any provisions and construction is completed,
then the county requires that the development make a payment in lieu of
construction prior to the sale of the units.
Action Step 3
   Offer density bonuses to developers to encourage the construction of
affordable housing. The bonuses will increase the allowable density for
developers that include affordable housing in their developments.
Action Step 4
   Encourage the maintenance of the existing housing stock by offering programs
and grants to low-to-moderate income home owners for repairs and routine
maintenance. These programs will aid senior citizens and the residents of
unincorporated Calumet Township in particular in maintaining their homes and
continuing general paint-up and fix-up.
Action Step 5
   Establish a non-profit Community Development Corporation (CDC) based on the
Calumet Township residential Land-Use Target Areas (LUTA) as the facilitating
instrument for tax incentives for development, home maintenance programs, and
housing subsidies.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2396.jpg]
 
Objective Three: Reduce Visual Conflict
Action Step 1
   Include provisions in the development points system (land use) allowing the
builder to gain points for construction that follow the themes/basic
architectural characteristics of adjacent developments.
Action Step 2
   Adopt the design method termed "reflective design." The new development must
pick up on at least part of the character of the surrounding neighborhoods.
This can be a reflection of the style or exterior materials. Encouragement of
this could also be included in the points system. Developments will earn or
lose points depending on how compatible they are to the surrounding
environment, both built and natural.

TRANSPORTATION AND CORRIDORS
   Labeled the "Crossroads of America" Lake County has been experiencing
increasing volumes of vehicular traffic, particularly on the county roads in
developing areas. The increasing demands placed on the current transportation
system have resulted in a number of problems. To address these concerns, the
county must examine the broad issue of transportation, circulation and access,
in its broadest definition, and develop an integrated program which includes
public transportation, recreational opportunities, and corridor enhancement.
   The overall mission of the transportation programs is to improve
accessibility and circulation patterns through Lake County, while minimizing
the community, environmental, and social impacts that may result. This section
of the Comprehensive Plan examines Lake County's transportation routes from a
county-wide, regional perspective. In other words, unincorporated Lake County
is not the sole focus of this section. The reason for this broader perspective
is based principally on the realization that many of unincorporated Lake
County's main thoroughfares also pass through independent municipalities. Thus,
the transportation recommendations attempt to place unincorporated Lake County
in the larger regional context. Programs for improving the Lake County's
transportation system are based on the objectives of:
   •   reducing the impact on the natural environment;
   •   improving circulation and accessibility;
   •   improving character and sense of community along corridors;
   •   reducing congestion; and
   •   improving and maintaining the condition of existing roads
   Intersection of I-65 and U.S. 30

Objective One: Reduce the Impact on the Natural Environment
Action Step 1
   Increase incentives to those persons who utilize rideshare programs (such as
reducing toll rates on toll roads to higher occupancy vehicles, creating park
and ride areas at major intersections along U.S. 41 and 1-65, and creating high
occupancy vehicle lanes).
Action Step 2
   Develop new limited access corridors between targeted residential,
industrial, and commercial growth areas.
Action Step 3
   Educate residents on ways to limit auto emissions (maintain pollution
equipment, frequent tune-ups, align wheels, properly inflate tires, and car
pool).
Action Step 4
   Increase roadside vegetation and sign ordinances to improve the aesthetic
environment of the county and improve sense of community and character between
municipalities.
Action Step 5
   Preserve and develop abandoned or natural corridors into separate bikeways
to encourage bicycle use, discourage automobile travel, and reduce the impact
on the environment. Some potential sites include....
•   Erie Lackawana Railroad Corridor - Little Calumet River to Crown Point to
Lomax (41 miles);
•   Penn Central Railroad Corridor - Schererville to Crown Point to Hebron (25
miles);
•   Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Corridor - Merrillville to Malden in Porter
County (25 miles);
•   Kankakee River Wide Levees - Illinois State Line to LaPorte/Starke County
Line (60 miles); and
•   Little Calumet River Levees - Illinois State Line to Martin Luther King
Drive (20 miles).

IMAGES/0-0-0-2400.jpg]
 
Objective Two: Improve Circulation and Accessibility
Action Step 1
   Encourage the establishment of interlocal agreements and joint planning for
highways between Lake County and its cities and towns as well as with adjacent
counties. Such coordination is essential where corridors overlap both
unincorporated Lake County and independent municipalities (for example, 109th
Avenue which runs east-west through Crown Point and Winfield).
Action Step 2
Create/enhance East/West links within Lake County.
   •   upgrade 181st Avenue west of U.S. 41, link to Will County, Illinois;
   •   complete and improve 129th Avenue from Marshall Street east to Winfield,
including bridge over 1-65;
   •   upgrade/extend 153.rd Avenue corridor;
   •   upgrade 109th Avenue from Broadway east through Winfield; obtain
additional right-of-way in Winfield for future widening to three lanes;
   •   extend 133rd Avenue from State Route 55 east to Delaware Street;
   •   extend 53rd Avenue east to Taft Street;
   •   upgrade 101st Avenue from Crown Point to Winfield, including new
cloverleaf intersection at I-65.
Action Step 3
   Develop a direct route from southern Lake County into Illinois.
   •   extend/improve 109th Avenue westward into Illinois;
   •   construct a limited access expressway linking 1-394 in Illinois with
Porter County or upgrade existing state/county roads within the east-west
corridor.
Action Step 4
   Reduce traffic congestion in Lowell.
   •   connect county roads 169th, 171st, 173rd north of Lowell;
   •   utilize Belshaw Avenue as a bypass, link Clark Street to bypass;
   •   create a left turn lane on Indiana 2 in Lowell.
Action Step 5
   Coordinate abandoned rail corridors as part of the existing Bikeway Network
of Northwest Indiana and link with other Lake County recreational opportunities
and Land-Use Target Areas.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fbc54c4257c04aa304f9bec390aa74eb5a8ddf42/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2402.jpg]
 
Action Step 6
   Improve existing North/South roads in the vicinity of St. John and Illinois.
   •   pave and improve Marquette Street just outside of St. John;
   •   upgrade White Oak Avenue north of 109th;
   •   improve Cline Avenue north of State Route 8 (231);
   •   improve Calumet Avenue north of 109th.
Action Step 7
   Improve more heavily traveled roads to include a "Class II type" bikeway
(bike lane) or a "Class I" (separated bikeway) such as adjacent/abandoned rail
corridors.
Action Step 8
   Coordinate a region-wide bus service that is accessible to all major cities
and towns. Some of the participants in the system will include....
   •   Gary Public Transportation Corporation, with connecting routes in Gary,
East Chicago, and Hammond;
   •   East Chicago Bus Transit, neighborhood routes that connect with
commercial, medical, and service facilities throughout East Chicago, including
steel mills;
   •   Hammond Transit System, connect with Pace and CTA in Illinois;
   •   Hammond Yellow Coach Lines, provide taxi service to almost every city
and town in Lake County;
   •   Tri-State Coaches, provide airport bus services from Midway/O'Hare to
Hammond, Gary, and Merrillville.
Action Step 9
   Coordinate bikeways and other transportation methods with transfer stations
in existing communities, new subdivisions, and new Land-Use Target Areas,
encourage sidewalks and bike paths in new subdivisions.
Action Step 10
   Begin commuter rail service on the Amtrak Line with the location of rail
stations in Valpraiso, Hobart, and Gary and the old Seaboard System with
stations in Lowell, St. John, and Dyer.

Objective Three: Reduce Congestion
Action Step 1
   Improve at-grade railroad crossings or convert to over- and underpasses
where feasible to encourage high speed rail transit and reduce congestion.
Trouble locations include....
   •   Conrail Rail Corridor running north/south through Schneider and
Schererville and east/west through Schneider;
   •   Seaboard System Rail corridor running through Lowell, St. John, and
Dyer;
   •   Grand Trunk Western Railroad corridor running parallel with U.S. 30.
Action Step 2
   Utilize synchronized lights, eliminate access points (curb cuts), expand use
of frontage roads, limit left turns, designate truck routes, and reduce toll
rates.
   •   improve and signalize the intersection of 109th and Randolph in
Winfield.
Action Step 3
   Upgrade county roads based on designated Land-Use Target Areas to
accommodate future growth before congestion occurs.
Objective Four: Improve Character and Sense of Community Along Corridors
Action Step 1
   Use design review ordinances to encourage consistent design.
Action Step 2
   Use signage, landscaping, and icons to identify the entrance to a county,
township, community, or district.
Action Step 3
   Increase roadside vegetation and sign ordinances to improve the aesthetic
environment of the county and improve sense of character in municipalities.
Plans should include elements of
      • signage         • pedestrian setbacks
      • vehicular access      • vegetation buffers

Objective Five: Improve and Maintain the Condition of Existing Roads
Action Step 1
   Review and revise the functional classification system for roads based on
changes in land use development, traffic volumes, and roadway design in order
to obtain additional state and/or federal funding for roadway improvements.
This action step would require an up to date inventory of existing roadway
conditions throughout Lake County keeping in mind the effects that continued
urbanization, population growth and changing commuting patterns have had on the
road system. In particular, formerly rural roads which now handle more suburban
or urban commuter traffic need serious attention.
Action Step 2
   Establish an adequate public facilities ordinance for county roads requiring
the developer to make any improvements necessary to match the deficit in
roadway capacity or condition that would be caused by the new development. This
ordinance could be for all types of development or just specific categories of
development (for example, any developments which generate substantial heavy
truck traffic).
Action Step 3
   Establish transportation impact fees which would require developers to
contribute their fair share for roadway improvements that would be needed for
their development. Zone improvement districts would have to be established, and
amendments to the zoning ordinance would have to be done to meet the
requirements of the Indiana enabling legislation for impact fees.

      Infrastructure Benchmarks            340
INFRASTRUCTURE
   Infrastructure is the foundation for all development. Typically,
infrastructure is defined to include sanitary sewers, storm sewers, roads, and
utilities. For the unincorporated portions of Lake County, sanitary sewers are
the major limiting factor of development. Under conditions of rapid
development, such as those that currently exist in southern Lake County, the
provision of infrastructure has the potential to become a significant tool for
managing growth and change. Ultimately, municipalities and the county have the
ability to control the basic needs of every development­access to roads, water,
electricity, and sewage treatment. The mission of infrastructure programs is to
manage the current infrastructure system to obtain optimal results and to
efficiently provide development with working alternatives for the future that
are both environmentally, financially, and structurally sound.
   Although water and electricity consumption and road usage are also
significant infrastructure issues, they are addressed in the environment and
transportation program sections respectively. Actions steps designed to utilize
the sewage system more efficiently as a source of development controls can
likewise be applied to roads, water, and electricity.
   The programs for guiding Lake County's infrastructure are based on the
objectives of....
   •   increasing the efficiency of the sewage treatment systems; and
   •   improving stormwater management.
Objective One: Increase Sewage Treatment Efficiency
Action Step 1
   Focus the addition or sewage treatment facilities to the target zones to
encourage development in those areas and direct growth to soils capable of
sustaining sewage treatment. Roads and water and electricity supply should also
be directed in this manner.
Action Step 2
   Encourage the use of "non-traditional" methods as alternatives for sewage
treatment in areas of non-compatible soil types. Potential alternatives include
   •   flee-flow constructed wetlands;
   •   small package sewage treatment plants;
   •   clustered subsurface disposal;
   •   septic tank with effluent pumped into a constructed wetland, for further
treatment.
Action Step 3
   Include the provision or sewage treatment as an element or the points system
for development as described in land use. The appropriateness of soil types and
designs for sewage treatment would count against/for the development of
particular projects.

Objective Two: Improve Stormwater Management
Action Step 1
   Conduct an inventory and assessment of Lake County drainage systems,
establishing a framework for evaluating new developments for impact and
adjusting existing developments to minimize impact and maintain minimum
efficiency and level of service.
Action Step 2
   Increase provisions for stormwater management in areas outside designated
Land-Use Target Areas to encourage development in geographic areas of least
impact.
Action Step 3
   Encourage modifications in existing developments that are currently poorly
drained through tax incentives to operators and land owners.
Action Step 4
   Establish a set of regulations and enforcement procedures regarding
stormwater accommodation systems in new developments in the ordinances of the
county.
   •   require all drainage from developments to be of equal force as existed
prior to development;
   •   build in consideration of existing topography and drainage patterns on
the site;
   •   include original vegetation in design plans;
   •   avoid the creation of large impervious surfaces without the provision of
holding and catch basins for the increased runoff;
   •   encourage partnerships between developers and government agencies to
share costs of increased stormwater drainage capacity.
Action Step 5
   Establish an erosion minimization policy listing alternatives for stormwater
management and encouraging pro-active measures following state and federal
guidelines.
   •   coordinate educational workshops, lectures, and informational
publications with the proposed county environmental center:
   •   encourage the use of vegetation as a means of slowing down run-off and
absorbing precipitation:
   •   require on-site storage of runoff in either wet or dry ponds;
   •   use vegetated swales to control runoff while maintaining the rural
characters of the landscape:
   •   install a leak-off area adjacent to roads to temporarily store the first
1/2 hour of runoff from a storm, which contains the most toxins;
   •   include crushed stone or gravel around stormwater inlets or on banks of
drainage ditches.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
   Economic development can be defined as an active policy to retain existing
business, attract firms from other locations, and foster the creation of new
business. Truly effective economic development efforts involve a planned,
thematic approach to attract the type of development that would benefit the
community. The long term health and vitality of a community depends on the
borough analysis of that community, coupled with the development and
implementation of a strong economic development strategy. The focus of this
policy is the sustainability of development in the local economy. Rapidly
developing communities like Lake County need to seek out the type of
development that best fits the skills and talents of the local workforce, the
available and proposed infrastructure, and the desired community character.
   These concerns must be addressed in the economic development strategy to
enable a community to adjust and prosper. The basic ideas of the economic
development strategy are to create jobs for community residents, diversify and
enrich the community's economic base, enhance community character, and provide
consumer opportunity. New economic development initiatives must compliment the
existing business attraction techniques used by the Lake County Community
Development Department, the Northwest Indiana Forum, Inc., and other area
agencies of economic change.
   The economic development programs for Lake County are based on the
objectives of....
   •   establishing and managing a comprehensive and workable economic
development plan;
   •   support and encourage existing businesses;
   •   encouraging the creation of new businesses;
   •   attract compatible new businesses;
   •   encouraging the creation of businesses that are locally sustainable;
   •   developing a marketing framework based on the county's Land-Use Target
Areas.
Objective One: Establish a Comprehensive Development Plan
Action Step 1

Action Step 4
   Establish a networking system of agencies involved in public and private
financing of local community and economic development programs.
   •   pursue sources of state funding such as....
Community Focus Fund: focuses on long range community development areas such as
infrastructure, commercial revitalization, housing, and day care;
Enterprise Development Fund: revolving loan fund;
   Indiana Strategic Development Fund: encourages companies to form economic
sector based clusters by common product group or geographic region;
   •   utilize state assistance programs such as Main Street, etc.
   •   capitalize on regional and state sources of private sector financing
through private foundations and corporate giving programs
Objective Two: Encourage New Businesses
Action Step 1
   Establish a business support center as an element of the Lake County Central
Information Center responsible for providing new businesses with technical and
financial support.
Action Step 2
   Establish job training programs through the business support center that
give local workers the skills to work in the new businesses.
Action Step 3

Objective Three: Encourage Reinvestment in Existing Businesses
Action Step 1
   Prepare an annual survey of the needs of existing businesses (i.e., cultural
activities, particular labor force skills, printing services, etc.) to direct
development strategies and encourage discussion of community/business
relationships and needs.
Action Step 2
   Include programs for supporting existing businesses at the Central
Information Centers Business Support Center. Programs would focus on locating
sources of funding for expansion and reinvestment.
Action Step 3
   Encourage the development of public private partnerships between the
agencies, and the businesses in the county that would establish a commitment to
the community from the business and a commitment to the business from the
community.

ENVIRONMENT
   In Lake County, several issues are at the heart of environmental programs
and policies. Information and resources about the environment are not easily
accessible resulting in a lack of awareness and poor education about local
environmental issues. Important and valued physical features are threatened by
rapid growth and development as activities such as construction,
transportation, and manufacturing are having dramatic effects on local
environment conditions. The growth in population and development has put added
strain on the environmental quality of the county as a whole.
   Protecting and caring for the environment involves not only reacting to
problems as they develop, but taking pro-active measures to prevent problems
from occurring. The environment is very sensitive to human influence,
therefore, creating and maintaining a quality environment requires knowledge,
cooperation, and education. Lake County's officials, representatives, and
residents need to be empowered to improve the quality of their environment and
the quality of their lives.
   The programs for Lake County's environment are based on the objectives
of....
   •   increasing awareness of environmental issues;
   •   increasing energy efficiency and demand-side alternatives;
   •   providing incentives for participation in conservation programs;
   •   guiding land use in an environmentally sensitive manner;
   •   providing activities to educate all age groups about environmental
issues;
   •   increasing awareness of recycling and alternative methods of waste
disposal;
   •   minimizing the impact of new development;
   •   coordinating governmental approaches to environmental quality.

Objective One: Increase Awareness of Environmental Issues
Action Step 1
   Create a Lake County Environmental Canter as a partnership between the
Planning Department. Community Development Department, the county school
corporations, and Cooperative Extension Office. Local utility companies and
industries could be approached for financial support.
   •   include a display of flyers on different environmental issues and
activities such as how to compost, dispose of toxic wastes, weatherize the
home, and evaluate the effects of herbicides and pesticides on water quality,
etc;
   •   provide a weekly newspaper column and/or monthly newsletter;
   •   create a community bulletin board in which programs and activities can
be displayed. This could be located outside the environmental center, with the
assumption that other means of advertising such as television ads, newsletters,
flyers, electronic bulletin boards, and newspaper ads would be used;
   •   organize lectures, workshops, and demonstrations given by qualified
individuals to provide more in-depth education about the environment.
   •   develop demonstration projects using "best practices" for
environmentally sensitive development, procedures, etc. These can be with local
businesses, industries, farms and/or homes.
Action Step 2
   Create a county sponsored and supported Arbor Day program possibly
coordinated by the environmental center during which residents would plant
trees throughout their communities. This can be coordinated with the help of
the National Arbor Day Foundation and other groups.
Action Step 3
   Create monthly Tox-Away Days during which citizens can bring household toxic
materials to a handling/separation/processing center so they can be disposed of
properly. One such location could be the local fire departments and could be
coordinated with materials safety programs.
Action Step 4
   Provide free, or "at cost" compost bins to residents of Lake County in order
to increase awareness and participation in composting programs.
Objective Two: Energy and Environmental Efficiency and Sensitivity
Action Step 1
   Provide and distribute energy-saving devices, such as hot water heater
insulation, window caulking, and compact fluorescent light bulbs with the
cooperation of local hardware stores, NIPSCO, and general contractors.
Action Step 2
   Establish home weatherization workshops to educate residents on how to make
their homes, both inside and outside, more energy efficient. Workshops would be
held biannually, once for the winter months and again for the summer months.
Action Step 3
   Initiate load management/Time-of-Use programs to be coordinated and
administered by NIPSCO. Such programs include the use of switches to control
energy consumption in large areas and the application of alternative rates for
those who use the bulk of their daily energy consumption at off-peak hours.
Action Step 4
   Offer incentives for the replacement or improvement of high energy-consuming
appliances, such as refrigerators and water heaters. Possibilities include
rebates for purchasing new appliances and improvement materials (i.e.,
insulation) and free disposal of old, less efficient appliances.
Action Step 5
   Establish a tree planting program to educate residents about the energy-
saving benefits of planting the right types of trees in the right places and
improve the aesthetics of the participating businesses, homes and communities.
Action Step 6
   Develop a county-wide composting program. This program should encourage
household composting, but curbside pickup of yard waste could increase the
participation in the program. Special composting "trash" bags should be
distributed to facilitate the program. Educational programs should also be
developed to encourage participation.
Objective Three: Encourage Participation in Environmental Programs
Action Step 1
   Develop and implement a Lake County Environment Awards program (possibly
including tax incentives) to those businesses and industries that make an
effort to improve and/or protect the environment. Requirements for receiving a
Lake County Environmental Award may include....
   •   certain percent energy consumption reduction or demand-side management
program:
   •   use of alternative energy sources;
   •   effective carpool programs for employees;
   •   alternative waste management/recycling programs;
   •   offer rebate programs or other special offers for environmentally-
sensitive items and/or procedures;
   •   sponsoring lectures, workshops, and demonstrations through the
environmental center;
   •   making community donations (i.e., money and services).
Action Step 2
   Provide resident Lake County Environmental Awards for citizens taking an
active role in protecting/improving the environment. Eligibility for such
awards may be achieved by
   •   volunteering at the environmental center;
   •   participating in environmental programs (i.e., tree planting);
   •   certain percent energy consumption reduction;
   •   use of alternative energy sources;
   •   composting yard/kitchen waste;
   •   carpooling to work, school, etc...
Objective Four: Environmentally Sensitive Land-Use and Development
Action Step 1
   Develop and implement a program to increase the awareness of the
possibilities of conservation easements. The conditions of the easement are
written in the deed of the property, therefore providing permanent protection
of the land. Owners may decide to continue farming their property, allow the
harvesting of firewood, or even build a house on it, while possibly receiving
tax incentives for their environmental allowances.
Action Step 2
   Encourage local citizen groups to establish land trusts in the effort to
protect productive farmland, open space, recreational resources, etc. Lake
County could contribute to a project of this type by purchasing the land and
transferring the ownership to the land trust organization.
Action Step 3
   Provide forestry assistance for woodland owners. At times in cooperation
with the County Extension Service, this type of program is designed to provide
management assistance to private foresters, such as technical information,
alternative forestry practice, and advice about maintaining and regenerating a
woodlot, fence rows, wildlife habitat improvement, recreational uses,
harvesting, and marketing. Field demonstrations, workshops, and other programs
may be included as part of the County Environmental Center.
Action Step 4
   Provide programs offering education and demonstrations on alternative
agriculture practices. Farmers taking advantage of such alternatives as contour
farming, no-till farming, and/or not using hazardous pesticides and herbicides
may be offered tax credits or other incentives. A program of demonstration
projects could be established in cooperation with the Cooperative Extension
Service, Farm Bureau, FFA, or other local groups.
Action Step 5
   Require environmental impact assessments for proposed development projects
providing an overview of the potential environmental hazards associated with
various developments in the county.
Objective Five: Provide Education on Critical Environmental Issues
Action Step 1
   Develop environmental labs in schools in which students could receive hands-
on participation concerning environmental issues. The lab would demonstrate the
importance of environmental issues, how they are affected by each person, how
to manage solutions­proactively and reactively.
Action Step 2
   Create recycling contests between schools, neighborhoods, and/or communities
providing rewards for recycling and making recycling more socially acceptable.
Action Step 3
   Create a smart shopper program to create awareness among shoppers of the
waste problems within the county and provide residents with the opportunity to
make conscious choices of which brands to purchase.
Action Step 4
   Create a booklet of environmental resources that offers teachers a wide
range of ideas on what to teach in the classroom. The booklet could have ideas
on how to create bulletin boards, student activities, and environmental fairs.
The booklet should be updated periodically and made available to schools,
organizations, and individuals.
   A parallel educational program could be developed for the community at
large. Newspapers, cable television, etc., can be used to help distribute
information about programs and environmental sensitivity.
Action Step 5
   Implement an educational program to increase the awareness of farmers about
the use of pesticides/herbicides and their effects on water. Alternative
farming techniques, the proper use of chemicals, pest resistance crop
varieties, and different types of companion plants should be included in this
program. Demonstration projects should also be established in cooperation with
the Cooperative Extension Service and the Farm Bureau. FFA and similar
organizations should also be actively involved in such programs.
Objective Six: Alternative Methods of Waste Disposal
Action Step 1
   Combine existing recycling programs to generate a new county wide recycling
program. In areas where curbside pick up is not feasible, this program could be
implemented by placing collection bins in a centralized location (possibly the
local schools, grocery stores, etc.) in each community so citizens could
deposit their recyclable materials.
Action Step 2
   Create one centrally located separation center where all community
recyclables would be taken. The materials would then be sorted, processed, and
transported to the proper distribution companies. Coordination with a trucking
company or the trash service could be utilized to transport materials to the
separation center and distribution companies.
Action Step 3
   Create a smart shopper program to help residents reduce the waste stream by
buying products that are packaged more efficiently. A supermarket (or other
high visibility/high use business) could be encouraged to volunteer to
implement the program, and be the model store for the county. Categories should
be developed to determine which type of products should be emphasized. These
categories of products to be emphasized would include least-waste packaging and
recyclable products. Flyers, labels, and brochures would be printed that would
point out these products to residents.
Action Step 4
   Establish workshops to encourage individual residents to compost. The
compost they produce could be used around their home for gardening purposes and
mulching; reducing the waste stream. This program could be augmented by county
maintenance crews providing mulch from "chipped" tree branches, etc.
Action Step 5
   Establish a program where citizens would donate their time and tools to an
equipment lending program. The program could be handled through a community
facility like a library or community center. The tools could be checked out for
a period of time, and fees assessed if a tool is returned late or damaged. The
fees could be used to purchase new tools to add to the collection.
Objective Seven: Reduce Impact of New Development
Action Step 1
   Encourage the individual testing of wells. A list of sources where residents
can send their water samples should be provided to residents. To the extent
possible county support should be provided for this service to encourage
participation.
Action Step 2
   Implement regular ditch maintenance programs that would free all drainage
channels of obstructions (i.e., grass clippings, leaves, etc.) and construct
additional drainage channels to help provide additional drainage to flood prone
areas.
Action Step 3
   Establish standards that would require developers/contractors to use
appropriate erosion control practices and drainage management systems to
minimize drainage and other environmental problems. Such standards could
include temporary runoff diversion, grading plans that coincide with the 208
Water Quality Study, and encouraging developers to work with the physical
characteristics of the site.
Action Step 4
   Amend the zoning ordinance so as to create policies that increase energy
efficiency through the placement and design of new developments. The policies
should include such techniques as encouraging mixed-use development, creating
higher densities in new development, orientating the buildings on the lot so as
to maximize southern exposure, and preserving clusters of trees and open space
by clustering development.
Action Step 5
   Develop and implement programs that would encourage residents to carpool.
   •   on certain days, only residents with even number license plates can
drive while on the other days, only residents with odd number license plates
can drive;
   •   establish commuter lanes;
   •   establish mandatory inspections for emission control.
Objective Eight: Intergovernmental Coordination
Action Step 1
   Encourage participation in developing and implementing environmental
actions, activities and policies by ail communities in Lake County. Positive
impacts on the community are magnified by expanding the resources put into the
recommendations.
Action Step 2
   Coordinate strategies, actions, programs and policies used in Lake County
into the neighboring counties of Porter and LaPorte and Illinois and vice
versa. NIRPC should be called on to provide advice, assistance, and resources
to improve the environment of Northwest Indiana.

COMMUNICATION AND ORGANIZATION
   Communication and organization amongst the stakeholders in the
community­residents, leaders, and public, private, and non-profit agencies­is
of increasing importance in the so called "information age." While in the past
more physical factors such as location, access, and natural resources were of
primary significance, trends now point to communication as key to growth,
development and quality of life. The major issues facing the county in terms of
communication are the efficiency of agencies and programs, the specific roles
for governmental agencies and community organizations, and community advocacy.
   In the case of Lake County, communication and organization programs include
both information management and the building of partnerships. Efficient
information management requires the creation of a "hub" of data from all
portions and aspects of the county. The purposes of this hub would be to
encourage information sharing and informed decision making. The building
partnerships aspect focuses on bringing area residents together to discuss
"community" and to formulate ideas and goals for the future.
   The programs for improving organization and communication in Lake County are
based on the key objectives of....
   •   increasing the efficiency with which information is managed;
   •   improving local leadership;
   •   encouraging multi-community collaborations.
Objective One: Information Management
Action Step
   Establish and maintain a Lake County Central Information Center (CIC) to
expand the quantity and quality of information readily available, allow for
more efficient transfer of information, and foster citizen and inter-agency
awareness. The CIC will be responsible for the maintenance of a series of
annually updated resource guides in the areas of human services, amenities, and
government directories. The CIC will also become the organizational base of
environmental programs, economic development activities, and land-use
management.
   •    alternative structures....
   New agency: establish an agency specifically assigned with information
collection, organization, management and distribution;
   Expansion: increase the role of an existing facility, such as the Lake
County Library, or other county agency
   •   the importance of the new center lies in the ability to efficiently
direct individuals and other agencies to needed information. This could also be
accomplished through the development of a reference/directory section at the
county library with subdivisions at the appropriate county agencies.

Objective Two: Leadership Training
Action Step 1
   Establish a series of leadership training workshops to educate local leaders
and activists on efficient representation and interaction with other
individuals and agencies. Some benefits of the workshops should include
   •   the development of leadership skills for current and future leaders:
   •   the creation of advocates for certain policies:
   •   the improvement of leadership in all aspects of the community (business,
civic, government, religious, and social);
   •   the improvement of communication between residents and county policy
makers.

Objective Three: Multi-Community Collaboration
Action Step 1
   Establish a framework for inter-governmental cooperation, evolving to
intergovernmental coordination, to more clearly define the roles and
interactions of government agencies and programs and encourage the more
efficient use of county resources.
   •   Intergovernmental cooperation options...
   County Administrator: The county administrator would be the facilitator of
programs and policies, taking care of the day to day business of the county and
making sure that the decisions for the county are carried out in the most
efficient way. The administrator would have an advisory role to each county
agency and municipality, providing technical support and organizational
council. The administrator would also coordinate the continued updating of the
strategic plan.
   Circuit Riding Planner: The creation of a county circuit-riding planner is
similar in function to the county administrator option with the exception that
the circuit rider position would be within the planning department. The planner
would be working for each of the communities in the county on a rotating basis,
consulting on local issues, providing technical assistance, and coordinating
activities between different groups who are working toward the same goal.
   •   Intergovernmental collaboration options...
   Council of Governments: Municipalities in Lake County, as well as county
agencies develop a structure for discussing community issues and developing and
monitoring policies to resolve county-wide issues.
   Regional Districts: A group of communities creates one new governmental
structure to govern one specific issue of the combined area (for example, a
regional water district, regional transportation authority, etc.).
Action Step 2
   Encourage the inclusion of non-profit and private groups in the structure of
intergovernmental collaboration and coordination through consultation and
referrals by the circuit-riding planner or county administrator.

THE NEAR FUTURE
THE NEAR FUTURE
   The future of Lake County hinges strongly on its ability to adapt to the
existing trends with which it is faced. The recommendations included in this
document serve as an aid to the county during this process. Therefore, within
the next five to ten years, the county should see alterations of policies that
will affect primarily the future physical development, intergovernmental
communication, and citizen behaviors for the purpose of improving the quality
of life in Lake County.
Physical Development
   Perhaps most important in the planning of the future of Lake County will be
its ability to adapt to existing development pressures. Crucial to this
planning will be the county's ability to focus development within the
designated Land-Use Target Areas. The first indication of this process should
be changes in the zoning ordinance and land use plan to reflect the desired
development types. Marketing also should have begun to encourage these
locations as the primary sites for development. Development under the new
programs and geographic areas should be well under way within ten years. At the
same time, the county should have sought out alternative sources of funding and
operating infrastructure systems and other capital projects. One source of
financing these improvements should be the requiring of the creation of impact
statements and the dedication of private funds for public facilities
improvements. Alternative programs for accommodating solid waste and increased
traffic flows should also have gained momentum. One important alternative
available to residents at this stage should be a county wide bus system linking
the various rural communities with the northern portion of the county, Greater
Chicago, and the land use target areas. Design review should be playing an
increasing role in the development approval and permit process with increased
land use compatibility and aesthetic quality as the result. In addition, the
first inventories of rural, scenic, and historic value, as well as housing
conditions should have been performed providing a basis for further growth
management and community character preservation.
   In the near future special attention should be paid to two particular
geographic areas within the county. The first area is unincorporated Calumet
where social and development environment conditions differ from those in the
remainder of the county. As the urban problems facing this area demand special
attention, the formation of a local non-profit community development
corporation is the most likely first step in planning efforts. Within ten
years, the CDC should be seeking out financing for infill development and
organizing local clean up and home maintenance programs for area residents. The
new town of Winfield will also undergo significant changes as it adopts its own
comprehensive plan, zoning ordinances, and strategies for community
development.
Intergovernmental Communication
   In addition to the increased coordination of physical development process
the agencies of the county will be acting on the realized need for improved
interaction and communication. This should begin through the designation of a
central information center for the collection of county-wide data. The center
will be in its early stages of development, most probably a display area and
pamphlet section at the Lake County Public Library and its branches.
Citizen Behaviors
   The adaptation of some of the behavior patterns of the county residents as a
whole should also be very significant in the near future. The environmental
center, central information center, and one stop development center should play
important roles in the lives of citizens as the development process changes,
environmental concerns grow, and the need for immediate answers to concerns
becomes more pressing. Recycling, reducing, and reusing programs, as well as
those of public transportation should grow in usage and application to the
county's conditions.
(Prior Code, Comprehensive Plan)
APPENDIX A: PUBLIC FINANCING
FINANCING
   An important aspect of community planning and service is the acquisition of
funding or other resources of project implementation. This section of the
report describes some of the state supported programs available to communities.
   This is a very limited list, and should be used only as a preliminary guide
to some of the financial options available. The programs described here
include...
   •   Community Planning Fund (CPF)
   •   Community Development Action Grant (CDAG)
   •   Special Improvement Districts (SID)
   •   Economic Improvement Districts (EID)
   •   Tax Increment Finance (TIF) Districts
   •   Sales Tax Increment Finance (STIF) Districts
   •   General Obligation Bonds
   •   Tax Revenue Notes
   •   The Barrett Law
   •   Cumulative Capital Development Funds (CCDF)
   •   Economic Development Income Tax (EDIT)
   •   County Option Income Tax (COIT)
   •   County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT)
   •   Impact Fees
Community Planning Fund
   The Community Planning Fund (CPF) Planning Grant from the Indiana Department
of Commerce is intended to help areas which want to focus on community-based
planning. This grant money could help to expand the scope of these
recommendations, if there is one area of interest which deserves a more in
depth view. Like most grants offered by IDOC, it helps if the focus area is
either socially or economically distressed (or both). Any county, incorporated
city or town, or a not-for-profit organization is eligible to apply for this
grant. Based on a one-to-one match (which means that for every dollar of grant
money the applicant must provide one dollar of local support) the CPF applicant
may request up to $10,000 or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is less.
   To make this process easier, IDOC provides a number of grant workshops and
seminars which focus on how to fill out the applications. Also, a Community
Development Field Staff person is on hand to answer any questions which might
arise in any part of the process. That person can be reached at (219) 881-6711.
There are also several pre-determined projects which IDOC generally funds and
they are as follows:
   •   market studies targeting specific geographic areas, industries, or
workforce segments;
   •   site or area redevelopment and feasibility studies;
   •   development strategies (i.e. for small business, industry, real estate,
housing, Main Street revitalization, or tourism);
   •   strategic/comprehensive development studies;
   •   targeted and comprehensive land-use planning studies;
   •   engineering studies for water, wastewater and solid waste treatment
systems;
   •   other community-economic development planning not fundable through other
state sponsored planning programs.
Community Development Action Grant
   A Community Development Action Grant (CDAG) from the Indiana Department of
Commerce assists communities when they are ready to start development or soon
after. The basis of this particular grant program is to support the
administration and/or program development of not-for-profits (i.e. Community
Development Corporations) or multi-organizational alliances (such as the one
proposed in this document).
   Because the expenses targeted with this particular grant are usually much
higher than those targeted with the CPF, the CDAG applicant may request up to
$50,000 or one-third of eligible cost, whichever is less. Also, because this
grant is administered by IDOC, the same types of workshops and seminars are
available.
   To help foster any ideas about what this money could be applied for, IDOC
has provided that the following activities would usually be eligible CDAG
projects:
   •   micro-enterprise/small business development technical assistance
programs targeting disadvantaged business owners or business districts:
   •   leadership/stewardship or technical training for board members staff,
residents and/or elected officials:
   •   rural community development corporations supporting socioeconomic
renewal programs:
   •   business training for at-risk youth;
   •   community land trusts;
   •   community organizing for the purposes of community education and
relationship-building leading to greater collective and personal power in the
community;
   •   comprehensive downtown or neighborhood development programs;
   •   redevelopment commissions.
   Special Improvement Districts, or SIDs, were established under I.C. 36-7-21.
The specific formation of these districts come from approval of the local
legislative body upon request of an established Redevelopment Commission (see
Appendix). These districts are set up strictly for the redevelopment of an
area; which will then benefit the property owners in the SID. These districts
must, however, be set up according to the procedures for the formation of a Tax
Increment Allocation Area (see Appendix).
   Once established, the governmental unit may assess individual property taxes
as they see fit. This assessment, however, must be based on the property
owner's direct benefit of the improvement. In addition, the established
Redevelopment Commission may issue notes and/or bonds which will be payable
from the assessments made on the individual property owners. (Please note that
a Redevelopment Commission is required for the development of a Special
Improvement District, and if one does not exist, then one must be formed).
Economic Improvement District
   Unlike Special Improvement Districts, does not rely on the existence of a
Redevelopment Commission. Rather, an Economic Improvement Board must be
established. This board usually consists of three members who are appointed by
the governmental unit. At least two of these board members must own real
property within the proposed EID. Once established, a special tax assessment
within the district can provide for any number of economic development
projects.
   Similar to the SID, the Economic Improvement District tax assessment must
show direct benefit to the assessed property owner. Upon assessment, the
acquired funds are then paid into the Economic Improvement Fund; whereas, the
board may only use these monies for the specified purposes in the establishing
ordinance. The Economic Improvement Board, however, may not issue notes or
bonds which are backed by the money in the fund.
Tax Increment Finance
   In general, Tax Increment Finance (TIF) districts provide for the temporary
allocation of money to designated redevelopment districts. These monies come
from the increased tax proceeds from this district, which are generated by the
increases in the district's assessed valuation due to the initial redevelopment
investment. In short, TIF districts permit municipalities to use increased tax
revenues, which are stimulated by redevelopment, to pay for the capital
improvements needed to induce the redevelopment. (Please note that as with
SIDs, the formation of a Redevelopment Commission will be required for the
usage of a Tax Increment Finance district).
   The designated area, an allocation area, does not require the finding of
blight, but the area must provide evidence of new job opportunities. Property
assessment are froze at pre-development level, in the allocation area.
Municipal bonds are then issued to finance a portion of the redevelopment. As
property values, and assessments, in the allocation area increase, the
municipality uses the "increment" in tax revenues to meet debt service on
issued bonds. TIF districts are highly flexible because no petition approval is
necessary (unless other "special" taxes are to be levied as well), there is
local control, and no debt limitation applies (unless other "special" taxes are
to be levied, in which case the debt limit, by statute, is 2% of the net
assessed valuation). TIF district monies are commonly, and most easily
allocated, for infrastructure improvements; although, infrastructure
improvements are not the only possibility for such monies.
Sales Tax Increment Finance
   The purpose of establishing a Sales Tax Increment Finance (STIF) district is
to provide municipalities with a means of financing local public improvements
needed in connection with retail projects that would hopefully generate a
significant amount of sales tax to pay for the improvements. STIF districts
work just like TIF districts, but rather the "increment" in sales taxes, rather
than property taxes, would be used. In other words, all of the increased sales
taxes generated in the district would be used to pay for the bonds or notes
issued which paid for the initial improvements.
   The original version of this piece of legislation was repealed, but the
overall concept intrigued many local governments and was later adopted as I.C.
36-7-26. This code was established for a trial community (Hammond) to set up an
economic development project district, and use the STIF ideals. In order to
establish this type of district, a municipality would follow the same
guidelines for declaring an area blighted but an additional requirement, of
getting approval from the State Board of Finance, was added. The fundamentals
for the formation of a STIF district lies in the fact that the established
Redevelopment Commission must be able to prove that the district has....
   •   attracted new business enterprises and/or retained or expanded existing
businesses in the district;
   •   benefitted the public health and welfare by serving as a public utility
or benefit;
   •   protected and increased state and local tax bases or revenues;
   •   resulted in a substantial increase in temporary and/or permanent job
opportunities and private sector investment.
General Obligation Bonds
   The issuance of general obligation bonds is an option to any municipality
for the funding of public improvements. In general, general obligation bonds
are a form of public debt which are payable out of ad valorem taxes (or taxes
which are based on the price of goods) levied and collected on all of the
taxable property located within the proposed redevelopment area. These bonds,
however, are subject to state statute and must be administered carefully. The
following requirements must be satisfied before the issuance of any general
obligation bond:
   •   the total indebtedness of the municipality (including the proposed
general obligation bonds) may not exceed 2% of the net assessed valuation of
taxable property. This is based on the last complete and final assessment for
the municipality;
   •   the issuance of these GO bonds is completely subject to a petition/
remonstrance process;
   •   the whole process is also subject to approval from the State Board of
Tax Commissioners;
   •   general obligation bonds usually must be sold at public sale.
Tax Revenue Notes
   Rather than issuing general obligation bonds, cities, towns, or counties may
opt for the issuance of the revenue notes (which are repayable in five years).
Just like GO bonds, these tax revenue notes may be used for a wide variety of
public improvement projects (so long as it's for a valid public purpose). There
is, however, a limit to how much money can be raised by the issuance of such
notes and the general rule is usually 5% of the municipality's total tax levy
for the current year.
   Although this limit to the amount may discourage some municipalities from
issuing tax notes, the fact that there is not petitioning/remonstrating process
or because they are not subject to the State Board of Tax Commissioners, makes
the use of this option a lot more popular than that of issuing general
obligation bonds.
The Barrett Law
   The Indiana Barrett Law, as provided by IC 36-9-18, allows municipalities to
construct or repair infrastructure by assessing only those landowners who
directly benefit from the improvements. The legality of the Barrett Law lies in
the fact that the municipality which uses this option holds a lien against each
individual property owner and may foreclose on any individual who defaults on
their payment. In order to assist in the actual improvements, the municipality
may issue notes or bonds in anticipation of the collection of the tax revenue.
   Each individual property owner, however, has two chances to remonstrate
against this action. First they may remonstrate against the initial decision to
make these improvements and the amount to be charged to "benefitting"
landowners. Secondly, they may remonstrate against the specific amount being
charged to them. Although it is a fair way to raise money to make needed
improvements, the Barrett Law is not the most preferred method.
Cumulative Capital Development Funds
   If the project which needs funding is for infrastructure or parks and
recreation facilities, municipalities have another option by using Cumulative
Capital Development Funds (CCDF). A CCDF, which is a special tax rate, can be
established for a period up to three years, and may thereafter be reestablished
every three years. The establishment and/or reestablishment does, however,
require public hearings as well as approval from the State Board of Tax
Commissioners. (Please note that if the proposed taxing district has more than
50 objecting petitioners, the State Board of Tax Commissioners will, more than
likely, hold special hearing specifically for the objections).
   The basis behind what rate the municipality may charge for this special tax
lies in whether or not the county is an adopting county and the time period
they have had the CCDF in effect. The term "adopting county" refers to whether
or not the county has adopted either the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax
(CAGIT) or the County Option Income Tax (COIT).
Economic Development Income Tax
   The Economic Development Income Tax (EDIT) may be imposed by the county
income tax council by passing an ordinance which imposes EDIT. The formalities
behind this ordinance (see the Appendix) lies public hearings and a majority
vote by the county income tax council. There are also certain restrictions to
how much the tax rate can increase. EDIT may be imposed at the rate of 0.1%,
0.2 %, 0.25% 0.3%, 0.35%. 0.4%, 0.45%, or 0.5% on the adjusted gross income of
county taxpayers.
   One thing that needs to be kept in mind are the two other county income
taxes available to counties. These are the County Option Income Tax (COIT) and
the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT). This is important because if
another one of these county income taxes are imposed within the adopting
county, then the overall tax rate for the county will be held at a maximum. If
CAGIT is in effect, then the total county income tax rate may not exceed 1.25%;
and if COIT is in effect, then the total county income tax rate may not exceed
1%. One last item of interest for the legalities behind EDIT, COIT, or CAGIT,
is how a "county taxpayer" is defined. The state defines a county taxpayer as a
"resident of the county or one who maintains a principal place of business or
employment in the county and does not reside in another county in which EDIT,
COIT, or CAGIT are in effect."
   The one requirement for how these monies can be spent is that the adopting
county must have a capital improvement plan identifying each and every project
which EDIT funds will be funding. The capital improvement plan must deal with a
time period of no less than two years and must deal with projects that cost at
last 75% of the EDIT revenue received by the county.
County Option Income Tax
   The County Option Income Tax (COIT), however, is used primarily for the
repayment of any notes or bonds which the municipality might have issued. By
following nearly the same guidelines as for the Economic Development Income
Tax, COIT may easily be established within a county. The ordinance imposing
COIT must, however, be passed after January 1 or a year but before April 1.
   The basis of COIT (Appendix), is for the monies generated by the tax (a
homestead credit up to 8%) to replace any revenue lost due to this increased
homestead credit, and then any money left over in this "coffer" can be used to
pay off any outstanding notes and/or bonds. The term the state uses to describe
this action is "fixing one's budget."
County Adjusted Gross Income Tax
   The County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (Appendix), as compared to the County
Option Income Tax, can only be imposed if the COIT has not already been imposed
in the county. The opposite holds true for the County Option Income Tax. Once
again, the use of the CAGIT is for a completely different purpose than that of
EDIT or COIT. When CAGIT monies are received by the county then the monies are
distributed to civil taxing units as property tax replacement credits or to
school corporations as property tax replacement credits.
   This certain county income may only be imposed at a rate of either 0.5%,
0.75%, or 1%. Similarly to both the EDIT and COIT, the County Adjusted Gross
Income Tax must follow the guidelines as established by the state for passing
the appropriate ordinance describing the CAGIT. Unlike both the EDIT and the
COIT, the CAGIT may not result in immediate monies for the county. At least not
in the first year of its imposition. For the most part the CAGIT monies, as
authorized by IC 8-18-22, repay notes or bonds for the construction of county
highways and/or bridges.
Impact Fees
   The impact fees, as mentioned several times throughout this document, are
not only a prime way to help restrict growth but also a great way to help get
infrastructure, and other such public improvements, completed. The purpose of
the impact fee is to offset the cost of infrastructure improvement to a new
development. The fees are in fact charged to this new development. Their manner
is left up to agreement between the municipality and the developer.
   There are certain restrictions, however, that dictate how the establishing
ordinance must be set up, and by when. For a municipality to use an impact fee
ordinance the municipality must establish two separate "impact zones," and must
incorporate the usage of a "zone improvement plan." This ZIP reviews the
current infrastructure status, what that status might be in ten years, and what
it will take to improve these conditions.
