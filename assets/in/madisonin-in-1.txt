Clerk of the date of passage by the Council. When a bill is vetoed by the
Mayor, the message of veto, together with the bill, shall be reported and read
to the Council by the Clerk after which the presiding officer shall ask the
Council whether the bill shall be passed over the Mayor's veto and the vote
thereon shall be taken by calling the roll, and if two-thirds, or more, of all
members of the Council vote "aye" ("yes") when their names are called, the bill

Council of the city, its officers and committees:
   (A)   Preparations for meetings.
      (1)   The Mayor's assistant is to receive all proposed resolutions prior
to the close of business on the fifth day preceding the Council meeting.
         (a)   Resolutions are to be placed on the agenda with their title and
sponsoring Council member(s);
         (b)   Resolutions should be presented to Council members, in their
printed form, on the fourth day prior to the Council meeting; and
         (c)   A resolution may be proposed at any time following the cut-off
date if it is approved by the Council President Pro Tempore or the Mayor.
      (2)   The Mayor's assistant is to receive all proposed bills prior to the
close of business on the fifth day preceding the next Council meeting.
         (a)   Proposed bills are to be placed on the agenda with their title
and sponsoring Council member; and
         (b)   Proposed bills should be presented to Council members, in their
printed form, on the fourth day prior to the Council meeting.
      (3)   If a department head has a written report, they should make every
effort to present it to the Mayor's assistant five days prior to the Council
meeting.
      (4)   City Council member packets and the supporting documents should be
presented to Council members no later than four days prior to a meeting.
   (B)   The Mayor shall preside over all meetings of the Common Council. In
case of the absence of the Mayor during any meeting, or in the event that they
should be disqualified to preside by the application of any law of the state or
ordinance of the city at any meeting thereof, then the President Pro Tempore,
who shall be elected at the first regular meeting of the Council held after
their election as such Council, shall preside (see IC 36-4-6-8).
    (C)   The presiding officer of the Common Council shall call the members to
order promptly at the date and hour appointed for the meeting thereof. During
the session the presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum and shall
decide all questions of order. An appeal from any decision rendered by the
presiding officer may be taken by any member whereupon the Clerk-Treasurer
shall call the roll of members, and those who favor sustaining the decision of
the presiding officer shall vote "aye" ("yes"), and those who oppose sustaining
such decision shall vote "nay" ("no") and if a majority of the members present
vote "nay," the decision of the President shall be deemed overruled. Otherwise,
it shall be deemed sustained.
   (D)   The presiding officer shall state all questions distinctly and ask
that all who are in favor say "aye" ("yes"), and after the affirmative voice is
expressed, ask all who are opposed say "nay" ("no"), and then shall decide
whether the question is carried by affirmative or negative vote. However, if a
decision is called for by any member, the Clerk-Treasurer shall call the roll,
and each member, when their name is called, shall respond "aye" ("yes"), to
vote for the affirmative of such question, and "nay" ("no"), to vote for the
negative thereof. The result of the vote as thus cast shall be announced by the
Clerk-Treasurer to the President who shall then decide whether such question
has been passed by a majority vote of all the other members present and voting.
   (E)   All questions relating to the priority of business shall be decided

of an employee's illness or accident must be presented to the city to qualify
for sick pay benefits.

commensurate with their disability and permit reasonable examinations and
inquiries by a city medical representative or other representative as, in the

40 hours sick pay credit plus the opportunity to earn four hours sick pay
credit for each month worked after January 1, 1979, but in no case shall
accumulated sick pay credit extend beyond the 240 hours maximum.

under the city group insurance plan, or any benefits paid under any federal,
state, county, or city law.
      (3)    Illness resulting in absence of more than seven consecutive work
days, is compensable under the city's health and accident insurance policy.
Absence because of accident, that is not work-related, is compensable starting
the first day of disability. This comprehensive plan is explained in the group
insurance policy. Any questions concerning benefits should be directed to the
supervisor.
   (C)   Workmen's Compensation. In the event an employee is injured on the job
and sustains a work- related injury or illness, he is fully covered by
Workmen's Compensation and will be paid the maximum benefits provided by state
law. An employee who is absent due to a work-related injury or illness shall
maintain his seniority rights until he is recovered or a permanent settlement
under the Workmen's Compensation statute has been made.

(Ord. 1976-7, passed 3-16-76)
§ 34.51 PARENTAL LEAVE.
   (A)   City of Madison parental leave policy.
      (1)   The City of Madison will provide paid parental leave to eligible
full-time employees upon the birth or adoption of a minor child (under 18).
Paid parental leave is intended to give new parents additional flexibility and
time to bond with their new child, adjust to their new family situation, and
balance their professional obligations. Paid parental leave runs concurrently
and in accordance with eligibility for Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
         (a)   Paid parental leave for primary caregiver: The City of Madison
will provide up to 160 hours of paid parental leave at 100% of the employee's
regular, straight-time weekly pay to eligible employees.
         (b)   Paid parental leave for non-primary caregivers: The City of
Madison will provide up to 80 hours of paid parental leave at 100% of the
employee's regular straight-time weekly pay to eligible employees.
      (2)   After the paid parental leave is exhausted, the balance of FMLA
leave (if applicable) may be compensated through the employees accrued paid
time off (sick, vacation, and earned compensatory time) and short-term
disability (if applicable).
   (B)   Eligibility. Paid parental leave is available to all full-time and
benefit-eligible employees who have been employed with the city for at least 12
months and have worked full-time during the 12 months preceding the birth or
adoption of a child.
      (1)   Paid parental leave may only be taken following the birth of an
employee's child or the adoption of a minor child (under 18). An individual who
adopts a spouse's child is not eligible for parental leave.
      (2)   Human Resources is responsible for administering this policy and
determining eligibility for parental leave.
   (C)   Benefit provisions.
      (1)   Paid parental leave is compensated at 100% of the employee's
regular, straight-time weekly pay and is paid on a bi-weekly basis on regularly
scheduled pay dates. Paid parental leave does not reduce an eligible employee's
balance of any other paid leave such as sick, vacation, or holiday.
      (2)   Paid parental leave is a benefit of employment and will not be
considered a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions,
and disciplinary actions.
      (3)   Paid parental leave may be taken continuously or in one-week
increments within the first six months following the birth or adoption of a
child. Parents who choose to take paid parental leave incrementally must
consult with their supervisor and make a reasonable effort to schedule the
incremental parental leave so as not to unduly disrupt the department's
operations.
      (4)   As with other forms of paid leave, benefits will remain the same
while an employee is on paid parental leave. For example, vacation and sick
leave benefits will continue to accrue, the city will continue to pay its share
of the cost of an employee's group health insurance, and the employee's share
of the premium will continue to be deducted from the employee's pay. Similarly,
all deductions from income will continue during paid parental leave.
      (5)   The holiday will be paid if a city-recognized holiday occurs during
paid parental leave. The use of holiday pay, however, does not extend the
length of leave.
      (6)   Paid parental leave runs concurrently and in accordance with
eligibility for FMLA. Any leave taken under this policy that qualifies as FMLA
leave will count toward the twelve weeks of available FMLA in 12 months.
      (7)   Employees on paid parental leave and FMLA are ineligible to work
alternative employment.
      (8)   If both parents are employed by the City of Madison, they may take
paid parental leave concurrently or at separate times, according to their
preference.
      (9)   Paid parental leave is only available to an employee once in 12
months.
      (10)   Any unused paid parental leave will be forfeited at the end of the
six-month time frame.
      (11)   Upon termination, or upon a change in employment status to a
position that is not eligible for benefits (ex: transition from full-time to
part-time), unused paid parental leave will not be paid.
   (D)   Requesting paid parental leave.
      (1)   Employees interested in taking paid parental leave must provide
their supervisor and Human Resources with notice of the anticipated leave at
least 30 days before the proposed date of the leave (or if the leave is not
foreseeable, as soon as possible).
      (2)   Eligible employees may request additional time to extend their
leave, subject to the employee's direct supervisor's approval. Additional time
may be compensated through the employees accrued paid time off (sick, vacation,
and earned compensatory time) or may be unpaid.

CONDUCT; DISCIPLINE; COMPLAINTS
§ 34.65 RULES OF CONDUCT.
   In order to protect the health and safety of all employees, to protect the
city's goodwill and property, to maintain an orderly and efficient operation,
and maintain proper standards of conduct, the city has established basic rules
of conduct that employees are required to follow. These basic rules of conduct
shall be posted and any employee who violates the rules or fails to maintain
proper standards of conduct shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including discharge.
(Ord. 1982-6, passed - - )
§ 34.66 DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The city recognizes the principle of progressive discipline for
offenses that do not merit summary discharge. Depending upon the seriousness of
the offense one of the following disciplinary measures shall apply:
      (1)   Written reprimand.
      (2)    Three-day suspension from work without pay.
      (3)    Discharge.
   (B)   It is felt that in most instances offenses are of minor nature and in
such instances the supervisor shall discuss the matter with the employee. This
oral procedure is not considered disciplinary action.
   (C)   Disciplinary measures that become part of the employee's personal
record shall not be maintained as part of that record beyond 12 months from the
date of the disciplinary action, providing there is no progressive discipline
given the employee during this 12-month time period.
   (D)   The disciplinary procedure outlined above may not necessarily apply to
probationary, part-time, or temporary employees.
(Ord. 1982-6, passed - - )
§ 34.67 EMPLOYEE COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   The city believes each employee has the right to be heard when such employee
feels he is being treated in an unreasonable or unfair manner.
   (A)   To assure an orderly and effective method of resolving employee
complaints, the following procedure is to be followed.
      (1)   Step 1. The employee is to discuss the matter with his supervisor
who has the responsibility to listen to the complaint, investigate the matter,
and attempt to resolve it promptly.
      (2)    Step 2. In the event the supervisor is unable to satisfactorily
settle the matter within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed three
working days, the employee may present the complaint to the department head
within three days of the supervisor's answer. The department head shall
investigate the matter and personally discuss the matter with the employee in
an attempt to resolve it. The department head shall give the employee an answer
to the complaint within three days after the meeting. Should the matter remain
unresolved, the employee may present the complaint to the Mayor, in writing,
within three days of the department head's answer.
      (3)    Step 3. The employee's written complaint shall be reviewed by the
Mayor who shall submit a written decision within a reasonable time period.
Every effort shall be made to reach such a decision within a ten-day period
from receipt of the employee's written complaint.
      (4)    Step 4. If the complaint concerns a disciplinary matter or an
issue involving the application of work rules, the employee may, within three
days of the Mayor's answer at Step 3 advise the Mayor in writing that he
desires to have the matter investigated by a fact-finding body. In this event
the Mayor shall refer the matter to the Labor Management Commission. The
Commission shall appoint a committee comprised of three members of the
Commission, one from each sector, and the Executive Director of the Commission
who shall investigate the matter, including the gathering of evidence and the
taking of testimony. After evaluation of the issue the committee shall submit
its findings and recommendations to the Mayor who shall give such
recommendations due consideration and advise the employee in writing of his
decision, such decision shall be final and binding. Every effort shall be made
to complete Step 4 within 30 days of the employee's written request.
   (B)   In order for any complaint to be valid it shall be timely and shall be
made known to the supervisor within five working days of the alleged
occurrence. Reference to days at any step of the complaint procedure is
considered working days.
   (C)   Any complaint, not processed by the employee within the time limits at
any step of the complaint procedure, shall be considered settled on the basis
of the city representative's last answer.
   (D)   The complainant may at his discretion obtain the assistance of a co-
worker in presenting his complaint at the third stage of the complaint
procedure.

DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE
§ 34.80 PROHIBITED DRUGS.
   (A)   “PROHIBITED DRUGS” are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
8120 and 21 C.F.R. 1308.11-1308.15), and prescription-controlled substances
which have not been prescribed for the employee by a licensed physician or
dentist for specific treatment purposes. Abuse of prescription or over-the-
counter drugs will also be treated as a substance abuse problem under this
subchapter.
   (B)   This subchapter prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other
controlled substances while on the job or on city premises (including vehicles
used for city business). These include, but are not limited to, marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over
to the state police and may lead to criminal prosecution.
(Ord. 2016-17, passed 10-4-16; Am. Ord. 2020-11, passed 8-4-20)
§ 34.81 ALCOHOL.
   (A)   The use of alcohol on the job or on city premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off city premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for city business is
strictly prohibited.
   (B)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic beverage
containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on city premises,
unless their possession is part of an authorized official event. Possession of
such containers in vehicles used for city business is never authorized.
(Ord. 2016-17, passed 10-4-16; Am. Ord. 2020-11, passed 8-4-20)
§ 34.82 REPORTING VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Employees must, as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this subchapter and report any conviction to the city under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off city premises when conducting city
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the city within five business
days after the conviction. The city will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-
Free Workplace Act of 1988.)
   (B)   An employee who is involved with off-the job illegal drug activity may
be considered in violation of this subchapter. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the city will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including, but not limited to, any adverse
effect the employee’s actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the city’s reputation and image.
   (C)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be directed
to the Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 2016-17, passed 10-4-16; Am. Ord. 2020-11, passed 8-4-20)
§ 34.83 EMPLOYEE REHABILITATION.
   (A)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual’s responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the city will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug- and alcohol-related problems.
   (B)   Employees with a personal, drug- or alcohol-related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program,
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
   (C)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment, nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program, or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct in violation of this
subchapter or any other city policies or job requirements.
   (D)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
   (E)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the course
of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline).
(Ord. 2016-17, passed 10-4-16; Am. Ord. 2020-11, passed 8-4-20)
§ 34.84 TESTING.
   The city will ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug tests.
   (A)   Alcohol or drug tests may be required for employees in the following
circumstances:
      (1)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior is
reasonably indicative of substance abuse.
      (2)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation
program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the city.
      (3)   When required by law.
      (4)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
city. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
   (B)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the city. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

§ 35.16 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND.
   (A)   An account is established for the deposit of monies for the city’s
Economic Development Revolving Loan program. The monies will come from the
balance of the city’s original Economic Development Loan program (established

FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 35.80 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "CAPITAL OUTLAYS." Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets; and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
government's general fixed assets.
   "ENTERPRISE FUNDS." Those funds used to account for operations (a) that are
financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise, where
the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including
depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a
continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
(b) where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of
revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and
other purposes. The enterprise funds of the city shall include the municipally-
owned water and sewage utilities. Operation of these utilities shall require
enterprise fund accounting and reporting.
   "FIXED ASSET." Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods or services are termed property, plant and
equipment or fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the ordinary
course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the items (e.g. land, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and
fixtures).
   “HISTORICAL COST." The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services
at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment, and most inventories
are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute.
   “TANGIBLE ASSETS.” Assets that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses. They may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard
and smelled.

      (2)    The city will capitalize and tag items with an individual value
equal to or greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to
form one unit with a total value greater than the above mentioned limit will be
one unit.
      (3)   Shipping charges, consultant fees, and any other cost directly
associated with the purchase, delivery, or set-up, (including contractors and/
or city works/salary and benefits) which makes such equipment operable for its
intended purpose will be capitalized.
      (4)   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and equipment
will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following

         (a)   Total costs exceed  $5,000.
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years.
         (c)   The total costs will be greater than the current book value and

fencing, retaining walls, pools, outside fountains, planter underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (3)   Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets that are of
value only to the public. For example, Main Street is a public street with
greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon city- owned land that
provide support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk down the road for
public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is not capitalized.
However, sidewalks installed upon city-owned land for use by the public and for
the support of our facility are capital assets.
      (4)   The city will capitalize new improvements other than buildings only

§ 35.82 RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.
   (A)   The city and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure was
made in accordance with the chart of accounts of the Cities and Towns
Accounting Manual. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the city and its departments; the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost, or where the historical
cost is undeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.
   (B)   The city's municipally-owned utilities shall record acquisition of
fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When
an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply recorded as the
amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its purchase and
preparation for intended use. Assets may be acquired under a number of other
arrangements including:
      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price.
      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract.
      (3)   Acquisition under capital lease.
      (4)   Acquisition by exchange of non-monetary assets.
      (5)   Acquisition by issuance of securities.
      (6)   Acquisition by self-construction.
      (7)   Acquisition by donation or discovery.
   (C)   Some of these arrangements present special problems relating to the
cost to be recorded, for example, in utility accounting, interest during a
period of construction has long been recognized as a part of the asset cost.
Reference to an intermediate accounting manual will illustrate the recording of
acquisition of assets under the aforementioned acquisition arrangements. For
purposes of recording fixed assets of the utilities the valuation of assets
shall be based on historical cost.
   (D)   In addition, an asset register (prescribed form 211) shall be
maintained to provide a detailed record of the capital assets of the
governmental unit.
(Ord. 2000-13, passed 12-5-00)
§ 35.83 SAFEGUARDING OF ASSETS.
   Accounting controls shall be designed and implemented to provide reasonable
assurances that:
   (A)   Capital expenditures made by the city, its various departments and
utilities be in accordance with management's authorization as documented in the
minutes.
   (B)   Transactions of the utilities be recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
principles.

served on the customer a written final notice of such delinquency or such
additional time as prescribed by Rule 16 of the Public Service Commission, the
transfer station charge account to said customer may be discontinued without
further notice. Once service has been discontinued for nonpayment of delinquent
bill, a charge of $25 will be made for the issue of a new permit, but such
permit will not be made until after all delinquent bills and charges, if any,
owed by the customer to the city have been paid.

whose wastewater has been shown to violate the industrial wastewater discharge
permit or any provisions of this chapter may be followed by the city in an
effort to assist the user and to ensure compliance with this chapter without
court action. The proceedings outlined in this division are voluntary and are
not to be construed as conditioned precedent for the city using any of the
remedies forthset in chapter.
      (2)   Should analysis by the city indicate that the limitations on
discharge have been exceeded in the discharge of a user, a violation is alleged
to have occurred. The city shall notify the user, in writing, (which writing is
hereinafter called a notice of review) as to the particulars of such alleged
violation and set a time and place for a meeting (hereinafter called a review
meeting) to be attended by representatives of the city and the user. The
purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss and establish means of preventing
violations of any of the limitations on discharge.
(Ord. 1984-35, passed 12-18-84)
§ 51.131 COMPULSORY COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES; MEETING; DIRECTIVES.
   (A)   Standards meeting. Should a violation by a user occur following a
review meeting with that user, the city shall notify the offending user, in
writing, through a notice of standards meeting as to the particulars of such
violation and set a time and place for a meeting (hereinafter called a
standards meeting) to be attended by representatives of the city and the user.
The city may upon determination that a violation has occurred, send the user
notice of standards meeting without first having a review meeting. The purpose
of such a meeting shall be to establish such procedures, investigations, and
studies as the city deems necessary and desirable for the determination of such
action as it may require of the user to control and prevent discharges in
violation of the limitations on discharge.
   (B)   Compliance directive.
      (1)   Following the completion of the investigations and studies
described in above, the city may direct and require the user to take such
action as may be required to control and prevent discharges in violation of the
limitations on discharge, including pretreatment of those wastewaters which
contain or may contain pollutants subject to limitations on discharge.
      (2)   If the city has sufficient information at the time of the standards
meeting to determine necessary action, it may, at the time of the standards
meeting, direct and require the user to take such action, including
pretreatment, without further investigation or study, and the user shall
comply.
      (3)   The user shall cooperate fully with the city in making such
investigations and studies as may be required.
      (4)   Following a directive in writing hereinafter called compliance
directive by the city to require the user to take necessary action, the user
shall, within 180 days, submit to the city for review, a schedule for
compliance and preliminary information regarding any pretreatment facilities to
be provided. Such preliminary information shall include, without limitation,
the nature and type of facilities and equipment proposed, their general
location and the degree of treatment anticipated. The city shall review and
discuss the schedule and preliminary information with the user. Final
acceptance by the city of the schedule and plans, modified as required by the
city following discussions with the user, shall be within 30 days of the
submittal of an acceptable schedule and plans to the city. Such approval does
not release the user from responsibility for compliance with the provisions of
this chapter, either before or after any pretreatment facilities are
operational, nor does such approval constitute a liability of the city should
the facilities fail to produce an acceptable pollutant concentration.
      (5)   The user shall keep the city informed as to the progress of work to
provide required pretreatment facilities through written reports submitted
monthly.
      (6)   Failure to comply with the compliance directive of the city
regarding pretreatment facilities or failure to comply with the schedule, as
approved, shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of this chapter and may
be grounds for revocation of the users wastewater discharge permit.
   (C)   Variance procedures. Any user issued a compliance directive under the
provisions of this subchapter shall apply for a variance at least five days
prior to the next monthly Board meeting, petition the Board for a variance or
variances in accordance with this chapter. Failure to so apply shall be a
violation of the chapter and shall subject the user to the penalties provided
in this chapter.
(Ord. 1984-35, passed 12-18-84) Penalty, see
§ 51.999
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.145 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board may grant individual variances beyond the limitations
prescribed in this chapter. The maximum variance on limitation of discharge
(hereinafter maximum variance) shall be two and one-half times the limitation
on discharge for specific pollutants as set forth in this chapter; provided,
however, that the Board may, upon a showing by a petitioner that said maximum
variance would be insufficient for its needs and would work an arbitrary or
unreasonable hardship on the petitioner, grant on a one-time, exceptional,
nonrenewable basis, limitations on discharges in excess of said maximum
variance; provided further that the burden of showing such arbitrary and
unreasonable hardship shall be on the petitioner who shall, before such
variance is granted, show such arbitrary and unreasonable hardship to the Board
by clear and convincing proof. In no case shall the Board grant any variance
whose terms might or could cause interference as such term is defined in
§ 51.001.
   (B)   In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions,
exceptions, time limitations, duration, and other limitations as the policies
of this chapter and the Act may require. Except as provided by this chapter,
any variance granted by the Board shall not exceed three years and shall be
granted upon the condition that the person who receives such variance shall
make such periodic progress reports as the Board shall specify. Such variance
may be extended from year to year by affirmative action of the Board, but only
if satisfactory progress has been shown.
   (C)   Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing a petition for
variance with the Superintendent. The city shall specify information required
to be submitted by the petitioner. The Superintendent shall investigate such
petition, consider the views of persons who might be adversely affected by the
granting of a variance and make a report to the Board of the disposition of the
petition. If the Board in its discretion concludes that a hearing would be
advisable or if the Superintendent or any other person files a written
objection to the granting of such variance within 15 days, then a hearing shall
be held under the provisions of this chapter and the burden of proof shall be
on the petitioner.
   (D)   If the Board fails to take final action upon a variance request within
60 days after the filing of a petition, the petitioner may deem the petition
granted under this chapter for a period not to exceed one year. However, the
period of 60 days shall not run any such period of time during which the Board
is without sufficient membership to constitute a quorum as set forth in the
enabling legislation for the city.
   (E)   If the limits of a variance are exceeded or if any terms of a variance
are violated by the person granted a variance, a violation of this chapter is
deemed to have occurred and the variance may be revoked on 30 days notice.
(Ord. 1984-35, passed 12-18-84)

applicable state and federal statutes and regulations, or the following, is
subject to having its permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this
chapter.
      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge as determined by the user's or city's
analysis.
      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in process
activity or wastewater constituents and characteristics.
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises by city
representative for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.
      (4)   Tampering with, disrupting, or destroying city equipment as
determined by the Board, by a preponderance of evidence which determination
shall be final.
      (5)   Failure to report an accidental discharge of a pollutant in a
reportable quantity.
      (6)   Failure to report an upset of user's treatment facilities.
      (7)   Violations of conditions of the permit.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The Superintendent may order any user who causes or allows an
authorized discharge to show cause before the Board why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Board regarding
the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the Board why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing

payment of the actual cost therefor.
      (4)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing either: that the discharge
permit be revoked and the service be disconnected; that following a specified
time the permit shall be revoked and sewer service discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been
installed and operated properly to comply with the discharge permit; direct the
user to cease the unauthorized discharge effective after a specified period of
time; or that such other relief as deemed necessary by the Board to abate the
discharge be granted. Further orders and directives as are necessary may be
issued.
      (5)   Following an order of revocation, the user shall cease discharging
to the city POTW. Failure to do so shall be evidence of continuing harm to city
and provide grounds for the granting of injunctive relief or temporary
restraining orders.
   (D)   Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter shall,
following a hearing before the Board of Trustees, be subject to immediate
disconnection of the sewer servicing the property upon or in connection with
which the violation occurred.

waste discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage
system. The city shall have the right to measure the strength and content in
such manner and by such method as may be deemed practical in the circumstances,
in order to determine the appropriate charge. Any customer consistently
discharging wastewater stronger than domestic strength (225 milligrams per
liter of BOD or 250/mg/l of Suspended Solids) will be subject to surcharges,
based upon both the flow and strength of the wastewater and the costs of
collecting and analyzing samples. The rates for excessive strengths are as
prescribed in the Madison Sewer Division's Sewer Regulations, which are

sewer system. The City shall have the right to measure the strength and content
in such manner and by such method as may be deemed practical in the
circumstances, in order to determine the appropriate charge.
      (2)   City surcharge rates. Any customer consistently discharging
wastewater stronger than domestic strength (225 milligrams per liter of BOD or
250 milligrams per liter of Suspended Solids (“SS”)) will be subject to
surcharges, based upon both the flow and strength of the wastewater and the
costs of collecting and analyzing samples. The rates for excessive strengths
are as prescribed in the Madison Sewer Division’s Sewer Regulations, which are
$0.407 per pound of BOD in excess of 225 milligram per liter or $0.815 per
pound of BOD per liter in excess of 625 milligram per liter, and $0.337 per
pound of SS in excess of 250 milligram per liter.
      (3)   Additional city surcharge. In addition to the surcharges described
above, any customer consistently discharging wastewater stronger than domestic
wastewater will be charged for the cost to collect and analyze each sample. The
cost for this work shall be $30 for each sample and shall be subject to
periodic review by the city.
   (F)   Individual contracts. Service to individual establishments may be by

§ 6.9 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under §
6.5 of this appendix. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
6.1,
6.3, and
6.4 of this appendix.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Utilities
Manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this appendix, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 6.10 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Utilities Manager or other parties
approved by EPA.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 6.11 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Utilities Manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in Sections
6.1 and
6.3 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Utilities
Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs
Section 6.4 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 6.13 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this appendix shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this appendix and
any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years or longer, Including documentation associated with best management
practices. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Utilities Manager.

§ 10.3 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Utilities Manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this appendix, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Utilities Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user as defined in §
1.4 of this appendix, and required by §
4.6(A) of this appendix. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 10.4 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Utilities Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this appendix, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utilities Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

   (A)   When the Utilities Manager finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this appendix, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Utilities Manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a

permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Utilities Manager may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed $2,500 as provided by IC 36-1-3-8. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8% per month. A lien against the user's

   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Utilities Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Utilities Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event
the user's appeal is successful, the payment together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Utilities Manager may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 10.7 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Utilities Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause
an irnminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Utilities Manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utilities Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Utilities Manager
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Utilities Manager that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
10.8 of this appendix are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Utilities Manager prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under §§
10.3 or
10.8 of this appendix.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 12.1 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, "UPSET" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Utilities
Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial detenrunation on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 12.2 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A users shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
2.1(A) of this appendix or the specific prohibitions in §
2.1(B)(3) through (16) of this appendix if it can prove that it did not know or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit (No. IN0025666) and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
(Ord. 1998-20, passed 11-17-98; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 9-18-12)
§ 12.3 BYPASS.
   (A) For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   "BYPASS." The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE." Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of abypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Utilities Manager, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Utilities Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Utilities Manager may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utilities Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied
if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Utilities Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Utilities Manager determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

§ 54.003 FINDINGS.
   The City of Madison finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the City
of Madison or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times subjected to
flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, and
when not properly designed and built results in increased stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion,
adverse impacts to habitat and natural resources, and increased sediment
transport and deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the City of Madison will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the City of Madison's water bodies, water resources, and
overall quality of life;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the City of
Madison will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement,
adversely affect the City of Madison's water bodies, water resources, and
overall quality of life;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit discharges can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of
stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting and implementing standards, criteria, and procedures
contained and referenced in this chapter will help reduce deleterious effects
of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges;
   (I)   Adopting and enforcing this chapter is necessary for the preservation
of the public health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural
resources, and for compliance with certain state and federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.004 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Madison through the regulation
of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within the City of Madison. This chapter establishes methods for
managing the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the stormwater
system associated with developments and illicit discharges in order to comply
with State and Federal regulations. The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm system from
construction site runoff.
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm system from
runoff from new development and redevelopment.
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm system.
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 54.023 STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC MATERIAL.
   Storage or stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material within any
watercourse, or in its associated floodway or floodplain, is strictly
prohibited. Storage or stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material, including
sewage treatment plant stockpiles, on active construction sites must include
adequate protection and/or containment so as to prevent any such materials from
entering any temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance or watercourse.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.024 PRIVATE PROPER1Y MAINTENANCE DUTIES
   (A)   The city is not responsible for routine maintenance of unimproved
channels. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
located within their property boundaries, free of trash, debris, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. Specifically, the owner or lessee is required to
maintain and trim their own watercourses. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (B)   It is important from a public policy standpoint to differentiate
between public and private drainage since many complaints received are actually
the responsibility of individual landowners. For the purposes of this chapter,
the two shall be defined as follows:
      (1)   Private drainage is defined as drainage which is located on private
property within an unimproved channel and does not involve a public drainage
easement or right-of-way. Some private drainage may extend onto multiple
properties and where the maintenance was not specified on the subdivision plats
or other legal documents, those drainage facilities and their maintenance also
falls within responsibility of the individual landowners.
      (2)   Public drainage is defined as drainage involving a public drainage
easement or is located in an improved channel within the city's right-of-way.
Public Drainage infrastructure includes pipes, curb inlets, grates, and basins.

§ 54.025 SPILL REPORTING.
   (A)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a waterbody any
substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately
inform the City of Madison concerning the discharge. A written report
concerning the discharge shall be filed with the City of Madison and IDEM, by
the dischargers, within five days. The written report shall specify:
      (1)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
      (2)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
      (3)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge;
      (4)   All measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;
      (5)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter, if a different person.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.026 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Stormwater system. The City of Madison has the authority to
periodically inspect the portion of the stormwater system under the City of
Madison's control, as well as receiving waters, in an effort to detect and
eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the system. This inspection
will include a screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system in
order to determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the stormwater
system. It could also include sample collections and related in the stormwater
system to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a discrete connection, such as dumping, contaminated runoff surface runoff
into the public system, or other related illicit discharges.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the stormwater system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the City of
Madison may inspect and/or obtain samples from stormwater runoff of the subject
discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Upon
request, the discharger shall allow the City of Madison's properly identified
representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all hours
necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The City of Madison
or its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's
property the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection.
Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement
action as described in §§
54.105 through
54.108.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the City of Madison, the
City of Madison has the authority to inspect new development and re-development
sites to verify that all onsite stormwater conveyances and connections to the
stormwater system are in compliance with this section.

STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 54.040 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for developments or redevelopments disturbing one acre or more of land
or disturbances of less than one acre but part of a larger common plan that
will disturb one acre or more and is located within the City of Madison or
subject to the City of Madison regulations. The City of Madison may waive the
requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization when
fully justified and substantiated by sound, current engineering methodology
that demonstrates no adverse impact to downstream and surrounding properties,
habitats, water quality, in-stream conditions, and overall quality of life.
Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention requirements are
provided under §
54.041.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.041 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
City of Madison do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff as well as
compensation for loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in §
54.005) located within the City of Madison or subject to the City of Madison
regulations. Release rate requirements, downstream restriction considerations,
acceptable outlet, adjoining property impact considerations, policy on dams and
levees, policy on Fluvial Erosion Hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain
storage rates are detailed in the City of Madison Stormwater Design Guide.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the City of Madison to discourage direct release of runoff
from a new development or redevelopment without providing detention. However,
in certain circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis) adopted by
the City of Madison substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct
release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the
detention requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special
circumstances when such a waiver may be considered by the City of Madison
include situations where the design of a regional pond has already taken into
account the provision of direct release in certain areas in the watershed.

§ 54.043 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins, conveyance
systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-of-way
shall be placed within an easement. No trees or shrubs shall be planted, nor
any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement, unless otherwise
accepted by the City of Madison. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the City of Madison's Stormwater
Design Guide and the City of Madison's Subdivision and Planning & Zoning
Regulations. All drainage improvements performed relative to the conveyance of
stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within the latter
easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner association.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.044 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without
the consent of the City of Madison staff, whose decision may be appealed to the
City of Madison's body with authority to grant appeals of the City of Madison.
All existing drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to said
facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in §§
54.105 through
54.108.

Madison and the commencement of construction activities, the City of Madison
has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this section, the Stormwater Design Guide,
and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   The City of Madison also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, in
addition to any prescribed Operation & Maintenance procedures, and shall not be
subsequently altered, revised, or replaced except as approved by the City of
Madison. If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the
facility will be notified by the City of Madison and will be required to take
all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to
correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as specified in the
notification letter, the City of Madison will undertake the work and collect
from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 54.055 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The City of Madison will require a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion prevention and sediment control measures,
to be submitted as part of a project's construction plans and specifications.
Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the City of Madison that
includes clearing, grading, excavation, or other land disturbing activities
resulting in the disturbance of one acre or more of total land area is subject
to the requirements of this section. This includes both new development and re-
development. This section also applies to disturbances of land that are part of
a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will
ultimately disturb one acre or more of total land area. Section
54.057 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM's CSGP shall also be in compliance with the

§ 54.056 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the City of Madison, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans
as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and
construction sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be
retained for at least three years from the date the project permit is
terminated. For land disturbances totaling one acre or more, appropriate
erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the City of
Madison Stormwater Design Guide must be designed and shown on the plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the City of Madison
Stormwater Design Guide.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.057 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

determining applicability of this section to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must
comply with this section unless the total combined disturbance of all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual and the City of Madison Stormwater Design Guide. The
methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the
above stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained through IDEM.
   (C)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City of Madison Stormwater Design Guide.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)

site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the City of Madison, shall
monitor and manage project construction and stormwater activities. The trained
individual shall perform a written evaluation of the project site:
      (1)   Twenty-four hours prior to a qualifying event or by the end of the
next business day following each measurable storm event.
      (2)   If there are no qualifying storm events within a given week, the
site should be monitored at least once in that week.
      (3)   In the event of multiple qualifying storm events during a work week
(Monday through Friday), no more than three inspections are required.
      (4)   A minimum of one time per month for specific areas within the
project area which are stabilized with permanent vegetation cover of at least
70% density and/or erosion resistant armoring is installed. Weekly monitoring
must resume if the vegetative cover fails, there is evidence of erosion in the
area, or IDEM/inspecting authority requires weekly monitoring to resume.
   (C)   A qualifying storm event is defined as precipitation accumulation
equal to, or greater than, one-half inch of rainfall within a 24-hour period.
Self-monitoring inspections by the qualified professional inspector shall
continue until the entire site has been stabilized and a notice of termination/
completion letter has been issued by the City of Madison. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the City of Madison Stormwater
Design Guide.
   (D)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the qualified professional inspector for maintenance and
enhancements to stormwater quality measures should be implemented. Substantial
changes to the plan shall involve advance notification in writing from the site
owner to the City of Madison.
   (E)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. The City of Madison has the right to
request complete records of maintenance and monitoring activities involving
stormwater pollution prevention measures. All evaluation reports for the
project site must be made available to the City of Madison, in an organized
fashion, within 48 hours upon request. Examples regarding requirements related
to the project management log are contained in the City of Madison Stormwater
Design Guide.

§ 54.071 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts, and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Madison, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from
stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs), to treat the
Water Quality Volume (WQV) stormwater runoff will be filtered, and harmful
amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   The project site owner must submit to the City of Madison a Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s)
from a pre-approved list of BM P's specified in the City of Madison Stormwater
Design Guide. The SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and Maintenance
Manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
Maintenance Agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the

   (A)   General procedures.
      (1)   Application. The project site owner shall submit an application for
a stormwater management permit to the City of Madison. The application will
include a completed application checklist, construction plan sheets, a
stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan,
and any other necessary support information. Specific information to be
included in the application can be found in § 52.087 below. One copy of each
application must be submitted to the City of Madison. The City of Madison may,
at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to other entities
deemed appropriate by the City of Madison. Additionally, a digital copy of the
construction plans is required in a format accepted by the City of Madison.
      (2)   Review. After the City of Madison's receipt of the application, the
applicant will be notified as to whether their application was complete or
insufficient. The applicant will be asked for additional information if the
application is insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be
reviewed in detail by the City of Madison and/or its plan review consultant(s).
Once all comments have been received and review completed, the City of Madison
will either approve the project, request modifications, or deny the project.
      (3)   Appeals. If the applicant does not agree with or accept the review
findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the City of Madison will place the
project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City of
Madison Board of Public Works and Safety, provided the agenda for the meeting
has not yet been advertised or published. If time for notification does not
allow, the project shall be placed on the following regularly scheduled meeting
of the City of Madison Board of Public Works and Safety. If the project must go
through a scheduled meeting, the City of Madison will furnish the applicant a
complete list of comments and objections to the plans and accompanying data
prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the City of
Madison will either issue a permit, request modifications to the construction
plans, or deny the project.
      (4)   Notification prior to construction. The project site owner must
notify the City of Madison and IDEM before beginning construction. Notification
to the City of Madison shall be in the form of an email to the designated
recipient on the application form. The notification to IDEM shall be in the
form of an online IDEM NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the
pending construction notifications submitted to both the City of Madison and
IDEM 48 hours before the beginning of construction, construction may commence.
      (5)   Notification during construction. Once construction starts, the
project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater
pollution prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit.
      (6)   Construction completion. Upon completion of construction
activities, a Certification of Completion and Compliance and as-built plans
must be submitted to the City of Madison in digital format in the form of an
email. Once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary erosion
and sediment control measures have been removed, a notification shall be sent
to the City of Madison, requesting a termination/completion inspection. The
City of Madison, or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to
verify that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the
requirements of the City of Madison's Stormwater Ordinance and its design guide
and that the terms and conditions of the permit. Once the applicant receives a

§ 54.090 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater management
system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the City of Madison or retained
privately. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the City of
Madison shall require the applicant to provide assurance in form of an
irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the stormwater management plan has
been accepted and before construction begins. Said assurance will guarantee a
good faith execution of the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution
prevention plan, the stormwater quality management plan, and any permit
conditions. The assurance shall be for an amount equal to 125% of the total
costs of all stormwater management measures for the entire project. The above-
mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by a registered
engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the installation and ongoing
monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures and the construction and
ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/
retention facilities, and stormwater quality BMPs, as regulated under this
chapter, until the construction is completed, the site is stabilized, and as-
built plans are accepted by the City of Madison. Assurances shall be for a
minimum of $10,000. All other performance bonds, maintenance bonds or other
assurances required by the City of Madison in accordance with any and all other
ordinances shall also apply and so be required. Local governmental
jurisdictions may require additional performance and/or maintenance assurances.
The intent of this assurance is not only to complete the installation of storm
drain infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate
stormwater pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained.
If adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
stormwater assurance.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed - -)
§ 54.091 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   In granting a stormwater management permit, the City of Madison may impose
such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of
this chapter. The project site owner shall ensure compliance with such terms
and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
54.105 through
54.108. The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation. In the event that a project site
is determined to impact or discharge to a Sensitive Area or is located in an
Impact Drainage Area, the City of Madison may require more stringent stormwater
quantity and quality measures than detailed in this chapter or in the
Stormwater Design Guide.
   (A)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The need
for the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
   (B)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
      (1)   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage areas,
unless good reason for not including them is presented to the City of Madison.
         (a)   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated FEMA
Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the Best Available Data
through IDNR.
         (b)   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the City of
Madison's system.
         (c)   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the City of Madison's system.
         (d)   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
         (e)   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
      (2)   The City of Madison or the City of Madison Engineer is authorized,
but is not required, to classify certain geographical areas as impact drainage
areas. In determining Impact Drainage Areas, the City of Madison may consider
such factors as topography, soil type, capacity of existing drains, and
distance from adequate drainage facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the City of Madison. Special terms and conditions for
development within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater
management permit.
   (C)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The City of Madison is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be
served by regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an
infrastructure development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated
drainage area. The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development
or re-development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the
City of Madison Stormwater Design Guide.

civil infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues
without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the City of Madison may be
deemed a separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition
of a fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this section
are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An
admission or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.

final stormwater management plans, the City of Madison Engineer may order the
work stopped by notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or
causing of such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such
work until authorized by the City of Madison to proceed with the work. A Stop
Work Order will be posted on the site by the City of Madison. It is unlawful
for any person to remove the notice or continue any work on the site without
permission from the City of Madison.
      (2)   The City of Madison may also undertake or cause to be undertaken,
any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this
chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost
of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person
carrying out or participating in the work.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the City of Madison, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the
erosion and sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not
adequate, the project site owner must be notified in writing of the
inadequacies in the erosion and sediment control measures and the project site
owner has 72 hours after receiving written notice to resolve the identified
inadequacies before the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
      (5)   Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work order
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
less than $2,500, and such person shall also pay the costs as may be imposed in
the discretion of the court. Each day that a violation occurs will be
considered a separate offense and may be subject to a separate fine for each
violation. A permit reinstatement fee may also be assessed by the City of
Madison. The amount of the permit reinstatement fee will be equivalent to the
initial permit fee set in accordance with the table in §
54.086.
   (D)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The City of Madison may refuse to
issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements
constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other
responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of
violation or has otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as
determined by the City of Madison.
   (E)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits.
      (1)   The City of Madison may suspend, revoke, or modify any existing
permit that the violator may also have been previously granted by notifying in
writing the permit holder stating the reason for the suspension, revocation, or
modification. Permits may be revoked for:
         (a)   Any substantial departure from the approved application plans or
specifications;
         (b)   Refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or
local law; or
         (c)   For false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the
permit.
      (2)   A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be reinstated after
the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set
forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations
described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon such conditions
as the City of Madison may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (F)   Suspension of access to the stormwater system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the City of Madison finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that
the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the City of Madison may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to immediately comply with all chapter
requirements and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the City of Madison may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage
system or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
         (c)   The City of Madison may allow the person to recommence its
discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Madison
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination
proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person
that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the City of Madison within five days of receipt of the emergency
order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
City of Madison may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of Madison may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to
persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City of Madison will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access.
The violator may petition the City of Madison for a reconsideration and
hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates stormwater system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the City of Madison.

herein. When any provision of this code is found to be in conflict with any

against such real estate and collected as other taxes are collected. The
liability for the expense of removing or abating such nuisance shall be in
addition to any mailing expenditure(s), penalty, and additional fees that may
be imposed for violation of this action. The auditor shall place the total
amount certified on the tax duplicate for the property affected, and the total
amount, including any accrued interest, shall be collected as delinquent taxes
are collected, and shall be disbursed to the city general fund.
   (B)   If the owner of real property fails to pay a bill issued under this
chapter, the city may bring an action in an appropriate court to collect the
amount of the bill, plus any additional costs incurred in the collection,

§ 98.06 DRIVEWAYS.
   No person, firm, public utility or corporation or the agents thereof, shall
locate any driveway adjacent to the streets or alleys in the rights-of-way of
the city, without first making application for and obtaining a permit to do so

a minimum deposit as hereinafter provided in cash or approved surety bond with
the Clerk-Treasurer of the city for the satisfactory performance of the work in
the street or alley in accordance with the specifications outlined in this
section.
   (A)   Application.
      (1)   Within the city limits, no one shall place a driveway adjacent to a
city right-of-way without first obtaining a permit from the Office of Planning,
Preservation and Design.
      (2)   The form of such permit shall be determined by the Office of
Planning, Preservation and Design. Forms shall be available at the Office of
Planning, Preservation and Design or online.
      (3)   Applicants for a permit for any driveway adjacent to a right-of-way
shall submit a sketch or drawing or otherwise clearly communicate the location
and design, and the traffic control plan.
      (4)   Permits issued shall be valid for a period of no more than 90 days
until work commences, and all work shall be performed within an additional 90-
day period. Permit must be posted and visible at the job site.
   (B)   Driveway conditions.
      (1)   In the city, no one shall:
         (a)   Make any alteration within a public right-of-way, block a city
street gutter or;
         (b)   Construct a new driveway for the purpose of driving on and off a
city street, without first obtaining the approval and written permission of the
Office of Planning, Preservation and Design of the city for such driveway. A
permit fee of $25 shall be imposed for each driveway permit (residential or
commercial) issued. Inspections shall be done by an employee of the City of
Madison or third party as directed by the Mayor.
      (2)   The following specifications apply to all that portion of the
driveway which falls within the right-of-way of the city street:
         (a)   All efforts shall be made to locate all driveways off of local
streets, rather than arterial or collector streets. No driveway shall be placed
within 50 feet of an intersecting public street. No driveway shall be placed
closer than ten feet to another driveway as measured at the right-of-way line.
All driveways shall be perpendicular to the street they are connecting to from
the connection point to the right-of-way line.
         (b)   All new residential driveways shall meet the street with a
minimum radius of ten feet. The minimum radius for driveways intended for
commercial traffic or high volumes of vehicle traffic shall be 25 feet. That
portion of the driveway which falls within the right-of-way of the city street
shall have a minimum width of ten feet as measured at the right-of-way for
residential driveways, or a minimum width of 20 feet as measured at the right-
of-way for commercial or high traffic driveways.
         (c)   If the new driveway is to cross a drainage or roadside ditch, or
for any other reason it is deemed necessary that a culvert is required to be
placed in the public right-of-way, such culvert shall be no less than 12 inches
in diameter and 20 feet in length. Larger diameter and length culverts may be
required by the Inspector, if drainage conditions so warrant. In order to
prevent impeding normal drainage, culverts for new driveways are never in any
case to be smaller than the closest upstream culvert.
         (d)   In the construction of the new driveway, the portion which falls
inside the city street right-of-way is to be composed of hard surface material
of the same character as the material of the connecting street and/or sidewalk,
or better surface.
         (e)   Traffic control and safety is the responsibility of the
contractor. If additional traffic control is deemed necessary by the Inspector,
the contractor may be required to utilize Indiana Department of Transportation
Maintenance of Traffic requirements.
         (f)   City sidewalks are not to be used as driveways, nor are they to
be driven upon. Existing city sidewalks are not to be used as portions of the
new driveway. In the construction of the new driveway, the existing city
sidewalk is not to be covered over or crossed by the new driveway material: but
must be removed and the new driveway surface material must be placed flush with
the remaining sidewalk surface, or, if not placed flush with the sidewalk
surface, then sloping ramps must be placed in the sidewalk on each side of the
drive so that there is a smooth continuation from sidewalk to driveway to
sidewalk which is accessible to the handicapped.
         (g)   This section shall apply to any widening or reconstruction of
any existing drive. This section shall not apply to the surfacing or
resurfacing of existing driveways.
   (C)   Warranty. The applicant shall be entitled to a return of their cash
bond or the release of their surety bond once the Inspector has determined that
the work done as contemplated by the permit has been satisfactorily completed
and the applicant has complied with all the terms and conditions of this
section. If no such determination is made within 90 days of the date the bond
is submitted to the city, any cash bond shall be forfeited and paid into the
Local Road and Street Fund of the city and/or the city shall take appropriate
action to collect any surety bond whose proceeds shall be paid into the same
fund.
   (D)   Enforcement. Anyone found in violation of these conditions or found
performing work in the right-of-way without a valid permit, shall be subject to
a fine of not to exceed $2,500, along with being responsible for the cost of
any and all repairs and the liability thereof, court costs and attorney's fees.
Each day the applicant does not obtain the necessary permit may also be treated
as a separate violation. Each and every occurrence may be treated as a separate
violation.

location showing lot boundaries, and by plans and specifications showing the
work to be done. In addition, a copy of a design release, issued by the State
Building Commissioner and the State Fire Marshal pursuant to IC 22-15-3-1 and a
complete set of plans, identical to those released for construction by the
Indiana Department of Fire and Building Services, shall be provided to the
Building Inspector before issuance of a permit for construction covered by such
design release, and a storm water drainage plan prepared by a design
professional, as defined in 675 IAC 12-6-2, section 2(d) of the Indiana General
Administrative Rules, shall be submitted to the Building Inspector and the Plan

original plans shall require the submission of amended plans identical to those
changes released for construction by the Indiana Department of Fire and
Building Services. The Building Inspector shall suspend or revoke a building
permit when it has been determined that submitted plans are not correct,
current, or are not identical to those released by the Indiana Department of
Fire and Building Services. No permit shall be issued for a project requiring a
construction design release by the Indiana Department of Fire and Building
Services unless a Plan Authentication Agreement Form, as the same has been

one-and-two-family dwelling code as well as other applicable statutes and
ordinances. In no case shall the resultant drainage changes adversely affect
the public drainage system or neighboring properties.

conditions:
         (a)   Signs which contain, include or are illuminated by any flashing,
intermittent or moving light(s) are prohibited.
         (b)   Signs which are not effectively shielded as to prevent beams or
rays of light from being directed at any portion of a street or roadway and

vision of the driver of any motor vehicle, or which otherwise interfere with
any driver's operation of a motor vehicle, are prohibited.
         (c)   No sign shall be so illuminated that it interferes with the
effectiveness of or obscures an official traffic sign, device or signal.

historic value and outstanding architectural design. This area is of great
importance to the social, economic, and general welfare of the city and should
be protected.
   (B)   It is the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the heritage of the
city by establishing a historic district. The chapter shall establish the means
of protecting the district's natural and man-made heritage while providing
guidelines for compatible new architectural development. It is the intent of
the chapter to stabilize and improve property values within the district, to
foster civic beauty and improvements, to strengthen the local economy, and to
promote the use of the historic district for the education, pleasure, and
welfare of the citizens of the city, state, and nation in accordance with the
regulations set forth herein.

shall consult with the Board of Review at the Board's request about this
problem.

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 151.30 CONSIDERATIONS OF BOARD.
   It is not the intent of this chapter to discourage new construction or other
development, nor to limit it to any one period of architectural style, but to
preserve the integrity of the historic buildings and to ensure the
compatibility of any new work constructed in the historic district. In making
its decisions, the Board shall consider the effects of proposed alterations or
construction on both the individual structure involved and on the neighborhood
surrounding the structure. The Board shall also consider the Madison Design
Review Guidelines, contained in Appendix A, specifically pages 35-139. The
Board may amend the Guidelines from time to time subject to approval by the
Common Council.

§ 151.31 PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS.
   A building or structure, classified as historic, and any appurtenance
related thereto, including but not limited to stone walls, fences, iron work,
steps, and signs, shall only be moved, reconstructed, altered, or maintained in
a manner that will preserve the historical and architectural character of the
building, structure, or appurtenance thereto. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed so as to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior
elements of any building or structure within the historic district.
(Ord. 1982-12, passed 7-31-82; Am. Ord. 1987-12-B, passed 7-21-87)
§ 151.32 DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Whenever a property owner shows that a building is incapable of
earning an economic return on its value, and the Board of Review fails to
approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, such building may be
demolished; provided, however, that before a demolition permit is issued,
notice of proposed demolition shall be given as follows:
      (1)   For buildings rated historic: 12 months.
      (2)   For buildings nonrated: 2 months.
   (B)   Notice shall be posted on the premises of the building or structure
proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible from the street. In
addition, notice shall be published in a newspaper of general local circulation
at least three times prior to demolition, the final notice of which shall be
not less than 15 days prior to the date of the permit, and the first notice of
which shall be published not more than 15 days after the application for a
permit to demolish is filed. The purpose of this subchapter is to further the
purposes of this chapter by preserving historic buildings which are important
to the education, culture, traditions, and the economic values of the city, and
to afford the city, interested persons, historical societies, or organizations,
the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of such
buildings. The Board of Review may at any time during such stay approve a
certificate of appropriateness in which event a permit shall be issued without
further delay.
   (C)   Criteria for the Board to consider in the case of a proposed
demolition:
      (1)   The Board shall determine whether the building is in such a state
of deterioration and disrepair or so structurally unstable as to make
preservation, restoration, or rehabilitation impracticable.
      (2)   The Board shall determine whether the removal of such a building
would be detrimental to the character of the historic district, balancing the
interest of the public in preserving the integrity of the district with the
interest of the owner of the building in the use and utilization of the
property.
      (3)   The Board shall take into account possible alternatives to
demolition, and should apprise the owner of the building of such alternatives.

configuration, building material, texture, and location on a lot as will be
compatible with other buildings and spaces in the historic area, particularly
with buildings designated as historic.

places to which they are visually related generally in terms of the following
factors:
   (A)   Height. The height of proposed buildings shall be visually compatible
with adjacent buildings.

width of the windows to height of windows in a building shall be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which the building is
visually related.
   (D)   Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of solids
to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually compatible with
buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
   (E)   Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of the
building to open space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually
compatible to the buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related.

§ 151.36 SIGNAGE.
   (A)   All new signage or alterations to signage within the historic district
shall be required to receive a certificate of appropriateness unless otherwise
noted within these regulations. No certificate of appropriateness shall be
required for a change of copy on a sign, the customary use of which involves
frequent and periodic changes of copy; the Board of Review shall indicate at
the time that a certificate of appropriateness is initially granted for such a
sign that the sign is of a type that has frequent and periodic changes of copy.
A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required to conduct ordinary
maintenance or repair of any sign within the historic district; however, no
sign shall be reworded, redesigned, or altered in any way other than ordinary
maintenance or repair unless the sign is brought into conformity with the
ordinance, and a certificate of appropriateness is obtained. Change of message
or design of a sign is not ordinary maintenance of a sign.
   (B)   Purpose. The necessity of signs is recognized for identification and
successful conduct of a business, service, or profession and to direct and
control traffic on the streets and to note points of public interest; use and
control of signs is of great importance. Therefore, the purpose of these
regulations is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by regulating
signs within the historic district. It is intended to protect property values,
create a more attractive economic and business climate, preserve the dignity
and architectural significance of the district, preserve its scenic and natural
beauty, and provide a more enjoyable and pleasing community for its residents.

required.
         (a)   Signs of duly constituted governmental bodies, including traffic
or similar regulatory devices, and legal notices.
         (b)   Flags or emblems identifying the political, civic,
philanthropic, educational, or religious organizations located on the premises.
         (c)   Memorial plaques, cornerstones, historical tablets, markers, and
the like, unless one face exceeds six square feet in surface area.
         (d)   Signs not visible off the lot.
         (e)   Signs posted in conjunction with doorbells or mailboxes.
         (f)   Signs required to be posted or maintained by law or government
order, rule, or regulation, unless specifically prohibited, limited, or
restricted.
         (g)   Signs displayed strictly for the direction, safety, or

the nineteenth century, are encouraged. Materials such as extruded aluminum and
plastics may not be appropriate.
         (f)   Whenever the Building Inspector determines a sign to be
structurally unsafe through lack of proper maintenance or for other reasons, or
endangers the safety of the building or endangers the public safety, the
Building Inspector shall order that such sign be made safe or removed. Such
order shall be complied with within 30 days of the receipt thereof by the
person owning or using the sign or the owner of the building or premises on
which such a sign is affixed or erected.
         (g)   The Historic District Board of Review may enact guidelines as to
sign shapes, colors, sizes and types of lettering, messages, and other sign
features which it finds are acceptable throughout the historic district. If the
Building Inspector finds that the sign meets all the criteria specified in the
general rules set up by the Board for approved signage, the Building Inspector
may issue a certificate of appropriateness without bringing that sign before
the historic district Board of Review.
      (5)   (a) Procedure. Before a sign is constructed, erected, or altered,
it must receive a certificate of appropriateness, unless the sign is exempted
under division (B) above. Procedures for applications, issuing certificates and

between such a sign and the curb.
         (b)   Each applicant shall, upon request of the Building Inspector,
submit any additional information deemed necessary. Detailed drawings drawn to
scale are not required; however, if the above requirements are not met, and if
the Board finds that as a result of a failure to meet these requirements, it
has insufficient informat-ion with which to make a decision, it may further
find that the application is incomplete and that the application not be
considered until such time as the application becomes complete.
      (6)   Nonconforming signs. Signs of a nonconforming nature which were
legally installed at the time of passage of this chapter may continue to exist
under the regulations and conditions as set forth in Sections 10.00 through
10.60 of the 1981 Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison, Indiana, provided,
however, that none of those sections may be interpreted to permit a rewording,
redesigning, or an altering of the signs in any way unless they are brought
into conformity with this chapter.

improvements as permissible uses throughout the historic district without a

without bringing such improvement before the Board of Review for a vote, unless

   The definition of an unsafe building contained in IC 36-7-9-4 is hereby
supplemented to provide minimum standards for building condition or maintenance
in the city by adding the following to the definition: Any building or
structure which has any or all of the conditions or defects hereinafter
described shall be deemed to be an unsafe building, provided that such
conditions or defects exist to the extent that life, health, property, or
safety of the public or its occupants are endangered:
   (A)   Whenever any door, aisle, passageway, or other means of exit is not of
sufficient width or size or is not so arranged as to provide safe and adequate
means of exit in case of fire or panic.
   (B)   Whenever the stress in any materials, member, or portion thereof, due
to all dead and live loads, is more than one and one-half times the working
stress or stresses allowed for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or
location.
   (C)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire, earthquake,
wind, flood, or by any other cause, to such an extent that the structural
strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was before such
catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of
similar structure, purpose, or location.
   (D)   Whenever any portion, member, or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property.
   (E)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance, or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for such buildings.
   (F)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled, or settled
to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less
resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction.
   (G)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof, because of
dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction; the removal,
movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose
of supporting such a building; the deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its
foundation; or any other cause, is likely to partially or completely collapse.
   (H)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used.
   (I)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members list,
lean, or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the center
of gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third of the base.
   (J)   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the foundation, shows
33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members, or 50%
damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, or enclosing or outside
walls or coverings.
   (K)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind,
earthquake, or flood or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to become
an attractive nuisance to children, or freely accessible to persons for the
purpose of committing unlawful acts.
   (L)   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists, or is
maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable
to such building or structure provided by the building regulations of this
city, or of any law or ordinance of this state or city relating to the
condition, location, or structure of buildings.
   (M)   Whenever any building or structure which, whether or not erected in
accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any non-supporting
part, member, or portion less than 50%, or in any supporting part, member, or
portion less than 66% of the strength, fire-resisting qualities or
characteristics, or weather- resisting qualities or characteristics required by
law in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height, and
occupancy in the same location.
   (N)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangements, inadequate light, air, or
sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the city to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
   (O)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas
connections, or heating apparatus, or other cause, is determined by the city to
be a fire hazard.
   (P)   Whenever any portion of the building or structure remains on a site
after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever
any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six months so
as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive nuisance or
hazard to the public.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Madison does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Madison are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the City by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15)
§ 156.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15)
§ 156.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “A ZONE.” Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   Zone A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   Zone AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   Zone AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   Zone AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   Zone AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   Zone A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE” (“APPURTENANT STRUCTURE”). A structure with a floor
area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as
the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “BASE FLOOD.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   “BOUNDARY RIVER.” The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   “BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY.” The floodway of a boundary river.
   “BUILDING.” see "STRUCTURE."
   “COMMUNITY.” A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.
   “D ZONE.” Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   “DEVELOPMENT.”
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   "DEVELOPMENT" does not include activities such as the maintenance
of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   “ELEVATED STRUCTURE.” A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid
foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain
walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   “ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.” A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   “EMERGENCY PROGRAM.” The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   “FEMA.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   “FLOOD.” A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).” The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   “FLOOD PRONE AREA.” Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See "FLOOD")
   “FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).” The elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see "FREEBOARD")
   “FLOODPLAIN.” The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake,
or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   “FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.” Shall be the city Building Inspector.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   “FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).” A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   “FRINGE.” Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   “HARDSHIP” (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
City of Madison Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURES.” Any structure that meets any of the following:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register; or
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local register of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   “SUSPENSION.” The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   “VARIANCE.” A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   “VIOLATION.” The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

§ 156.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

§ 156.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the City of Madison, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

§ 156.29 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
156.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/ improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in this subchapter (§§
156.25 through
156.32) have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at Pt. 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.30 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
156.25 through
156.32 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15)
§ 156.31 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
156.25 through
156.32 of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
156.25 through
156.32 of this chapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 3-2015, passed 3-17-15) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.32 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
156.25 through
156.32 of this chapter.
