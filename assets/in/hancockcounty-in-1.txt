titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Hancock
County Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances”

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section

   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing ordinances refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official

are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that entity are
or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board, bureau,

provides. The repeal of any section shall not extinguish or release any
penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under the section, unless the

§ 34.15 ASSET CAPITALIZATION AND INVENTORY POLICIES.
   (A)   The Board believes it is appropriate to establish a county asset
policy with the following purpose:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the taxpayers of Hancock County;
      (2)   To comply with the standards of the Government Accounting
Standards; Board Statement 34;
      (3)   To fix responsibility for the custody of the assets;
      (4)   To maintain accurate records of all capital assets that are
capitalized, including infrastructure;
      (5)   To provide data for financial reporting for increased accuracy and
clarity; and
      (6)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (B)   Definition of capital assets.
      (1)   Capital assets are defined as assets having a useful life of more
than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more. Capital assets include
land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, machinery and
equipment, vehicles, construction work in progress, works of art, historical
treasures, and infrastructure, the latter of which are long-lived capital
assets that normally are stationary in nature and normally can be preserved for
a significant number of years more than most capital assets.
      (2)   All items with a useful life of more than one year and a cost of
$5,000 or more shall be capitalized, including acquisitions by lease-purchase
agreements and donated items. All land will be capitalized but not depreciated.
Construction work in progress will be included in the capital asset inventory
and will be depreciated once the project is complete and transferred to the
appropriate county department. Items costing less than $5,000 that are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of the original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit, or that prolong a capital
asset's economic life or expand its usefulness, will be included in the cost of
the larger unit.
      (3)   All capital assets meeting the criteria will be included in the
county's capital asset inventory and reported in the county's financial
statements. Assets that are not capitalized are expensed in the year of
acquisition. Departments must maintain an inventory of capital assets under
their supervision.
   (C)   Capitalization threshold and inventory.
      (1)   Capital threshold.
         (a)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting
purposes, an item must be at or above the capitalization threshold and have a
cost greater than $5,000. The cost of the asset will include all expenses
necessary to make the asset fully operational. Assets acquired through lease
purchase agreements that meet these specifications are to be capitalized. This
cost will be determined as the present value of discounted value of the future
stream of lease payments, and not the total lease.
         (b)   Capital assets are recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction cost of the asset but may also
include any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the asset in
its intended location and intended use, including:
            1.   Legal and title fees and closing costs;
            2.   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying costs;
            3.   Land preparation costs, demolition fees;
            4.   Architect, engineering and accounting fees; and
            5.   Transportation charges.
         (c)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at the fair
market value on the date donated. If no cost is available for a capital asset,
a replacement cost or a historic cost index may be used. Items that do not meet
the definition of capital assets are to be expensed in the year the asset is
acquired.
      (2)   Capital assets valuation. Capital assets are defined by the
following categories:
         (a)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or
acreage including rights-of-way owned by Hancock County.
         (b)   Buildings and improvements. All structures designed and erected
to house equipment, services, or functions are included. This includes systems
and fixtures within the buildings and attachments such as stairs, fire escapes,
canopies, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and other items that serve the
building. Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating and
air handling systems, sound systems, surveillance systems, elevators, built-in
casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving and other fixed
equipment are included in building components.
         (c)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical
property, such as mechanical equipment, heavy equipment, office furniture,
appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication
equipment, laboratory equipment, and data processing equipment and software.
Supplies that typically get used within one year are not included.
         (d)   Vehicles. Motor vehicles include all vehicles for which title
and license must be obtained including cars, trucks, buses, road-going
trailers, dump trucks, and highway trucks. Vehicle accessories will be
identified as a component asset of the vehicle to which they are attached.
         (e)   Infrastructure. Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital
assets that normally can be preserved for a significantly greater number of
years than most capital and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples
include roads, bridges, storm water and drainage systems.
   (D)   Responsibilities for inventory and reporting of capital assets.
      (1)   Responsibilities of county departments.
         (a)   Department heads are the stewards for each piece of property
utilized by their department. The steward will be the focal point for questions
of availability, condition, and usage of the asset.
         (b)   The steward shall be designated as the person to record the
receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure no damage was incurred
during shipment, and to make sure the asset was received in working order. The
steward is also responsible for arranging the necessary preventative
maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working condition. The
steward also ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it was
acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. The steward is
responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the assets.
      (2)   Minor but sensitive assets. 
         (a)   Departments are to maintain inventories of all capital assets,
including:
            1.   Those that are capitalized and reported on the county's
capital asset inventory; and
            2.   Controllable assets with an acquisition cost of $4,999 or less
and which are tracked and inventoried.
         (b)   Department heads are to report newly acquired assets, retired
assets, transferred assets, and assets in use that previously were not included
in the county's asset inventory to the Hancock County Auditor's Office.
Department heads are required to use the Auditor's Office prescribed forms and
to meet with the Auditor's Office, or its designee, if necessary for the proper
preparation of the capital asset reports. Department heads must abide by all
Auditor Office deadlines for reporting. Typically, asset reporting is to be
completed by the first Friday of the first full week in January of each year.
         (c)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered
sensitive may include, but are not limited to, weapons, radios, computers,
chain saws, small motor equipment and power tools. These minor but sensitive
items shall be inventoried and controlled at the department level by the head
of the operating department. Stated inventory shall be conducted annually. The
County Auditor’s Office is to receive a copy of the inventory and/or undated
inventories for minor but sensitive items.
         (d)   Department heads are responsible for ensuring that acquisitions
of capital assets follow all policies statutes and regulations, including
proper advertising, use of proper budgetary codes and accounting forms, and all
required appropriation approvals.
         (e)   The Hancock County Commissioners and the Auditor’s Office may
conduct spot checks of the asset inventory and condition on a random,
unannounced basis.
      (3)   Responsibilities of the County Auditor’s Office. The Auditor’s
Office is responsible for ensuring that accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory that is updated annually
for additions, retirements, transfers, and items retroactively added. The
Auditor’s Office is responsible for securing a capital asset advisor for the
county, if deemed necessary, and for the financial reporting of the capital
assets, including depreciation expense and assets included in the inventory but
not depreciated.
   (E)   Depreciation methods. Hancock County will depreciate capital assets by
using the straight-line method. Salvage value will be determined on an asset-
by-asset basis. Assets will be depreciated based on the estimated useful life
of each asset. The following are the estimated useful lives for each asset
class:
      (1)   Buildings: 50 years;
      (2)   Infrastructure being depreciated: 50 years;
      (3)   Building components and improvements: 20 to 50 years;
      (4)   Machinery and equipment: 5 to 15 years; and
      (5)   Vehicles: 5 to 10 years.

SCHEDULE VIII. INTERSECTIONS WITH TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (A)   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting
different colored lights or colored lighted arrows successively, one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, or yellow may be used.
   (B)   The lights indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians
as follows:
      (1)   Green indication means the following:
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at the place prohibits
either turn.
         (b)   Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent sidewalk at the time the signal is
exhibited.
         (c)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the green arrow or other movement permitted
by other indications shown at the same time.
         (d)   Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
         (e)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing a green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn
arrow, may proceed across the roadway within a marked or unmarked crosswalk.
      (2)   Steady yellow indication means the following:
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is warned that the related green movement is being terminated and
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         (b)   A pedestrian facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, is advised
that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is
shown, and a pedestrian may not start to cross the roadway at that time.
      (3)   Steady red indication means the following:
         (a)   Except as provided in division (B) below, vehicular traffic
facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line. However, if there is no clearly marked stop line, vehicular traffic shall
stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection. If
there is no crosswalk, vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown.
         (b)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn described in
this division, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after coming to a
complete stop, may cautiously enter the intersection to do the following:
            1.   Make a right turn.
            2.   Make a left turn if turning from the left lane of a one-way
street into another one-way street with the flow of traffic. Vehicular traffic
making a turn described in this division shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic using
the intersection.
         (c)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone may not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   No indication or conflicting indications means the following:
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing an intersection having a signal that
displays no indication or conflicting indications, where no other control is
present, shall stop before entering the intersection.
         (b)   After stopping, vehicular traffic may proceed with caution
through the intersection and shall yield the right-of-way to traffic within the
intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
      (5)   This division applies to traffic control signals located at a place
other than an intersection. A stop required under this division must be made at
the signal, except when the signal is supplemented by a sign or pavement
marking indicating where the stop must be made.
   (C)   The following intersections have traffic control signals governed by
this schedule:

or more than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of
service to subscribers, or a subscriber density less than the density specified
herein, in order to prevent inequitable burdens on potential cable subscribers

campaigns of the company.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Board of Commissioners of Hancock County does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2007-11A, passed 11-5-07; Am. Ord. 2013-12C, passed 1-7-14; Am. Ord.
2024-7A, passed 7-2-24)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Unincorporated Hancock County are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2007-11A, passed 11-5-07; Am. Ord. 2013-12C, passed 1-7-14; Am. Ord.
2024-7A, passed 7-2-24)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.

2024-7A, passed 7-2-24)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which

flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source (see FLOODPLAIN).
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in

equivalent to the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map,
measured from the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth is specified, two
feet is used as the minimum depth (see FREEBOARD).
   FLOOD-RELATED EROSION. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of
a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a

compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE OR FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Hancock
County Board of Commissioners requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or directly
by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified and installed.
   LATTICE WORK. See BREAKAWAY WALL.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

      (5)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR § 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.

structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are

ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

§ 152.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Hancock County delineated as an "AE
Zone" on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
Hancock County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007, as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied SFHA designated as an "AE Zone," the
limits of the floodway will be according to the best available flood layer as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Hancock County, delineated as an "A
Zone" on the Hancock County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review, subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.24 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
152.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and meeting
requirements of Article 4, Section E(1). A Conditional Letter of Map Revision
cannot be issued for development that would cause an increase in flood levels
affecting a structure and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) Hancock County shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

following situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of any structure having a floor area
greater than 400 square feet.
      (2)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land). An addition and/or
improvement project that is continuous in scope or time is considered as one
project for permitting purposes.
      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred (the costs of any proposed additions or
improvements beyond restoring the damaged structure to its before damaged
condition must be included in the cost).
      (4)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for

vertical;
         (d)   Fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      (3)   A residential structure may be constructed using a stem wall
foundation (also called chain wall, raised-slab-on-grade, and slab-on-stem-
wall-with-fill). Any backfilled stem wall foundation (also called chain wall,
raised-slab-on-grade, and slab-on-stem-wall-with-fill) must be backfilled with
compacted structural fill, concrete, or gravel that supports the floor slab. No
flood openings are required for this type of construction.
   (C)   Non-residential structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,

§ 152.29 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure.
General licenses and exemptions to the requirements of the Flood Control Act
(I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to qualified additions/improvements to
existing lawful residential structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland
restoration, utility line crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and
prospecting.
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
   (C)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundreths of one foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the Floodplain Administrator shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR §
65.12.
   (E)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
152.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (see I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
   (F)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than an
approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for a general
license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/project.

obtain the proper forms and initiate the permit process.
   (G)   Prior to submitting any of the materials required by this chapter, the
applicant or his or her representative may discuss with the County Highway
Department the nature of the improvement being
proposed. At that time, the applicant may be instructed concerning the
classification of his or her permit and what regulatory procedures apply to it
and must be followed under this chapter in order to secure approval.
   (H)   Driveway permits have been separated into four types, which are
commercial major, commercial minor, commercial sub-minor, and private in order
to reference the driveway permit application to appropriate policies,
procedures and standards. Each type is defined and discussed in detail as
follows:
      (1)   A commercial major driveway permit is for approaches that connect
the county road to private property used for commercial purposes or to a public
property, and attract sufficient traffic to warrant an auxiliary lane(s), as
determined by the County Engineer. The location for this type can be in either
an urban or rural area. It can also be designated as either a Class III or IV
driveway approach.
      (2)   A commercial minor driveway permit is for approaches that connect
the county road to private property used for commercial purposes, or to a
public property, and do not attract sufficient traffic to warrant an auxiliary
lane(s), as determined by the County Engineer. The location for this type can
be in either an urban or a rural area. It can also be designated as either a
Class III or IV driveway approach.
      (3)   A commercial sub-minor driveway permit is for approaches that
connect the county road to private property used for commercial purposes, and
do not attract more than 25 vehicles per day, as determined by the County
Engineer. The location of this type can be in either an urban or rural area. It
can also be designated as either a Class I or II driveway approach.
      (4)   A private driveway permit is for approaches that connect the
highway to private property having a residence, barn, or private garage, in
improved or unimproved condition, used by the owner or occupant of the
premises, guests, and necessary service vehicles. The location for this type of
driveway can be in either an urban or a rural area. It can also be designated
as either a Class I, II, or V driveway approach.
      (5)   The type of approach is to be shown on the application form by the
applicant and approved by the County Engineer. The type of approach will be
determined by the definitions provided in subsections (1) through (4) above and
by information provided by the applicant from the following:
         (a)   The results of a traffic impact study; and
         (b)   Warrants for auxiliary lanes in accordance with the Indiana
Department of Transportation (INDOT) Driveway Permit Manual, latest edition.
   (I)   Other activities within a county right-of-way which require a permit
are as follows:
      (1)   Utility work, which shall include the following:
         (a)   Utility pull-off drives, which are defined as drives which are
installed only for access to a normally unmanned utility appurtenance, such as
a vault, where occasional maintenance or observation is required. Any drive
installed to serve a utility facility which is open to the public, or which has
a full-time staff, shall be considered and permitted as a commercial driveway;
         (b)   Open cut, push or bore within a right-of-way;
         (c)   Placement of utility poles; and
         (d)   Attachment to a county bridge.
      (2)   A non-utility open cut within a right-of-way;
      (3)   Non-utility borings or pushes under county roads;
      (4)   Oversize/overweight vehicles; and
      (5)   House moving. This does not apply to:
         (a)   Mobile homes or manufactured housing that have been approved for
moving by the state; or
         (b)   Agricultural buildings weighing less than 10,000.
            1.   A person shall not move a building or structure that
temporarily obstructs or crosses a county road or highway unless the person
first files an application for permit and receives an approved permit from the
County Highway Department. The application shall include a traffic control plan
approved by the County Sheriff or his or her designated representative.
            2.   Prior to the approval of any request to move a building or
structure, the applicant must post with the County Highway Department a surety
bond, irrevocable letter of credit or insurance policy payable to the County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of no less than $30,000 to indemnify and
protect the county from any damage to the roads or highways arising out of the
move, or any other liability.
            3.   The Highway Department shall consider and approve the
application unless the County Engineer considers the bond insufficient to
adequately indemnify the county for any damages that may arise from moving the
building. The County Engineer may then request that an additional surety bond
be posted. Additional surety will be required if the move exceeds any bridge
load rating. Approval may also be withheld if the route, traffic control or
time of the move is found to be unacceptable by the County Engineer or his or
her designated representative.
            4.   An applicant under this shall submit a non-refundable fee of
$150 with the applicant’s permit and bond. Check or money order shall be made
payable to the “Hancock County Treasurer” and deposited by the County Highway
Department With the County Auditor into the Motor Vehicle Highway Fund. This
fee may be waived at the discretion of the County Engineer if the applicant is
another governmental agency or a charitable organization which benefits the
county.
            5.   The approved permit shall be visibly posted on the structure
being moved while it is within the county road right-of-way.
            6.   Any permit denied by the County Highway Department may be
appealed by the applicant to the County Board of Commissioners.
   (J)   Applicants for any of the above activities shall be required to
complete the permit forms and documents and will be subject to plan review and
approval by the County Engineer, and the appropriate requirements of this
chapter.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.04 TYPES OF APPROACH CLASSES.
   (A)   Approaches are designated as belonging to one of the following five
classes.
 
Approach Class Type of Approach    Features
Class I        Private approach    Raised curb
Class II       Private approach    Shoulder only, no raised curb
Class III      Commercial approach Raised curb
Class IV       Commercial approach Shoulder only, no raised curb
Class V        Field approach      Compacted aggregate surface
 
   (B)   The location for a Class I approach is usually in an urban area. The
approach characteristics are constructed so that it is located on a roadway
bordered by curbs, and serves a private residence and improved property. A hard
pavement surface, curbs, enclosed drainage such as storm sewers, and sidewalks
are common elements in the construction of this approach.
   (C)   The location for a Class II approach is usually in a rural area. The
approach characteristics are constructed so that it is attached to the edge of
the county road pavement or improved hard surface shoulder and serves private
residences and improved property. A pipe continuing drainage along the county
road ditch line is a required element in the construction of this approach,
unless a variance is approved by the County Engineer.
   (D)   The location for a Class III approach is usually in an urban area. The
approach characteristics are constructed so that it is located on a roadway
bordered by curbs and serves a commercial establishment. A hard pavement
surface, curbs, enclosed drainage such as storm sewers, auxiliary lanes,
tapers, and sidewalks are common elements in the construction of this approach.
   (E)   The location for a Class IV approach is usually in a rural area. The
approach characteristics are constructed so that it is attached to the county
road edge of pavement and serves a commercial establishment. A hard pavement
surface, auxiliary lanes, and tapers are common elements in the construction of
these approaches. A pipe continuing drainage along the county road ditch line
is a required element in the construction of these approaches, unless a
variance is approved by the County Engineer.
      (1)   Approach edges for Class IV commercial minor driveway approaches
shall be connected to either tapers of a short auxiliary lane or to the county
road traveled way pavement with returns of adequate radii.
      (2)   Tapers which improve the ingress and egress turning movement
characteristics of the approach and which connect the radii returns to the
county road traveled way pavements are required when either of the following
criteria are met: (Counts must be collected or approved by the County
Engineer.)
         (a)   The highway ADT is greater than 3,000 vehicles per day; or
         (b)   The approach ADT is greater than 40 vehicles per day.
      (3)   Tapers will not be required for those commercial drives whose
conditions will not exceed the criteria of subsections (a) and (b) above. In
these instances, approach edges may be connected to the highway traveled way
with returns of radii only.
   (F)   The location for a Class V approach is either in an urban or rural
area. The main characteristics are that it serves a vacant lot, field, or
unimproved property and draws only an occasional vehicle and is typically not a
permanent drive. A graded, compacted aggregate surface and a pipe continuing
drainage along the highway ditch line are required elements in the construction
of this approach, unless a variance is approved by the County Engineer.
   (G)   (1)   All classes of approaches, except Class V, shall install a
mailbox approach in compliance with Figure 1 when the following conditions are
met:
         (a)   The existing road has mailbox approaches.
         (b)   The existing road has adequate shoulder area in the public
right-of-way.
      (2)   The construction cost associated with the mailbox approach shall be
included in the amount of the bond for the driveway approach.
      (3)   The location of the mailbox approach shall be determined by the
U.S. Postal Service.

(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99; Am. Ord. 2005-11E, passed 11-28-05)
§ 153.05 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Criteria regarding the location, spacing, sight distance, and other
features regarding the design of driveways shall be in accordance with the
following publications and regulations:
      (1)   Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) Driveway Permit
Manual, latest edition;
      (2)   The INDOT Design Manual; and
      (3)   The minimum standards for auxiliary lanes shall be in accordance
with
Chapter 155. These criteria shall be minimum values. The County Engineer may
require the use of higher criteria when significant traffic volumes, a large
percentage of truck traffic, or other factors, as determined by the County
Engineer, are present.
   (B)   The applicant shall provide drainage information, including
development site plans and drainage calculations showing existing and proposed
drainage patterns, including existing contours, to the County Highway
Department with proof that there are no adverse effects to drainage patterns in
the vicinity caused by the development.
      (1)   If a drainage permit has been issued by the county for the proposed
development, then the information in this division will not be required. Class
V drives are also exempt from this requirement.
      (2)   Any diversion of water flow to the right-of-way shall be fully
identified and explained. There shall not be any increase to flows unless the
development drains to an adjacent stream of adequate capacity to convey the
augmented and future development drainage.
      (3)   If downstream drainage capacity is inadequate, the applicant shall
provide flow detention on the developed property. Absolutely no detention is
allowed on a county right-of-way. Detention structures and means of discharge
shall be adequately presented and explained on plans and in calculations
provided to the County Highway Department. The county strongly discourages the
use of orifice plates for the control structures. The preferred method is to
install a section of pipe of the appropriate size to restrict the flow.
      (4)   The 100-year developed property run-off rate shall not exceed the
ten-year undeveloped property run-off rate. Thus, the entire Q100 run-off shall
be detained on the property and released at the ten-year undeveloped property
run-off rate. These criteria shall be followed unless a local agency has a more
restrictive ordinance. The rational method for detention design may be used for
developments that are two acres or less in total size. Detention analysis for
developments larger than two acres shall be performed using a method that
generates hydrographs for both the inflow and the outflow.
      (5)   The minimum size opening for all drainage structures crossing under
two-lane county routes shall be 12 inches in diameter for round pipes or 1.1
square feet for deformed pipes. The minimum pipe sizes under driveway
approaches shall be 12 inches in diameter for round pipes or 1.1 square feet
for deformed pipes. All pipes with diameters from 12 inches to 36 inches shall
have pipe end sections appropriate for the type of pipe used. Pipes with
diameters greater than 36 inches shall have concrete anchors.
      (6)   The County Highway Department uses the following design frequencies
for any type of drainage structures on a highway:
         (a)   For arterial routes, a 50-year storm event design;
         (b)   For collector routes, a 50-year storm event design;
         (c)   For local routes, a 50-year storm event design;
         (d)   For driveways, a ten-year storm event design; and
         (e)   For side ditches, a ten-year storm event design.
      (7)   The Stormwater Drainage Manual published by the Highway Extension
and Research Project for Indiana Cities and Counties (HERPICC), now Indiana
Local Technical Assistance Program, or LTAP, provides considerable information
about the design of drainage structures.
      (8)   Adjustments to existing highway storm sewer structures may be
necessary, such as relocation of an inlet displaced by the driveway approach.
The relocated structure shall be compatible with those servicing the segment of
county road. The INDOT English Standard Sheet MD contains the design of
drainage structures commonly used along county roads.
      (9)   Minimum pipe structure materials shall be either corrugated steel
or reinforced concrete, Class III. Alternate materials may be used if approved
by the County Engineer.
      (10)   Minimum pipe size is 12 inches in diameter and 24 feet long. End
sections are required on culvert pipes.
      (11)   The table below is a guide. The applicant shall abide by the
manufacturer’s specifications for minimum and maximum cover in determining the
proper gauge.
 
Minimum Gauges For Steel Pipes
Pipe Thickness (Gauge)  For Pipe Diameters
0.064 inches (16 gauge) 12 inches through 21 inches
0.079 inches (14 gauge) 24 inches through 36 inches
0.109 inches (12 gauge) 42 inches through 60 inches
0.168 inches (8 gauge)  66 inches through 96 inches
 
      (12)   Pipes shall not be smaller than structures upstream from their
location.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.06 PLANS AND INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR COMMERCIAL MAJOR AND MINOR DRIVEWAY

§ 153.09 TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   (A)   A traffic impact analysis (TIA) is a specialized study of the impact
that a given type and size of new land use has on the nearby transportation
system.
   (B)   Developments having land use intensity greater than the threshold
values given in the table below will be required to prepare a traffic impact
analysis.
Threshold Values for Traffic Impact Analysis
Land Use Type Threshold Values
Threshold Values for Traffic Impact Analysis
Land Use Type Threshold Values
Residential   80 dwelling units
Retail        10,000 square feet
Office        25,000 square feet or 2 acres
Industrial    50,000 square feet or 3 acres
Educational   30,000 square feet or 250 students
Lodging       120 occupied rooms
Medical       30,000 square feet
 
   (C)   For developments that can not be grouped under the categories
mentioned in the above table, the requirement for providing a traffic impact
study will be decided by the County Engineer on the basis of his or her
engineering judgment. In addition, the County Engineer reserves the right to
request that a TIA be performed if, in his or her opinion, the proposed
development may create safety, operational, or other traffic related problems.
   (D)   The study shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer or
engineering firm that has submitted a statement of qualifications to the County
Engineer stating their qualifications and past experience on performing traffic
impact studies.
   (E)   If required, the traffic impact analysis shall be prepared in
accordance with the INDOT Applicant’s Guide to Traffic Impact Studies. Copies
can be obtained by contacting the following address:
   Indiana Department of Transportation
   Greenfield District
   Permit Section
   P.O. Box 667
   32 S. Broadway
   Greenfield, IN 46140-0667
   Telephone: (317) 462-7751
   Fax: (317) 462-7031
   (F)   The applicant shall pay to the Hancock County Highway Department a fee
to review the traffic impact analysis for driveway permits applied for after
August 1, 2002. The fee shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners but shall be the sum of $22.50 for each quarter-hour of review
until modified by resolution. The applicant may stipulate that he or she shall
be notified when review time has reached a specified amount.

8B, passed 8-1-02)
§ 153.10 ACCESS SIGNALIZATION.
   (A)   There may be an immediate or future need for a traffic signal at the
access point for high volume traffic generators such as shopping centers,
industrial plants, industrial parks, residential projects and similar
developments.
   (B)   When there may be a future need for a traffic signal as determined by
the county, the applicant will be required to sign a future traffic signal
covenant.
   (C)   If and when traffic generation at and by the development site meets
minimum warrants for a traffic signal installation as determined by the county,
a separate agreement shall be prepared by the county to be entered into by the
applicant which will give the property owner the permission for the
installation.
   (D)   Any present or future installation of a traffic signal will be the
responsibility of the applicant or subsequent property owner(s).
   (E)   The failure to sign the above mentioned agreement(s) may result in the
denial of the permit application.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.11 ACCESS CONTROL.
   (A)   Limiting access to a public road right-of-way is a desirable design
feature. The intent is to reduce the total area of vehicular conflict by
controlling and defining driveway openings. The frequency of conflicts is
reduced because the number of possible conflict points is limited to legal,
defined driveway openings. This enhances both the safety and capacity of the
highway as preference is given to the through traffic. Points of congestion,
such as major intersections or interchanges, can be kept clear and free of
additional traffic introduced by driveways close to the intersection or
interchange. Driveways for major development sites, which may eventually become
signalized, can be better situated with respect to traffic signal coordination.
The extent and effectiveness of access control will be reflective of whether
the county road section in question is in a rural, suburban or urban
environment.
   (B)   In consideration for the county granting a driveway permit(s), the
applicant may be required to sign an agreement to execute an access control
document conveying the access rights for the balance property frontage owned by
the applicant. This document will be recorded.
   (C)   Commercial developments located on the corner of a county arterial and
a county collector should be restricted to access on the collector only. Access
will be limited to a single drive per property unless frontage exceeds 400
feet. In addition, no access point shall be within 200 feet of any
intersection. When more than one driveway per frontage is necessary to
facilitate operations, site conditions, current traffic patterns and
engineering judgment should be used to make a decision. A property that has
more than one frontage on a county road may be allowed one driveway per
frontage.
   (D)   Location of driveways and spacing of driveways and sight distance
requirements shall be as stipulated in the INDOT Driveway Permit Manual, latest
edition.
   (E)   Driveways within platted subdivisions shall also be as approved in
conformance with the subdivision control regulations of
Chapter 155.
   (F)   Driveways into subdivisions are classified as commercial drives.
   (G)   Where there are several adjacent roadside establishments, each with
limited frontage or where there is a probability of this type of development,
consideration shall be given to constructing a frontage road for several
driveways so as to reduce the number of separate connections to the county
road. The decision on whether frontage roads will be required will be made by
the County Engineer, based on the data contained in the traffic impact study
prepared by the developer. Frontage roads that parallel the county road shall
be allowed access points at minimum intervals of 500 feet. Frontage roads
should be set back from the county road in a manner to allow adequate storage
for entering and exiting traffic.

§ 153.12 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   A performance bond shall be required with each application for a
driveway permit equal to the estimated cost of that part of the project on the
County Highway Department’s right-of-way. The County Engineer must approve the
amount, and the minimum amount of bond shall be as stipulated in
§ 153.03, or an amount as specifically set by appropriate County Highway
Department action.
   (B)   A bond in an appropriate amount may also be required on non-commercial
drives.
   (C)   The following are the categories for which the bond may be waived:
      (1)   Governmental agencies of political subdivisions on the federal,
state, county, city or town level reporting to elected officials;
      (2)   Churches, referring to communities of religious people professing
the same faith and observing the same ritual and ceremonies;
      (3)   Private and public institutions providing first grade or higher
education;
      (4)   Companies regulated by the State Public Service Commission while
performing normal maintenance or construction activities to railroad
facilities; and/or
      (5)   Any applicant whose approved permit will result in work solely for
the purpose of closing existing driveway approaches to the county highway
system from the property.
   (D)   These exemptions are not to be based upon the tax exempt or nonprofit
status of the applicant. A person or committee of persons elected by a group of
people does not necessarily qualify as a governmental agency.
   (E)   The applicants who are claiming an exemption should indicate so on the
permit application form.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.13 FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   For construction in a county right-of-way for which no performance
guarantee has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the
period of validity of the permit approval, the permit shall be considered null
and void. The county reserves the right to institute a suit to remove any work
and restore the right-of-way to its original condition and assess the cost to
the applicant.
   (B)   In those cases where a performance guarantee has been posted and the
improvements have not been installed prior to the expiration of the guarantee,
the county shall declare the guarantee to be in default and cause all
improvements to be installed according to the approved plans, regardless of the
extent of any building development at the time the guarantee is declared to be
in default.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.14 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Where the county finds that extraordinary hardships or practical
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or
the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
the variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations, and further provided that the county shall not approve
variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out;
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, or county drainage regulations as
interpreted by the Board of Commissioners; and
      (5)   The application for variance must be accompanied by a nonrefundable
fee of $100, or as amended in the most recent schedule of fees.
   (B)   In approving variances, the county may impose conditions which will,
in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or
requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   A petition for any variance shall be submitted in writing by the
applicant at the time when the application for a driveway permit is filed. The
petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts
relied upon by the petitioner.
   (D)   Approval of variances will be given by the County Commissioners, with
benefit of a recommendation from the County Engineer.
   (E)   Variances to regulations regarding driveway pipes, including driveways
proposed with no driveway pipe, such as at the crest of a hill, shall be exempt
from these variance provisions. However, written approval will be required from
the County Engineer in those situations.
(Ord. 1999-6E, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.15 INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   All work done under permits issued under this chapter are subject to
inspection and approval by the county. All permits shall be submitted and
issued prior to commencing any construction activities. The County Highway
Department shall inspect all work being done on all improvements for each
permit issued to insure strict compliance with the standards and specifications
of this section and the permit. The inspection services do not include
construction engineering or construction stake-out, which are the sole

SIDEWALK REQUIREMENTS
§ 153.30 SIDEWALK APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any person, partnership, company, corporation, association or agency
intending to construct a sidewalk on the county’s right-of-way shall make
written application to and secure a permit from the County Highway Department.
This permit must be obtained before commencing construction on a sidewalk
within the right-of-way of a county highway and before obtaining a building
permit and an improvement location permit.
   (B)   A new sidewalk permit application shall be required when a relocation,
alteration or remodeling occurs on any premises where a sidewalk currently
exists in the county right-of-way. The granting or denial of the application
shall be governed by the same regulations and judged by the same standards as
an application for a permit for a wholly new sidewalk.
   (C)   Application to the County Highway Department shall be made on the form
as prescribed by the County Highway Department. The form and accompanying
documentation shall be submitted containing as many copies as may be prescribed
by the County Highway Department. The result shall be a permit application
package that completely and clearly describes and records the proposed work to
be performed on the county’s right-of-way by the applicant. It shall contain
plans, documents and other information on which to base a determination. It
must also provide a clear record that can be reviewed in future years for

(Ord. 2004-6C, passed 6-14-04)
§ 153.31 SIDEWALK PERMIT FORMS AND DOCUMENTS.
   The following forms and instructions for completing them can be obtained
from the County Highway Department. Providing complete and accurate information
on these forms is essential to expedite the permit processing.
   (A)   A document that initially is considered the application for a sidewalk
permit becomes the permit upon approval of the proposed sidewalk approach work.
It contains basic information on the first page of the form needed to locate
and record the permit work and lists standard general provisions on subsequent
pages. The form should be signed by the owner of the fee simple title. The
application fee shall be set by resolution of the Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   A document used to guarantee that work performed on the right-of-way
by the applicant will be completed as required by conditions and provisions of
the permit and shall be submitted with the application. The bonding company is
bound by the bond to see that the permit is completed satisfactorily should the
permittee fail to perform properly. The bond shall be approved by the Highway
Department and shall be sufficient to cover the work to be performed in the
right-of-way. The minimum bond shall be $3,000. In those cases where a
performance guarantee has been posted and the improvements have not been
installed prior to the expiration of the guarantee, the county shall declare
the guarantee to be in default and cause all improvements to be installed
according to the approved plans.
   (C)   Cash in the amount of the bond may be posted in lieu of a bond.
   (D)   The permits shall expire one year from the date of approval.
   (E)   An applicant must contact the County Highway Department in order to

immediate overbanks areas) that are believed to be subject to stream movement
or streambank erosion. These corridors have been delineated for most actively
migrating and relatively stationary streams in Indiana through an Indiana
Silver Jackets initiative. The corridor maps associated with the Hancock County

      SLOPE. Degree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal, measured as
a numerical ratio or percent. Expressed as a ratio, the first number is
commonly the horizontal distance (run) and the second is the vertical distance
(rise): e.g., 2:1. However, the preferred method for designation of slopes is
to clearly identify the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) components (length (L)
and width (W) components for horizontal angles). Also note that according to
international standards (metric), the slopes are presented as the vertical or
width component shown on the numerator: e.g., 1V:2H. SLOPE expressions in this
chapter follow the common presentation of slopes: e.g., 2:1 with the metric
presentation shown in parenthesis: e.g., (1V:2H). SLOPES can also be expressed
in "percent". SLOPES given in percent are always expressed as (100*V/H): e.g.,
a 2:1 (1V:2H) slope is a 50% slope.

and perforated pipe, for intercepting groundwater or seepage.
      SURFACE RUNOFF. Precipitation that flows onto the surfaces of roofs,
streets, the ground, and the like, and is not absorbed or retained by that
surface but collects and runs off.
      SWALE. An elongated depression in the land surface that is at least
seasonally wet, is usually heavily vegetated, and is normally without flowing
water. SWALES conduct stormwater into primary drainage channels and may provide
some groundwater recharge.
      TEMPORARY STABILIZATION. The covering of soil to ensure its resistance to
erosion, sliding, or other movement. The term includes vegetative cover,
anchored mulch, or other non-erosive material applied at a uniform density of

§ 154.103 BACKGROUND.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners of Hancock County, State of Indiana,
adopted Ord. 1997-3D in 1997, as amended by Ord. 2001-10E in October 2001,
which established "Storm Drainage, Erosion, and Sediment Control Ordinance of
Hancock County", commonly known as the "Hancock County Drainage Code", in order
to govern the control of runoff of stormwater and to protect, conserve and
promote the orderly development of the land in Hancock County and its water
resources. This code was primarily targeted at stormwater discharge quantity,
and erosion and sediment control.
   (B)   On December 8, 1999, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, was published in the Federal
Register. The NPDES program, as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean
Water Act, controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Phase II of NPDES requires permit
coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s) and for small construction activity that results in
the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre. This federal regulation
went into effect on March 10, 2003. In response to Phase II of NPDES, the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management enacted Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13)
and revised Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5).
   (C)   Under these new state and federal regulations, Hancock County was
required to establish a regulatory mechanism for regulating stormwater quality
management. Therefore, the "Hancock County Drainage Code" was further amended
in 2004 and later by Ord. 2005-12C in December 2005 (effective January 2006)
and then by Ord. 2018-11-A in October 2018 with a document that included then
new requirements for management of stormwater quality in addition to quantity
and other necessary updates.
   (D)   In December 2021, IDEM finalized two new permits, municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) general permit (MS4 GP) and construction stormwater
general permit (CSGP), which replaced the previous IDEM's Rule 13 and Rule 5.
These new permits require the county to update its stormwater management
ordinance to incorporate new requirements contained in the 2021 permits. The
2022 Comprehensive Stormwater Management Ordinance of Hancock County and its
companion document, the 2022 Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, incorporate the IDEM-required changes and other necessary periodic
updates.

§ 154.104 FINDINGS.
   The Hancock County Board of Commissioners finds that:
   (A)   Waterbodies, roadways, structures, and other property within and
downstream of Hancock County are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within Hancock County will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the Hancock County's waterbodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within Hancock County
will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely
affect Hancock County's waterbodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Preventing further encroachment into the FEH corridors will minimize
fluvial erosion hazards and property loss from flooding, enhance public safety,
maximize channel stability, and maintain or improve water quality and habitat
function;
   (I)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff, illicit discharges, and fluvial
erosion hazards;
   (J)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the protection of property,
preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of
our natural resources, and for compliance with state and federal regulations.
   (K)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the protection of mutual and
private drains.

§ 154.105 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of Hancock County through the regulation of
stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system and to
protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water
resources within Hancock County. This chapter establishes methods for managing
the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system in
order to comply with state and federal requirements. The objectives of this
chapter are:
   (A)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive
stormwater runoff;
   (B)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from construction site runoff;
   (C)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system
from runoff from new development and re-development;
   (D)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm drain system;
   (E)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

§ 154.112 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records,
engineering, and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or
stormwater runoff amounts may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land uses permitted will be free from stormwater
damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of any Hancock
County agency or any officer, representative, or employee. thereof, for any
damage which may result from reliance on this chapter or on any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (B)   The words "approve" and "accept", and their common derivations as used
in this chapter in relation to plans, reports, calculations, and permits shall
mean that Hancock County has reviewed the material produced and submitted by
the applicant or his/her agents for general compliance with this chapter and
the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and that such a
compliance would qualify the applicant to receive a stormwater management
approval or permit. Such an "approval" or "acceptance" is based on the
assumption that the project engineer has followed all appropriate engineering
methods in the design. Any stormwater quality or stormwater quantity (drainage)
problems associated with the project caused by poor construction by the
contractor and/or poor engineering design or judgment, either on-site or off-
site, are the responsibility of the developer and the project engineer.
   (C)   Consideration, design, construction, and maintenance of safety
measures for proposed or existing stormwater facilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer, applicant, and/or the property owner. The
Hancock County Government or its officials and representatives shall not be
responsible for maintenance and/or liable for any accidents resulting from
adequacy or lack of such safety measures.

discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.

§ 154.207 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. Hancock County has the authority to
periodically inspect that portion of the storm drainage system under Hancock
County's control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and
discharges into the system. This inspection will include a screening of
discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, Hancock County
may inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities
of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow Hancock County's
properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger
at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. Hancock
County or its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's
property the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection.
Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement
action as described in §§
154.701 et seq.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings, Hancock County has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this chapter.

  STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 154.301 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, commercial and industrial developments,
residential subdivisions, planned development, rural estate subdivisions, and
any redevelopment or other new construction located within Hancock County.
Hancock County Drainage Board and/or Hancock County Surveyor, after thorough
investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff
for minor subdivisions and parcelization. Additional potential exemptions
regarding the detention requirements are provided under this section.

§ 154.302 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving Hancock
County do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
(as defined in §
154.100) located within Hancock County. Control devices shall limit the
discharge to a rate such that the post-developed release rate from the site is
no greater than 0.1 cfs per acre of development for zero to ten year return
interval storms and 0.3 cfs per acre of developed area for 11 - 100 year return
interval storms. The above fixed general release rates may be set at a lower
value by the Hancock County Surveyor for geographical areas determined as
impact drainage area or for certain watersheds if more detailed data becomes
available as a result of comprehensive watershed studies conducted and/or
formally approved and adopted by the Hancock County Surveyor. Additional
details regarding the release rate requirements, available basin specific
release rates, downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet,
adjoining property impact considerations, fluvial erosion hazards
considerations, policy on dams and levees, and compensatory floodplain storage
rates are detailed in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

  § 154.304 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Regulated drainage easements (RDEs) are stormwater easements and
drainage rights-of-way that are dedicated to the public and trusted to Hancock
County Drainage Board for the sole and exclusive purpose of controlling surface
water and/or for the installation, operation, and maintenance of storm sewers
as defined in the Hancock County Stormwater Management Ordinance. These
drainage easements are established under authority of the Indiana Drainage Code
and the said Board may exercise powers and duties as provided in said code
(e.g., annual drainage assessment per lot). All other storm drainage easements
have not been accepted into the county's system.
   (B)   There shall be no trees or shrubs planted, nor any structures or
fences erected in any drainage easement, unless otherwise accepted by Hancock
County. All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way may be incorporated into the Hancock County system at the discretion of
Hancock County. The developer shall petition to incorporate the storm system
into the Hancock County system. The stormwater management approval shall not be
granted until such petition is submitted in a form accepted by Hancock County.
   (C)   If Hancock County accepts the petition for incorporation into their
system, the following statement shall become part of the restrictive covenants
of every platted subdivision and shown on recorded plat: "Channels, storm
sewers, inlets and outlets of detention and retention ponds, and appurtenances
thereto within designated regulated drainage easements (RDEs) are extensions of
the Hancock County stormwater drainage system and are the responsibility of
Hancock County Drainage Board. Specific definitions and requirements associated
with these RDEs and noted storm drainage systems are contained in this section
and in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Drainage
swales shall be the responsibility of owner or homeowner association."
   (D)   For petition to the county, the following statement shall be put on
each subdivision plat: "A petition addressed to the Hancock County Drainage
Board has been filed with the Drainage Board, requesting that the subdivision's
storm drainage system and its easements be accepted into the county's regulated
drainage system. The storm drainage system and its easements that are accepted
into the county's regulated drainage system are delineated on the plat as
regulated drainage easements (RDEs). All other drainage easements have not been
accepted into the county's system. All drainage improvements performed relative
to the conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof,
within the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or
homeowner association. Within the latter easements, the Hancock County Drainage
Board assumes no responsibility relative to said improvements or the
maintenance thereof. Specific definitions and requirements associated with
these RDEs and noted storm drainage systems are contained in Hancock County
Stormwater Management Ordinance and in Hancock County Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. This subdivision contains __ linear feet of open ditches and
__ linear feet of subsurface drains that will be included in the county's
regulated drainage system." The noted regulated drain lengths, broken down by
the length of open and tile drains, shall also be shown in tabular form in a
prominent position on the plat.
   (E)   Any outlet to, crossing, and/or encroachment of a regulated drainage
easement requires application and acceptance from the Hancock County Surveyor's
Office and/or Hancock County Drainage Board.
   (F)   All new channels, swales, drain tiles, inlet and outlet structures of
detention and retention ponds, and appurtenances thereto as required by this
chapter, that are installed on the municipal or school property will be
maintained, repaired, and constructed by the entity and will not become county
regulated drains. The design must meet the standards of the Hancock County
Stormwater Management Ordinance for sizing and installation. Any off-site
portion of the drainage system must be within easements and have clearly
defined maintenance agreements.
   (G)   Additional easement requirements along stormwater conveyance systems
and stormwater BMPs are contained in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical
Standards.

§ 154.307 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the stormwater management approval is granted (by Hancock
County) and the commencement of construction activities, Hancock County has the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approval. After
construction is complete, the Hancock County Surveyor will inspect the site and
provide written comments on items that need corrected. After items have been
corrected, the Surveyor's Office will re-inspect at no charge. However, if
there are ongoing inspections, there will be a charge of $250 per inspection
for two hours and each additional hour is $125 per hour.
   (B)   Hancock County also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the stormwater management approval, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except in accordance with the
stormwater approval, or in accordance with approved amendments or revisions to
the original stormwater management approval. If deficiencies are found during
the inspection, the owner of the facility will be notified by Hancock County
and will be required to take all necessary measures to correct such
deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed
time period, as specified in the Hancock County notification, Hancock County
will undertake the work and collect from the owner using bonds and/or lien
rights if necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than one lot or parcel shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property
deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and
determined before the final stormwater approval.

  STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 154.401 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Hancock County will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials
handling procedures, to be submitted as part of the construction plans and
specifications. Any project located within Hancock County which falls under the
jurisdictional authority of the Hancock County Drainage Board (both within and
outside of MS4 area) and includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land
disturbing activities resulting in the disturbance of one acre or more of total
land area is subject to the requirements of this chapter. This includes both
new development and re-development. This chapter also applies to disturbances
of less than one acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or
more acres of land, within the area under the jurisdictional authority of the
Hancock County Drainage Board. §
154.403 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) shall also be in compliance
with 327 IAC 15-5.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities.
   (C)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for stormwater management approval from Hancock County Drainage
Board or its designee, Hancock County Surveyor, and ensure that a sufficient
construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed and
submitted in accordance with §§
154.601 et seq.; regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger
permitted project site.
   (E)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than one acre, located
within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger
permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with the
terms and conditions of the stormwater approval for the larger project site.
The stormwater approval application for the larger project site must include
typical detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots. In
addition, these individual lots are required to submit individual lot plot plan
permit applications prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §§
154.601 et seq.
   (F)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater management approval application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to Hancock County in accordance
with §§
154.601 et seq. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to
ensure compliance with this chapter and the technical standards during the
construction activity and implementation of the construction plan, and to
notify Hancock County with a sufficient notice of termination letter upon
completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However, all persons
engaging in construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted project
site must comply with the requirements of this subchapter and this chapter as
well as the technical standards.

§ 154.402 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. The
developer must submit to Hancock County a SWPPP with detailed erosion and
sediment control plans as well as a narrative describing materials handling and
storage, and construction sequencing. This SWPPP must be site and project
specific. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated.
   (B)   Detailed requirements for stormwater pollution prevention on
construction sites within Hancock County, which are consistent with IDEM
minimum requirements and apply to all land-disturbing activities, are contained
in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

§ 154.403 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this chapter to the project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land-
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must
comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
      (3)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by the
permit, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as roads, utilities, or common
areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined
by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects
sites, such as industrial and commercial project sites, a minimum of one acre
of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance unless the
lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the "Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual" or the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The methods and procedures included in these two references are in
keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's
CSGP. A copy of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online
through IDEM.

§ 154.404 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following the granting of the stormwater management approval by
Hancock County and commencement of construction activities, Hancock County has
the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with
the provisions of this chapter, the technical standards document, the approved
stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual,
and the terms and conditions of the approval.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to Hancock County, shall perform
a written evaluation of the project site by the end of the next business day
following each measurable storm event. If there are no measurable storm events
within a given week, the site should be monitored at least once in that week.
Weekly inspections by the trained individual shall continue until the entire
site has been stabilized and a "verified" copy of the notice of termination has
been issued. The trained individual should look at the maintenance of existing
stormwater pollution prevention measures, including erosion and sediment
control measures, drainage structures, and construction materials storage/
containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning properly. The trained
individual should also identify additional measures, beyond those originally
identified in the stormwater pollution prevention plan, necessary to remain in
compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations.
   (C)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name of the
individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation, problems
identified at the project site, and details of maintenance, additional
measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed.
   (D)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this chapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (E)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to
Hancock County, Hancock County has the right to request complete records of
maintenance and monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution prevention
measures. All evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to
Hancock County, in an organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request.
   (F)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the Hancock County
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

  STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 154.501 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
154.401 et seq., the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be
submitted to Hancock County as part of the stormwater management permit
application, must also include post-construction stormwater quality measures.
These measures are incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and
are left in place following completion of construction activities to
continuously treat stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project
located within Hancock County which falls under the jurisdictional authority of
the Hancock County (both within and outside of MS4 area) and includes clearing,
grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities resulting in the
disturbance of one acre or more of total land area is subject to the
requirements of this chapter. This includes both new development and
redevelopment, and disturbances of less than one acre of land that are part of
a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will
ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, within the area under the
jurisdictional authority of Hancock County. In addition, regardless of the
amount of disturbance, Hancock County reserves the right to require pre-
treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions
contained in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities; or
      (3)   Construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale; or
      (4)   Single family residential developments consisting of four or less
lots; or
      (5)   A single-family residential strip development where the developer
offers for sale or lease without land improvements and the project is not part
of a larger common plan of development of sale; or
      (6)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; and
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater management approval application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to Hancock County in accordance
with §§
154.601 et seq. and the technical standards. It will be the responsibility of
the project site owner to ensure proper construction and installation of all
stormwater BMPs in compliance with this chapter and with the stormwater
management approval, and to notify Hancock County with a notice of termination
letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However,
all eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this subchapter
and this chapter.

 § 154.502 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, increased potential for streambank erosion downstream,
and increased concentrations of pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides,
greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new development and re-development
continues in Hancock County, measures must be taken to intercept and filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams,
and rivers. Through the use of best management practices (BMP) to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq), stormwater runoff
will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants
will be removed. Hancock County has adopted a policy that the control of
stormwater quality will be based on the management of total suspended solids
(TSS).
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of Hancock
County, is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of Hancock County, measures must be taken to minimize
the impact of such development or re-development on streambank erosion. Using
appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and slowly
release the channel protection volume (CPv), the volume and rate of runoff for
channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize increased
streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to Hancock County, a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that would show placement of appropriate BMP
(s) from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the Hancock County Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an Operation and
Maintenance Manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and
a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement
provided in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing
for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded
with the deed for the property on which the project is located. The noted BMPs
must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided
or referenced in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Practices other than those specified in the preapproved list may be utilized.
However, the burden of proof as to whether the performance and ease of
maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines provided in the
Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the
applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of
acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the Hancock County Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
   (D)   Requirements of this chapter and the technical standards with respect
to post-construction stormwater quality management can be satisfied through a
variety of methods broadly categorized under two general approaches:
      (1)   Conventional approach; and
      (2)   Low impact development (LID) approach.
   (E)   The site developer and designer are encouraged to review the LID
discussion in the technical standards prior to site design.
   (F)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under "hot spots" provision in the technical standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. These
requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities that
replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
§ 154.601 CONCEPTUAL DRAINAGE PLAN REVIEW.
   In order to gain an understanding of the drainage requirements for a
specific project, a developer may submit conceptual drainage plans and
calculations for review by the Hancock County Drainage Board and/or Hancock
County Surveyor. The direction provided by the Hancock County Drainage Board
and/or Hancock County Surveyor during such a review is based on preliminary
data and shall not be construed as an approval or binding on either party. The
following is a general listing of minimum data requirements for the review of
conceptual drainage plans:
   (A)   Two complete sets of conceptual plans showing general project layout,
including existing and proposed drainage systems (plan sheet sizing must be at
least 11 inches by 17 inches, but not to exceed 24 inches by 36 inches);
   (B)   General description of the existing and proposed drainage systems in
narrative form;
   (C)   Watershed boundaries shown on the best source of topographic
information available for the watershed area; and
   (D)   Existing watercourse(s) or regulated drains.

2022-10A, passed 10-4-22)
§ 154.602  PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This section applies to all development or re-development of land,
under the jurisdictional authority of the Hancock County, which results in land
disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land disturbance less
than one acre that are developed within a larger permitted project site should
refer to §
154.604 for plan review requirements and procedures.
   (B)   There are two scenarios for approval or permit application and
processing procedures. One process is followed for projects located within
unincorporated areas of Hancock County and the Town of Fortville; the other
process is for projects that impact Hancock County regulated drains but are
located within the jurisdictional areas of the incorporated towns and cities
within the county.
      (1)   Within unincorporated areas of Hancock County.
         (a)   For projects located within unincorporated areas of Hancock
County, the project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management approval to the Hancock County Surveyor. The application will
include a completed application checklist, construction plan sheets, stormwater
drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any
other necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
154.604 below. Two copies of each application must be submitted to the Hancock
County Surveyor. Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is
required in a format approved by the Hancock County Surveyor.
         (b)   If the project does not require Surveyor approval at a scheduled
meeting, the Hancock County Surveyor's Office will provide written comments and
sign the plans after Construction Approval has been granted. Once the plans
have been signed, and after a pre-construction meeting has been held,
construction can commence.
         (c)   The project site owner must notify the Hancock County Surveyor
and IDEM before beginning construction. Notification to the Hancock County
Surveyor shall be in the form of an email while notification to IDEM shall be
in the form of an online IDEM NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and
the pending construction notifications submitted to Hancock County Surveyor and
IDEM before the beginning of construction, construction may commence 48 hours
after the NOI is submitted to IDEM. Once construction starts, the project owner
shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution
prevention measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and
conditions of the stormwater management approval. Upon completion of
construction activities, a certification of completion and compliance and as-
built plans must be submitted to the Hancock County Surveyor in hardcopy and in
an electronic format compatible with the Hancock County geographic information
system (GIS). Once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a notification shall
be sent to the Hancock County Surveyor, requesting a termination inspection.
The Hancock County Surveyor, or representative, shall inspect the construction
site to verify that the completed project is fully stabilized and meets the
requirements of the Hancock County Stormwater Ordinance and its technical
standards as well as the terms and conditions of the approval. Once the
applicant receives a signed copy of the termination inspection checklist
confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM along with the required
IDEM NOT form. Permits issued under this scenario will expire five years from
the date of issuance. If construction is not completed within five years, an
updated permit application must be submitted to Hancock County Surveyor and an
updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least 90 days prior to expiration.
Figure_1-2018 is a flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval
process and can be found at the end of this chapter.
      (2)   Within other jurisdictional areas. For projects located within
other jurisdictional areas, but impacting Hancock County regulated drains, the
project site owner must submit two copies of the construction plans (which
include drainage plans), erosion and sediment control plans, and a stormwater
drainage technical report to the Hancock County Surveyor. Additionally, a
digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format approved by the
Hancock County Surveyor. If the project must go through a scheduled meeting,
all information must be submitted at least 30 days prior to its regularly
scheduled meeting. The Hancock County Surveyor shall furnish the applicant a
written list of objections to the plans and supporting data submitted by the
applicant. This list of objections, if any, will be related only to the
project's impact on Hancock County regulated drains. A resubmittal from the
applicant addressing the list of objections shall be provided to the Hancock
County Surveyor at least ten days prior to any required scheduled meeting.
Plans in substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the
technical standards that need to go through a scheduled meeting shall be placed
on the agenda. If the Hancock County Surveyor approves the project, the
applicant must satisfactorily address all issues listed in the conditional
approval to obtain construction approval. This approval does not alleviate the
applicant's responsibility to comply with this chapter, policy, or resolution
requirements of the local jurisdictional entity.

§ 154.603 SWPPP REVIEW TIME LIMITS.
   (A)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD must make a preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially complete before the
end of the tenth working day (for sites with less than five acres of land
disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with five acres or larger of
land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the review
authority. Depending on the outcome of the SWPPP review, the following
scenarios may play out:
      (1)   No SWPPP review notification received. If the review authority does
not notify the applicant of its preliminary determination as to whether the
construction plan is substantially complete within either ten or 14 days as
noted above, the project site owner may submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM
§§
154.601 et seq. including the information required by IDEM, or this chapter and
the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and 48 hours after
the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction project, including the
land disturbing activities of the construction project.
      (2)   SWPPP not substantially complete. If the review authority notifies
the applicant that the construction plan is not substantially complete, the
project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to IDEM until the
review authority makes a conclusive favorable determination concerning the
construction plan under the IDEM rule/permit, or this chapter and the Hancock
County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
      (3)   Unfavorable SWPPP. If the review authority notifies the applicant
that the construction plan is substantially complete; and makes a conclusive
unfavorable determination concerning the construction plan under IDEM rule/
permit, or this chapter and the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual, the project site owner may not submit a notice of intent letter to
IDEM.
      (4)   Preliminary SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
preliminary review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and
48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction
project, including the land disturbing activities of the construction project.
The plan review authority reserves the right to perform a comprehensive review
at a later date, and revisions may be required at that time.
      (5)   Conditional SWPPP review. If the review authority notifies the
applicant that the construction plan is substantially complete and a
conditional review has been completed, the project site owner may submit a
notice of intent letter to IDEM including the information required by IDEM, or
this chapter and the Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and
48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM, may begin the construction
project, including the land disturbing activities of the construction project
provided that the requirements included in the conditional review are
fulfilled.

County streams, as shown on the FEH maps created by the Indiana Silver Jackets
Fluvial Erosion Hazard Program or any updates, currently hosted on the Hancock
County GIS website;
            3.   Land within 75 feet of each bank of any ditch within the
Hancock County's regulated drainage system;
            4.   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any drain tile or
enclosed conduit within Hancock County's regulated drainage system; and
            5.   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, land within the inundation zone behind an existing or
proposed new dam assumed to be full of water to the top of the dam, and areas
protected from flooding by a levee.
         (b)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the Hancock County Surveyor.
         (c)   Specific requirements for development within impact drainage
areas are contained in Hancock County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Additional special terms and conditions for development within any impact
drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management approval.

a three-year maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with Hancock
County, prior to final project acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 25% of
the cost of the stormwater drainage system located outside the public road
right-of-ways, and in a form satisfactory to the Hancock County Surveyor and/or
the Hancock County Drainage Board's attorney in order to assure: that such
stormwater system installation was done according to standards of good
workmanship; that the materials used in the construction and installation were
of good quality and construction; that such project was done in accordance with
the accepted plans and this chapter; and that any off-site drainage problems
that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such project, will be
corrected if such drainage problems are determined by Hancock County to have
been caused by the development of such project. The bond or other acceptable
guarantee shall be in effect for a period of three years after the date of the
final project acceptance by Hancock County.
   (D)   To verify that all regulated drain tiles are functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such tile drains shall be
required, once following the completion of installation (including the
installation of all utility mains) and the second time before release of
maintenance bond. These visual recordings will be scheduled by Hancock County
and paid for by the developer. Notices shall be provided to Hancock County
within 72 hours following the completion of installation and again at least 60
days prior to the expiration date of the maintenance bond so that the noted
recordings may be scheduled. Reports summarizing the results of the noted
visual recordings shall be reviewed and accepted by Hancock County before the
plat is recommended for recording and again before maintenance bond would be
recommended to be released.

§ 154.611 VARIANCE POLICY.
   It is recognized that, from time to time, stormwater management design
professionals may need to deviate from policies, procedures, technical
standards, and design criteria adopted by the Hancock County Drainage Board.
This variance policy is provided to give the stormwater management design
professional guidance on what deviations from policies, procedures, technical
standards, and design criteria will necessitate a formal variance request. In
general, proposed deviations from policies and procedures set forth in the this
chapter will be processed as variances, and proposed deviations from the
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual (including Appendix D of those Standards)
will require review and approval from the Hancock County Drainage Board and/or
Hancock County Surveyor.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.701 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in the local zoning ordinances is also necessary.
Compliance with all applicable ordinances of Hancock County as well as with
applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations shall also be required.
Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter
shall be the most recent edition available. Violations of the requirements of
this chapter are subject to the penalties listed below.
   (A)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or approval/permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater
maintenance agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in
this subchapter. Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance
and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of
any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
   (B)   Warning notice. When Hancock County finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, Hancock County may serve upon that person a written warning
notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and
requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a
resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or
resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves
the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this division shall limit the
authority of Hancock County to take any action, including emergency action or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 2005-12C, passed 12-12-05; Am. Ord. 2018-11-A, passed 12-5-18; Am. Ord.
2022-10A, passed 10-4-22)
§ 154.702 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   If Hancock County determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit/approval,
an approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit/approval therefore, the
notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in
charge of the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, Hancock County may impose alternative
compensatory actions upon a violator, such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, and the like.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person found in violation of any provision of this chapter
shall be responsible for a civil infraction and subject to the minimum fines as
specified in the latest version of penalty matrix approved by the Hancock
County Drainage Board, plus costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such
violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate offense and shall make
the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for each day. The rights and
remedies provided for in this section are cumulative and in addition to any
other remedies provided by law. An admission or determination of responsibility
shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, "subsequent offense" means a
violation of the provisions of this chapter committed by the same person within
12 months of a previous violation of the same provision of this chapter for
which said person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be responsible.
      (4)   The following schedule of fines have been established by the county
for violations associated with the compliance with sediment and erosion control
measures.

   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, Hancock County may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by Hancock County to proceed with the work. A stop work order will
be posted on the site by Hancock County and it is unlawful for any person to
remove the notice or continue any work on the site without permission from
Hancock County. Hancock County may also undertake or cause to be undertaken,
any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this
chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost
of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person
carrying out or participating in the work.
      (2)   Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work order
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
less than $1,000, and such person shall also pay such costs as may be imposed
in the discretion of the court. A permit approval reinstatement fee may also be
assessed by Hancock County.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. If applicable, Hancock County may
refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other
improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant
or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the
notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, of modification of approvals/permits. Hancock
County may suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit/approval that the
violator may also have been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or
modified permit/approval may be reinstated after the applicant or other
responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of
violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided
such permit/approval may be reinstated upon such conditions as Hancock County
may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take
the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When Hancock County finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that
the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, Hancock County may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance
requirements and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, Hancock County may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage system
or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
         (c)   Hancock County may allow the person to recommence its discharge
when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of Hancock County that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initialed against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to Hancock County within five days of receipt of the emergency
order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
Hancock County may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, Hancock County
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to
persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. Hancock County will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access.
The violator may petition Hancock County for a reconsideration and hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
approval of Hancock County.
   (H)   Criminal penalties for violations. For intentional and flagrant
violations of this chapter, Hancock County may issue a notice to the applicant
or other responsible person and the owner of the property, requiring such
person to appear in the Circuit or Superior Court of the county to answer
charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a
fine as set by the Hancock County Drainage Board, plus costs, damages, and
expenses or imprisonment for 60 days or both. Each act of violation and each
day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

2022-10A, passed 10-4-22)
§ 154.703 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, Hancock County may, after giving notice
and opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner
shall be required to promptly reimburse Hancock County for all costs of such
work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent Hancock County from taking such
other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage
system made necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by
the EPA or IDEM for violation of Hancock County's NPDES permit, administrative
costs, attorney fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with
the enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of Hancock County or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.

2022-10A, passed 10-4-22)
§ 154.704 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Hancock County Board
of Commissioners the action or decision whereby any such provision was so
applied. Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis
for the appeal. The Hancock County Board of Commissioners shall consider the
appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the action
being appealed. In considering any such appeal, the Hancock County Board of
Commissioners may consider the recommendations of the Hancock County Staff and
the comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering
any such appeal, the Hancock County Board of Commissioners may grant a variance
from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the
action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements
are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the provisions of this chapter being appealed
will present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development
site; provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need
for the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply
with this chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of Hancock
County upholding the decision of Hancock County, then representatives of
Hancock County shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized
to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in
possession of any premises to refuse to allow Hancock County or its designated
contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

methods as determined acceptable by the Commission and the County Health
Department.
   SKETCH PLAN. A sketch plan of a proposed subdivision used to show the Plan
Commission the location, proposed street and lot layout, and many other
significant features of the proposed subdivision.
   STREET. The space or area between the lot lines, abutting upon a right-of-
way and designed as a way for vehicular traffic whether designated as an alley,
street, highway, throughway, freeway, expressway, road, avenue, boulevard,
lane, place, or however otherwise designated, and which shall include but not
be limited to those illustrated in the County Comprehensive Plan. For the
purpose of this chapter STREET shall be classified as follows:
      (1)   ALLEY. A minor way which is used primarily for vehicular service
access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
      (2)   ARTERIALS. Those Federal and State roads of regional importance.
These are high capacity highways moving traffic at fast rates of speed. They
provide good continuity between distant points and are constructed to high
standards. ARTERIALS provide two to four traffic lanes and should have a median
strip wherever possible. Crossing traffic from other roads and access to
abutting properties are often controlled, or partially so.
      (3)   CUL-DE-SAC STREET. A local road with only one outlet, having a
paved, circular turnaround area at the closed end.
      (4)   FREEWAYS. Limited-access highways which carry large volumes of
interstate traffic and have more importance regionally than locally. They often
contain four or more moving lanes and permit a continuous high speed traffic
flow. These highways have a high order of design and construction requirements.
      (5)   LOCAL ROADS. Low capacity and low speed roads whose function is to
provide direct access to homes and property. Through traffic and heavy use of
these roads should be discouraged. To the extent possible, residence driveways
and ingress and egress points to other uses or structures should be oriented to
the LOCAL ROADS rather than to the arterials or collectors.
      (6)   LOCAL SUBDIVISION STREETS. Low capacity and low speed streets
within major subdivisions whose function is to provide direct access to homes
and property. Through traffic and heavy use of these streets should be
discouraged.
      (7)   MAJOR COLLECTOR HIGHWAYS. Highways having less regional importance
than the Arterial Highways and more county or inter-county significance. They
are medium capacity highways moving traffic at relatively fast rates of speed.
They include both state designated routes and county roads. MAJOR COLLECTOR
HIGHWAYS provide two traffic lanes.
      (8)   MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS. Local roads which are parallel to and
adjacent to arterial streets and highways, and which provide access to abutting
properties and protection from through traffic.
      (9)   MINOR COLLECTOR ROADS. Moderate capacity thoroughfares designed to
accommodate relatively low speed traffic. They should, however, provide a
smooth flow of traffic. Two moving lanes, unseparated, but wider than local
road lanes are required.
   SUBDIVIDER. The registered owner or the authorized agent of the registered
owner of a subdivision being responsible for preparing and recording the plat
of the subdivision and for carrying out all appropriate requirements outlined
in these regulations for the subdividing of land.
   SUBDIVISION.
      (1)   The division of a parcel of land into two or more lots, parcels,
sites, units, plats or interests for the purpose of offer, sale, lease or
development, either on the installment plan or upon any and all other plans,
terms, and conditions, including re-subdivision. SUBDIVISION includes the
division of land zoned for residential and nonresidential uses, whether by
deed, metes and bounds description, devise, intestacy, lease, map, plat, or
other recorded instrument. The following kinds of division of existing parcels
of land are herein called exempt divisions. These divisions are exempt from the
platting provisions of this chapter. Exempt division must be one of the
following types of division:
         (a)   A division of land into two or more tracts, all of which are at
least ten acres in size;
         (b)   A division of land for the sale or exchange of tracts to correct
errors in an existing legal description, provided that no additional building
sites other than for accessory buildings are created by the division;
         (c)   A division of land pursuant to an allocation of land in the
settlement of a decedent’s estate or a court decree for the distribution of
property;
         (d)   A division of land for the acquisition of street right-of-way,
or easement;
         (e)   A division of land for the sale or exchange of additional tracts
between adjoining land owners, provided that no additional building sites other
than for accessory buildings are created by the division; and/or
         (f)   A division of land into cemetery plats for the purpose of burial
of corpses.
      (2)   MAJOR SUBDIVISION. Any subdivision not classified as a minor
subdivision, including but not limited to subdivisions of four or more lots, or
any size subdivision requiring any new street or extension of local
governmental facilities or the creation of any public improvements.
      (3)   MINOR SUBDIVISION. The division of a single lot, tract or parcel of
land, or part thereof, into not more than three lots, tracts or parcels of
land, including the remainder of the original tract, any one of which is less
than ten acres, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of
ownership, or construction of residential, commercial or industrial purposes.
However, this definition shall not include division of land for agricultural
purposes only. A MINOR SUBDIVISION shall not involve any new street or
extension of local governmental facilities, or the creation of any public
improvements.
   TECHNICAL COMMITTEE. A Plan Commission subcommittee, including persons with
technical knowledge of various county, state, and federal regulations and
standards regarding development, appointed by the Plan Commission to form a
Committee responsible for working with developers in reviewing the technical
aspects of subdivision plans and other major development projects and making
technical findings for the Plan Commission for their consideration in approving
subdivision and development plans. The Committee shall be composed of the
following individuals, or their representative:
      (1)   The Sanitarian of the County Health Department;

shall make written findings that set forth its reasons and a decision denying
primary approval. The Commission may also refer a plat back to the Technical
Committee for review or study on a specific technical matter.
   (E)   Approval of a primary plat shall not constitute approval of a
secondary plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the
layout submitted on the primary plat as a guide to the preparation of the
secondary plat and shall permit the subdivider to proceed with construction or
permanent improvements for which designs and specifications shall have been
approved by the appropriate agencies. Approval of the primary plat will
terminate two years after the date of approval unless further extended by the
Commission upon written request of the subdivider, and by filing 60 days prior
to the expiration of the approval and by payment of a filing fee established by
the County Plan Commission.
   (F)   Subsequent approval will be required of the engineering proposals

each copy that it has been approved. One copy shall be returned to the
subdivider along with a written statement indicating the action taken by the
Commission. If approved with conditions, a written copy of the conditions shall
accompany each copy of the approved plat. If disapproved, the Commission shall
return to the subdivider three copies of the primary plat marked “Disapproved
by the Hancock County Plan Commission,” along with a written statement
indicating the reason or reasons for its disapproval.
   (H)   All subdivisions, business, or industrial use must comply with
Chapter 154 Stormwater Drainage, Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations.

§ 155.056 REVIEW PROCEDURE OF TECHNICAL COMMITTEE.
      (A)   Upon receipt of an application for secondary plat approval, the
Technical Committee shall review the secondary plat and make a report to the
Plan Commission Executive Director within 15 days after the final filing date.
      (1)   If the Technical Committee finds that the secondary plat has been
prepared in accordance with the terms of this chapter, they shall forward a
report so stating to the Plan Commission Executive Director for consideration.
      (2)   If the Technical Committee finds that the secondary plat has not
been prepared in accordance with the terms of this chapter, they shall return
the plat to the subdivider with a written specification of the items of
nonconformance and shall submit a copy of the same to the Plan Commission
Executive Director.
   (B)   The Plan Commission Executive Director shall, upon the filing of an
application for secondary plat approval, review the secondary plat along with
the accompanying data, review the report of the Technical Committee, and
determine whether or not the secondary plat meets all minimum requirements and
standards of this chapter and of all other applicable ordinances in the county.
The Plan Commission Executive Director shall then take one of the following
actions on the secondary plat within 30 days after its submission or a mutually
agreed upon extension.
      (1)   (a)   If the Plan Commission Executive Director determines that
upon the satisfactory completion of one or more specified conditions consistent
with the requirements, standards, and specifications of this chapter, the
secondary plat would comply with the terms of this chapter, the Plan Commission
Executive Director may give conditional approval to the plat.
         (b)   Conditional approval of a secondary plat may include a
construction agreement which is acceptable to the Plan Commission Executive
Director and would permit the subdivider to proceed with the installation of
improvements prior to recording. Written notice of the conditional approval
shall constitute formal authorization to the subdivider to construct and
install all or a part of the required improvements, subject to inspection and
acceptance procedures required by this chapter. The subdivider shall furnish
sufficient evidence to the Plan Commission Executive Director of the
satisfactory completion of the conditions before the plat will be deemed "final
approval for record."
      (2)   The Plan Commission Executive Director shall approve the secondary
plat for recording only after it has determined that the secondary plat meets
the minimum requirements of this chapter and all applicable ordinances in the
county and that sufficient financial guarantees have been submitted in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   Should the Plan Commission Executive Director decide to disapprove
the plat, written notice of the action, together with reasons therefor, shall
be transmitted to the subdivider. The action shall also be entered on the
official records of the Commission, provided, however, that nothing contained
therein shall prejudice the subdivider's ability to make reapplication for
secondary plat approval according to the terms of this chapter.
      (4)   Should the Plan Commission Executive Director have a question
regarding a specific technical aspect of the plat which had not previously been
studied by the Technical Committee, the Plan Commission Executive Director may
refer the plat along with a detailed statement of the question to the Technical
Committee for a finding.
      (5)   After review of the secondary plat, drainage calculations and
construction plans must be reviewed in accordance to
Chapter 154 before construction may begin. All plans must be stamped approved
by the County Surveyor and Highway Engineer.
   (C)   Upon final approval of the secondary plat, the Plan Commission
Executive Director shall indicate upon each copy that it has been approved. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider, along with the written statement
indicating the action taken by the Plan Commission Executive Director. If
approved with conditions, a written copy of the conditions shall accompany each
copy of the approved secondary plat.
   (D)   Final approval of a plat by the Plan Commission Executive Director
shall not be construed as an acceptance by the public of the offer of
dedication of any street improvement, way, place, structure, utility
improvements, or open space improvement within the areas shown upon the plat
unless the acceptance is endorsed by the County Board of Commissioners upon the
original tracing of the secondary plat.
   (E)   After the Plan Commission Executive Director has granted final
approval of the plat for recording, the officers shall affix their signatures
to the original tracing and the subdivider shall record the plat with the
County Recorder within 18 months. If not recorded within this time, the
approval shall be null and void, unless further extended by the Plan Commission
Executive Director upon written request of the subdivider, filed with the Plan
Commission Executive Director 60 days prior to the expiration of the approval
and by payment of a filing fee established by the Executive Director of the
County Plan Commission. The subdivider shall pay the recording fee, and file
with the Commission four prints of the approved secondary plat, including
restrictive covenants, as recorded. One reproducible print of the secondary
plat, as recorded, shall be filed and retained in the office of the County
Surveyor. Until the prints have been so filed, no improvement location permit,
occupancy permit, or other permits shall be issued for any lot shown upon the
plat.

   (A)   Only one street, driveway or point of vehicle access shall be
permitted from a subdivision onto a major collector highway, arterial highway,
or minor collector road. Two or more streets, driveways, or point of vehicle
access may be permitted by the Commission if one or more of the following
reasons
are met: To preserve, promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience and general welfare of the county and traffic circulation in the
area.
   (B)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other requirements
of these regulations, and where the Commission or the County Board of
Commissioners finds it will be proper to require the dedication of the other
half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
planned within the tract.
   (C)   No street names may be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. All street names shall include a directional
element to position the street appropriately within the north-south and east-
west grid covering the county. The streets which are logical extensions or
continuations of, or obviously in alignment with any existing streets, either
constructed or appearing on any validly recorded plat, shall bear the names of
the existing streets.
   (D)   Rights-of-way for proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the proposed subdivision so that a connection can be made to all
adjacent properties unless the extension is not feasible because of topography
or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion the Commission, the
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination with existing
streets or the most advantageous development of adjacent tracts. In any event,
no subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate the land-locking
of adjacent undeveloped land.
   (E)   A temporarily dead-ended street shall be permitted in any case in
which a street is proposed to be and should logically be extended but is not
yet constructed. An adequate easement for a turnaround shall be provided for
any temporary dead-end street which extends 200 feet or more in length. The
easement shall be automatically vacated to abutting property owners when the
dead-ended street is legally extended.
   (F)   In subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not
conform to the minimum right- of-way dimensions as established by this chapter,
the subdivider shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides
of the streets of inadequate width so as to bring them up to standards,
provided the area to be used for widening is owned by the subdivider or under
his or her control.
   (G)   The following provisions shall be required as a provision of the
restrictive covenants of all secondary plats to which they apply.
      (1)   No fence, wall, hedge, tree or shrub planting which obstructs sight
lines and elevations between two and one-half and eight feet above the street
shall be placed or permitted to remain on any corner lot within the triangular
area formed by the street right-of-way lines and a line connecting points 40
feet from the intersection of the minor street lines, and 75 feet from the
intersection of arterial streets, or in the case of a rounded property corner,
from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines extended.
      (2)   The same sight line limitations shall apply to any lot within ten
feet of the intersection of a street right-of-way line with the edge of the
driveway pavement or alley line. No driveway shall be located within 70 feet of
the intersection of two street lines. No drainage structures shall be located
within driveway limits.
      (3)   No sump pump drains or other drains shall outlet onto the street.
      (4)   No trees shall be planted in the county right-of-way.
      (5)   No vehicle shall be parked on the public street for more than 24
hours.
      (6)   Snow removal for the subdivision internal streets shall be the
responsibility of the developer or homeowner’s association.
      (7)   The maintenance of all irrigation or sprinkler systems installed in
the right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the individual homeowner or
developer. Hancock County assumes no responsibility for maintenance or damage
of any kind.
      (8)   Each homeowner (lot owner) shall be responsible for constructing a
four-foot wide concrete sidewalk of 4,000 psi concrete, four inches thick,
sloped toward the street with expansion joints each 48 feet along the entire
street frontage of their respective lot. The sidewalk shall be constructed
prior to completing finish lot grading. The sidewalk shall be located one foot
inside the street right-of-way line, (not on the lot) and parallel to the
street right-of-way line. The lot owner is responsible for the repair and
maintenance of the sidewalk for the initial one year from completion of
residence. Thereafter, the homeowner’s association shall be responsible for
maintenance and upkeep of the sidewalk except for any damage done by the
adjoining lot owner. All public sidewalks shall comply with all Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended, requirements and in the situation of a
conflict between ADA rules, covenants or other regulations, the ADA shall
govern.
      (9)   Unless provided by the local municipality, the homeowner’s
association shall negotiate with and procure trash pick-up and curbside
recycling services from one provider for all of the owners in the subdivision.

§ 155.073 BLOCK STANDARDS.
   (A)   Block length and width or acreage within bounding streets shall be
designed to accommodate the size of the lot required in the area by this
chapter and to provide for convenient access, circulation control, and safety
of street traffic. Blocks that are unreasonably large or small will not be
approved.
   (B)   The maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet. In the design of blocks
longer than 800 feet, the Commission may specify the provision of pedestrian
crosswalks near the center, or wherever most useful to facilitate pedestrians’
circulation to a school, park, recreation area, shopping center, or other
significant neighborhood destination.
   (C)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where reverse frontage lots bordering a
freeway, arterial street or flood plain are used.
   (D)   No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is made, but blocks
must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their design must
evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow, and public areas.
(’86 Code, § 7.1-40) (Ord. 1993-9G, passed 9-27-93)

individual septic systems, perimeter drains installed as a part of the septic
system may be located in common easements designated for drainage and
utilities.
   (E)   The following shall be lettered on each proposed plat depicting a
secondary septic field easement:
      The secondary septic field easement shown on this plat shall be deemed a
permanent easement and permanently reserved for the construction of a secondary
septic field in the event that the primary septic field fails. The easement
area shall remain undisturbed, with no buildings, structures or any other thing
located within the easement. The easement should also remain free of any
process or thing that might cause compaction of the soils.

§ 155.076 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   It is recognized that the subdivider, in creating commercial and
industrial subdivisions, faces unique problems of lot design not normally
encountered in residential subdivisions. For this reason, the initial emphasis
of the Commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement. Generally,
the procedural requirements shall be for the owner to follow the regular
procedure outlined in these regulations. However, the subdivider need show only
two lots along with the street and block layout. Then from time to time, as
prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required
specifications, the owner shall submit an amendment to the approved recorded
subdivision plat for consideration.
   (B)   Regular procedural requirements of the Commission following the
receipt of a final subdivision plat shall then apply, except those streets that
have been built by following an approved set of plans on the previously
approved secondary plat shall not have to be rebuilt because of the adoption of
new criteria by the county. This shall also apply to storm drainage facilities
within the subdivision unless runoff characteristics have been changed by the
newly proposed improvements or unauthorized existing improvements.
   (C)   Drainage must meet all the requirements under
Chapter 154 Stormwater Drainage, Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations.
(’86 Code, § 7.1-43) (Ord. 1993-9G, passed 9-27-93; Am. Ord. 2015-10E, passed

         (b)   For collector streets, an eight-inch reinforced concrete
pavement, on six inches of compacted #53 stone on modified subgrade per Section
215 of the Standard Specifications, shall be used.
      (3)   The provisions for construction of rigid (plain concrete) pavement
construction shall be as follows:
         (a)   At the time of placement of the concrete, the subgrade shall be
properly dampened just prior to the placement where it has become dry, where
the surface has been removed by final grading, or for any other reason it has
not been properly dampened. Concrete pavement shall be in accordance with
Section 500 of the Standard Specifications or any subsequent amendments
thereto. Concrete shall be finished by machine or vibratory screed except on
widened portions, intersections or other places where hand-finishing will be
permitted. Weakened plane or dummy, transverse, or contraction joints shall be
placed not to exceed 20-foot spacing. Closer spacing to average 15 feet will be
encouraged. Transverse contraction joints may be of formed or sawed dummy
groove, ribbon or premolded strip type, and shall be one-fourth the pavement
depth. When transverse joints are to be formed by sawing, care must be taken to
prevent the formation of cracks due to contraction of the slab. All transverse
joints shall be sawed within eight hours after the placing of the concrete.
Expansion joints, with -inch preformed joint filler, shall be placed at every
catch basin and manhole in line of the pavement. The location of manholes and
the like in the pavement shall determine the exact location of the joints. All
joints shall extend through curbs to the full width of the pavement;
         (b)   Whenever the width between forms of the pavement under
construction is greater than 13 feet, longitudinal joints shall be constructed
so as to divide the pavement into strips not to exceed 13 feet each. This shall
be accomplished by a deformed key plate installed prior to the depositing of
the concrete;
         (c)   The method of curing shall be a white pigmented curing compound
type 2, complying with AASHTO M 148, and shall be applied in one or two
applications as directed by the County Engineer. When applied in two

§ 155.092 DRAINAGE AND SANITARY SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   In order to insure the maintenance of a properly designed and installed
drainage system, the following divisions shall be required as a provision of
the restrictive covenants of all secondary plats and shall be included in all
deeds written relative to the plats. The proposed owner shall sign and the
signed copy of this covenant shall be filed with the County Surveyor.
   (A)   Drainage swales, or ditches, along dedicated roadways and within the
right-of-way, or on dedicated drainage easements, are not to be altered, dug
out, filled in, tiled, or otherwise changed without the written permission of
the County Highway Engineer. Property owners must maintain these swales as
sodded grassways or other non-eroding surfaces. Water from roofs or parking
areas must be contained on the property long enough so that the drainage swales
or ditches will not be damaged by the water. Driveways may be constructed over
these swales or ditches only when appropriate sized culverts are installed as
set out in §
155.091(E).
   (B)   Any property owner altering, changing, or damaging these drainage
swales or ditches will be held responsible for the action and will be given ten
days notice by registered mail to repair the damage, after which time, if no
action is taken, the County Highway Engineer will cause the repairs to be

minimum requirements for the protection of the health, safety, comfort,
convenience, and general welfare of the people at large, and are designed to

reconstructed, moved, altered, converted, or enlarged; nor shall any structure
or land be used or existing use be expanded, except in full compliance with all

§ 156.004 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Official zoning map. The zoning map for Hancock County in effect on
the date of adoption of this chapter, officially labeled "Official Hancock
County, Indiana Zoning Map", is hereby included as part of this chapter. The
map may also be known and referred to as the official zoning map and as the
zoning map. The official zoning map shall include the ordinance number by which
it was adopted and the date of adoption.
   (B)   Official zoning map copies. Copies of the official zoning map may be
made and distributed to interested persons. The official zoning map copies
shall be labeled as copies and have the date which they were last modified
printed on them. A fee may be established for the purchase of official zoning
map copies.
   (C)   Location of the official zoning map. The official zoning map will be
located in the office of the Hancock County Area Plan Commission.
   (D)   Zoning district boundaries and identification. The zoning district
boundaries shall be as shown on the official zoning map. The abbreviations for
the zoning districts appearing in this chapter shall be used to identify the
zoning districts on the official zoning map. Planned unit developments shall be
indicated on the official zoning map using the three-digit "PUD" abbreviation
and the ordinance number by which each PUD is created. Rezonings that include
conditions, commitments or restrictions shall be noted as such.
   (E)   Regular revisions. The official zoning map should be formally revised
annually, or otherwise as the Plan Commission determines necessary.
      (1)   Zoning map amendments. A notation on the official zoning map shall
be made within two business days of the effective date of any approved
ordinance making a zoning map amendment. The notation shall be made either
electronically or through a permanent-pen hand-written note. The notation shall
include the ordinance number by which the change was approved and the date of
the approval by the appropriate legislative body.
      (2)   Errors and omissions. Other revisions may be made to correct
drafting or other errors or omissions in the zoning map, but shall not have the
effect of amending the map.
   (F)   Damaged, destroyed, or lost official zoning map. In the event that the
official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret,
the Board of County Commissioners may, by ordinance, adopt a new official
zoning map which shall, to the extent possible, duplicate the accuracy of the
damaged, destroyed or lost or completely destroyed, it or any significant parts
shall be preserved, together with any available records of its adoption and
amendment.
   (G)   Interpretation standards. Zoning district boundaries on the official
zoning map shall be interpreted as follows:
      (1)   Streets and easements. Zoning district boundaries shown within the
lines of roads, easements, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to
follow the center lines.
      (2)   Property lines. Zoning district boundaries indicated as following
section or fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines, or municipal
corporation lines shall be construed as following such lines.
      (3)   Bodies of water. Zoning district boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow such center lines. Boundaries indicated as
following shore lines shall be construed as moving with any change in the
actual shore line.
      (4)   Divided lots. When a zoning district boundary line divides a lot or
parcel, the Planning Director shall determine the applicable zoning district.
The Planning Director may require a rezone or replat of the site if any portion
of a construction or development proposal overlaps two or more zoning
districts. The petitioner shall be responsible for filing the appropriate forms
and for paying the appropriate filing fees to rezone or replat the lot or
parcel. If a portion of a lot or parcel is in an overlay district, the the
entire lot or parcel shall be deemed as being within the overlay district.
      (5)   Extensions of lines. Zoning district boundaries indicated as
parallel to or extensions of the features listed in divisions (G)(1) through
(4) above shall be construed as so.
   (H)   Interpretation procedure. The Planning Director shall determine the
applicable zoning for each property in the Plan Commission's jurisdiction as
described in divisions (G)(1) through (5) above.
      (1)   Appeals of Planning Director interpretations. Any ruling of the
Planning Director pertaining to the district boundaries may be appealed to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Plan Commission interpretation required. If the Planning Director
cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary, immediate
action on any affected application shall be delayed until such time when the
Plan Commission determines the zoning district boundary and the Plan Commission
shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the
scale of the official zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant
provisions of this chapter. This interpretation may occur as part of a regular
or special Plan Commission meeting and does not require a public hearing.
Decisions of the Plan Commission may not be appealed to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, but may be appealed to a court of jurisdiction.
   (I)   Effect of vacation on zoning. Whenever any street, alley, public way,
railroad right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by the proper
authority, the zoning districts adjoining each side of vacated areas shall be
extended automatically to the center of the vacated area. All areas included in
the vacation shall then be subject to all regulations of the extended zoning
districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining zoning district,
or zoning district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically
to include all of the vacated area.

ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 156.020 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Establishment of zoning districts.  For the purpose of this chapter,
the planning jurisdiction is divided into the following zoning districts. Each
of the zoning districts stands alone and is not part of a hierarchy-system of
zoning. For example, uses permitted in the CN district are not permitted in the
CC district unless expressly listed as such in the CC district. Only those uses
and standards that are expressly indicated and noted for each district apply to
that district. These districts, including PUDs, are graphically represented on
the official zoning map, which is hereby declared to be a part of this
subchapter.
      (1)   Agricultural Zoning District
         A - Agricultural
      (2)   Residential Zoning Districts
         RR - Residential: Rural
         R1.0 - Residential: 1.0
         R2.5 - Residential: 2.5
         R3.5 - Residential: 3.5
         R5.0 - Residential: 5.0
         RMH - Residential: Manufactured Home Park
         RM - Residential: Multifamily
      (3)   Commercial Zoning Districts
         CN - Commercial: Neighborhood
         CC - Commercial: Community
         CR - Commercial: Regional
      (4)   Institutional Zoning District
         IN - Institutional
      (5)   Industrial Zoning Districts
         IBP - Industrial: Business Park
         IL - Industrial: Light
         IG - Industrial: General
   (B)   Establishment of Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. This chapter
allows for any zoning district(s) to be rezoned for the creation of a PUD. All
PUDs shall be consistent with the requirements of §§
156.050
 et seq.
   (C)   Subdivision of land. The subdivision of land in every zoning district
shall be consistent with the provisions of the applicable subdivision control
ordinance for the jurisdiction in which the property is located.

   Development standards, see §§
156.060 et seq.

156.040 et seq.
   Planned unit developments, see §§
 
156.050 et seq.
§ 156.021 LAND USES.
   (A)   Land uses specified. Each land use is either a permitted, non-
permitted or a special exception use in each zoning district. A general list of
permitted and special exception uses for each district are noted in the
Permitted Uses and Special Exceptions divisions accompanying the description of
each district in this subchapter. The graphics that accompany the descriptions
of each land use are to be considered representative and not to scale. Specific
land uses are also listed in the Land Use Matrix following division (B) below.
As noted in the Land Use Matrix, certain large-scale solar energy system
projects additionally require Overlay District approval in order to be a
permitted use. The designation of special exception is not meant to imply that
the use in question will be disallowed, only that they will be reviewed and
checked for conformance with county standards and will require a public
hearing.
   (B)   Unlisted or questionable land uses. Any use not listed as a permitted
use or special exception use is considered non-permitted. The Planning Director
may determine into which category any use is placed if it is not specifically
listed but is similar to another use that is a permitted or a special exception
use. This determination may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals
consistent with the provisions of §
156.104.

and yard requirements as specified for the A District.
   (B)   General lot requirements.  All lots shall comply with the following
requirements consistent with the applicable lot standards:
      (1)   Legal nonconforming lots. All lots legally established prior to the
effective date of this chapter which are in conflict with the lot standards
shall be considered legal non-conforming lots consistent with the provisions of
§§
156.090 et seq.
      (2)   Compliance requirements. Except as provided in this chapter, no
structure shall be erected, altered, enlarged or reconstructed unless such
alteration, enlargement, or reconstruction conforms with the lot regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located. The lot requirements of this
subchapter shall not apply in instances where this chapter specifically
provides alternate requirements, such as an overlay zoning district.
      (3)   Setback standards.  No portion of any structure is allowed to be
located within the required setbacks. Structures shall include, but not be
limited to garages, carports, balconies, roofs, decks, chimneys, fire escapes,
and platforms above adjacent grade level. Parking spaces, interior drives,
other vehicle use areas and sidewalks shall be permitted within the required
setbacks at adjacent grade level subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Violation of these standards will subject the property owner to the penalties
described under §§
156.115 et seq.
   (C)   Development standards. All structures and land uses, including any
alterations to either, that are established or otherwise occur after the
effective date of this chapter shall conform to the development standards
provided by this chapter. The development standards that apply to each zoning
district shall be as cross-referenced in the description of each district in
this subchapter and as described in the development standards set forth in §§
156.060 et seq. The development standards shall not apply in instances where
this chapter specifically provides alternate requirements, such as an overlay
zoning district or performance-based standards.
   (D)   Dwellings. In any district, no residential primary or accessory
structure may be located closer than 750 feet to a waste control structure for
a confined feeding operation as required and defined by I.C. 13-18-10. This
provision shall apply only to structures that would require a building permit
pursuant to this chapter. This provision may be waived or modified subject to
the granting of a special exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (E)   Confined feeding. No confined feeding operation, as defined in I.C.
13-18-10, or waste control structure for a confined feeding operation may be
located closer than 100 feet to a street right-of-way line, 750 feet to an
existing residential zoning district boundary line, or 750 feet to an existing
residential primary or accessory structure other than that of the applicant.
This provision shall apply only to those structures that would require a
building permit pursuant to this chapter. This provision may be waived or
modified subject to the granting of a special exception by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (F)   Dwellings - concentrated animal feeding operations. In any district,
no residential primary or accessory structure may be located closer than 750
feet to the property boundary line of a waste control structure for a
concentrated animal feeding operation, as required and defined by 40 CFR
122.23. This provision shall apply only to structures that would require a
building permit pursuant to this chapter. This provision may be waived or
modified subject to the granting of a special exception by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (G)   Concentrated animal feeding operation. No concentrated animal feeding
operation or waste control structure for a concentrated animal feeding
operation, as defined by 40 CFR 122.23, may be located closer than 750 feet to
an existing residential zoning district boundary line or 750 feet to the
property boundary line of the applicant. This provision shall apply only to
those structures that would require a building permit pursuant to this chapter.
This provision may be waived or modified subject to the granting of a special
exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (H)   (1)   Exception. Notwithstanding §
156.022(G), a concentrated animal feeding operation as defined by 40 CFR
122.23, or waste control structure for a concentrated animal feeding operation,
may be located no closer than 350 feet to an existing residential zoning
district boundary line or 350 feet to the property boundary line of the
applicant, provided that the operation complies with the following buffering
standards.
      (2)   General buffering standards. A buffer yard of shrubs and evergreen
trees shall be located a maximum of 100 feet (as measured from the base of the
mound) from the concentrated animal feeding structures or waste control
structures, and surround the entire feeding operation. Adequate ingress and
egress through the buffer yard shall be approved by the Planning Director. All
required shrubs shall be minimum 24 inches tall, as measured from grade at time
of planting. The final minimum height of the buffer shall not be less than
eight feet in height at any point where the buffer is required. The shrubs and
trees shall be supplemented by an undulating mound, a minimum of three feet in
height, with a maximum slope of 3:1 (rise:run).
         (a)   Responsibility. The owner of the property being developed or
otherwise changed in use is responsible for installing the buffer yard at the
time of that development or change. The adjacent property owner shall not have
to participate in installing the buffer yard.
         (b)   Planting location. Required buffer yard shrubs and trees may be
placed either at regular intervals or in irregular patterns representing a
natural landscape. No buffer yard or required landscape materials shall be
placed within any easement, right-of-way or septic field.
         (c)   Tree size. Evergreen conifers must be a minimum of two feet in
height, measured from the top of the root ball when planted. The separation
between trees shall not exceed eight feet on center.
         (d)   Ground cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with
trees, shrubs or other landscaped materials shall be covered with grass or
other ground-covering vegetation. Landscaping stone or other non-vegetative
surfaces may not be substituted for ground-covering vegetation unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Director.
         (e)   Maintenance. All landscape materials must be properly maintained
and kept in a neat and orderly appearance, free from all debris and refuse.
            1.   All plant material that, in the opinion of the Planning
Director, is unhealthy or dead shall be replaced by the end of the next spring
or fall planting season.
            2.   Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature
over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures
may only be used to ensure the public safety.
         (f)   Qualifying trees and shrubs.  Refer to the evergreen tree and
shrub species tables in §
156.075 for the list of qualifying trees and shrubs.
   (I)   Residential facility for the developmentally disabled type I. A
residential facility which provides residential services for not more than
eight developmentally disabled individuals, as defined by I.C. 12-28-4-8 and
established under a program authorized under I.C. 12-11-1.1(e)(1) or I.C.
12.11-1.1(e)(2), shall meet the same zoning requirements, development standards
and building codes as other residential structures or improvements in the same
residential zoning district or classification.

§ 156.041 WELLFIELD PROTECTION (WP-OL).
   (A)   Intent. This section is intended to safeguard the public health,
safety, and general welfare of those persons within Hancock County who rely on
public and/or utility-operated wellfields for clean, safe drinking water. These
regulations are intended to prevent land uses and certain development practices
that commonly have the potential to degrade water quality by introducing
chemicals, organic hazards, and other potentially harmful elements into the
ground water system within the five-year capture area of the wellfields. This
includes the introduction of hazardous materials into the area, the creation of
hazardous by-products from onsite activities, and the alteration of the land in
a manner that increases the exposure of the ground water system to potential
contaminants.
   (B)   Boundaries and exemptions. The Wellfield Protection Overlay District
(WP-OL) shall apply to all properties as indicated on the official zoning map
of Hancock County, but shall generally conform to the boundaries of the five-
year wellfield capture areas within the county's jurisdiction (as updated
periodically).
   (C)   Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying district(s) are permitted
in the Wellfield Protection Overlay District; and all uses that are special
exceptions in the underlying district(s) are special exceptions in the
Wellfield Protection Overlay District unless specifically noted otherwise
below.
      (1)   Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited in the
Wellfield Protection Overlay District (see the land use matrix set forth in §
156.021 for detailed use listings):

storage facility (outdoor); concrete/asphalt production facility; contractor's
warehouse/storage facility; food and beverage production; general industrial
production; hazardous materials production; light industrial assembly and
distribution; light industrial processing and distribution; mineral extraction
and processing; research and development facility; truck freight terminal;
truck sales and service center; and waste disposal facility.
      (2)   Uses not specified. The Plan Commission, through the site
development plan review process, may also prohibit or impose conditions on
other uses not listed in division (C)(1) above that are reasonably demonstrated
to pose a hazard to the drinking water supply due to chemicals used onsite or
by-products of onsite activities. Some examples of this type of use may include
building cleaning or maintenance service companies, engineering or vocational
shops or laboratories, landscape or lawn installation or maintenance services,
and mortuaries.
   (D)   Development standards. All development within the boundaries of the
Wellfield Protection Overlay District shall comply with all applicable state,

         (a)   No surface impoundments, ponds, or lagoons shall be established
except for the purpose of:
            1.   Storm water retention and detention ponds, or
            2.   Recreation and landscaping purposes.
         (b)   All detention and retention ponds shall be constructed in a
manner that provides an effective barrier to the migration of potential
contaminants into the ground water and in accordance with the Stormwater
Drainage Ordinances of Hancock County or McCordsville.
      (3)   Public sewer service. All development, with the exception of a
single-family residence located on a lot of at least two acres, shall be
connected to a public sewer. All floor drains must be routed to a temporary
holding area for future removal or as otherwise permitted by the Planning
Director.
      (4)   Trash and recycling containers. All non-residential trash and
recycling containers shall be located on hard-surfaced areas that drain to a
public storm sewer.
      (5)   Storage and transfer of potential contaminants.  All areas that may
be used for the storage and/or transfer of potential ground water contaminants
shall be constructed in a manner to prevent any release from the area from
reaching the ground water. The containment area shall be capable of, at a
minimum, containing 110% of the potentially hazardous material for which the
area has storage and transfer capacity.
      (6)   Auto repair facilities. All vehicle and auto repair facilities
shall be located within an enclosed building that includes a floor constructed
of material that forms an effective barrier to prevent the migration of fluids
or other materials into the ground water.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.042 CORRIDOR (C-OL).
   (A)   Intent. 
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish an overlay district to
address the unique characteristics of the properties adjacent to Hancock
County's transportation routes. These corridors have unique traffic management
needs, development pressures, and aesthetic characteristics that require the
establishment of additional development standards to meet the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan and fulfill the purpose of this chapter.
      (2)   The intent of the Corridor Overlay District is to require
development along the county's thoroughfares that is aesthetically consistent,
responsive to development pressures, and proportional to the area's traffic
management issues.
   (B)   Boundaries and exemptions. The Corridor Overlay District (C-OL) shall
apply to all development sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street
hardware, and any other improvements that are visible to the public and affect
the physical development of land within the I-70, US 40, US 52, US 36/SR67, SR
9 north of Greenfield past Maxwell, the crossing of SR 234 and 200W, and CR
600W between the US 52 and US 36/SR 67 corridor overlay zones as shown on the
official zoning map or as measured 600 feet from the centerline of the corridor
street. Breaks and widths of corridor overlays can be seen on the official
zoning map. All agricultural, single and two-family residential uses shall be
exempt from the requirements of this overlay district.
   (C)   Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying district(s) are permitted
in the Corridor Overlay District. All uses that are special exceptions in the
underlying district(s) are special exceptions in the Corridor Overlay District.
   (D)   Development standards. All commercial development within the
boundaries of the Corridor Overlay District shall comply with the development
and design standards set forth in this section. The visibility and
accessibility of the land within the corridors is unique and therefore commands
the highest standards of development which stimulate substantial capital
investments, encourage efficient land use, promote coordinated development,
permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve
the integrity of the roadways within the corridors.
      (1)   Vehicular access. The corridor streets which function as primary
thoroughfares must have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location
of access points within the overlay zone. Access shall be approved by the town,
County Highway Engineer or INDOT depending on jurisdiction. To provide safe and
sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands:
         (a)   Frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads may have to
be constructed.
         (b)   Shared access shall be coordinated with contiguous lots and
designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas.
Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged.
         (c)   New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the
corridors shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible
and approved by the town, County Highway Engineer or INDOT depending on the
jurisdiction.
            1.   The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the US
40, US 52, US 36/SR 67, and CR 600W corridors.
            2.   Curb cuts shall be no closer than one foot for each 400 feet
of frontage.
            3.   No curb cuts shall be within 200 feet of any intersection of
public roads.
            4.   Opposing curb cuts shall align squarely or be offset no less
than 200 feet.
      (2)   Access to undeveloped sites. Stub streets shall be built in all
cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development.
"Reasonable potential" shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for
commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcels determined by the
County Area Plan Commission or its duly appointed or designated representative.
      (3)   Site layout.  Development plans shall include the full development
of the site. Ownership patterns may limit the degree to which this can be
shown. Plans should indicate phasing and be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of §§
156.100 et seq.
         (a)   Site layout shall consider the relationship between all
buildings on site.
         (b)   Pedestrian connectivity between uses shall be shown.
         (c)   The amount of offstreet parking located between the street and
the front facade of the building shall not exceed 80% of the total parking
requirement.
         (d)   Internal drive aisles that connect multiple lots shall minimize
points of access for safe vehicular circulation.
         (e)   The orientation and access for outlots shall be considered and
show on the plan.
      (4)   Architectural standards. The following architectural standards
shall apply to commercial facilities:
         (a)   Facade. The facade is the wall that fronts on a public or
private street. If the structure fronts onto more than two streets, the wall
that faces the streets with the highest Thoroughfare Plan classification, shall
be treated as the front facade. Facades on outlots/outparcels shall have
exterior treatments similar to that on the front facade. All front facades
shall incorporate the following elements.

      (4)   Transitional surface. These surfaces extend outward and upward at
right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended from
the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces.
Transitional surfaces for those portions of a precision approach surface which
project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance
of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and
at right angles to the runway centerline.
      (5)   Horizontal surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by
lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 5,000 for visual runways
and 10,000 for all other runways.

horizontal surface area and thence extending outwardly for a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet.
   (D)   Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided herein, no structure
or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone
created by this section to a height in excess of the height limit herein
established for the zone. The height limitations are computed from the
applicable runway and elevation or the airport elevation as appropriate, and
are hereby established for each of the zones in question. When an area is
covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation
shall prevail. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the
growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height 50
feet or less above the surface of the land.

foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point
200 feet from the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of
10,200 feet from the end of the runway, thence one foot in height for each 50
feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway.
      (2)   Non-precision instrument approach surface. Height limits shall be
one foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point
200 feet from the end of the non-precision instrument runway and extending to a
point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway.
      (3)   Transitional surface. Height limits shall be one foot in height for
each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at the primary surface edge,
measured at right angles to the longitudinal centerline of the runway,
extending upward to a maximum height of 150 feet above the established airport
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of
one foot in vertical height for each seven feet in horizontal distance measured
from the edges of all approach surfaces for the entire length of the approach
surface and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the
horizontal and conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach surface
projects through and beyond the conical surface, a height limit of one foot for
each seven feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the
edge of the instrument approach surface and extending a distance of 5,000 feet
from the edge of the precision instrument approach surface measured at right
angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (4)   Conical surface.  Height limits shall be one foot in height for
each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the
horizontal surface and measured perpendicularly to the periphery of the
horizontal surface.
   (E)   Use restrictions. No use may be made of land within any zone
established by the subchapter in a manner as to create electrical or radar
interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, making
it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others,
resulting in glare in the eyes of the flyers using the airport, impairing
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangering the
landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 156.050 PUD, INTENT, USES, AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent.  
      (1)   The purpose of these regulations is to provide greater design
flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan and the intent of the zoning and subdivision control ordinances.
      (2)   Planned unit development regulations are intended to encourage
innovations in land development techniques so that unique opportunities and
circumstances may be met with greater flexibility. Planned unit developments
should be used to address unique environmental concerns, provide a unique mix
of land uses, and implement the Comprehensive Plan in ways not considered by
the established zoning districts. A planned unit development should not be used
if the proposed development can be created using established zoning districts.
   (B)   Uses. All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the Plan
Commission. Once uses are approved by the Plan Commission, they are granted by
right. All land uses proposed in a planned unit development must be compatible
with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and the characteristics of
surrounding land uses and zoning districts.
   (C)   Development requirements. Development requirements for all proposed
planned unit developments shall be created by the applicant as part of the
preliminary plan submittal. All proposed development requirements are subject
to the review and approval of the Plan Commission and the applicable
legislative body. Generally, the planned unit development shall provide
standards for the development that replace:
      (1)   The lot standards established by §§
156.020 et seq., and
      (2)   Each topic area regulated by §§
156.060 et seq.
   (D)   Rules and procedures. All proceedings brought under this subchapter
are subject to the rules and procedures of the Plan Commission.
   (E)   Limitation of ordinance amendments. Any initiative of the Plan
Commission to amend this chapter that would affect an approved planned unit
development before its completion, shall not be enforced on the planned unit
development. New amendments to this chapter shall only apply to planned unit
developments that have been declared abandoned, or for which an approval has
expired.
   (F)   Origination of proposals.  
      (1)   Any applicant may propose a planned unit development district in
accordance with the procedures established in this subchapter. A parcel or site
proposed for a planned unit development may or may not be under single
ownership. However, if not under single ownership, the multiple owners must
have a contractual agreement:
         (a)   Not to develop the parcels separately, but in accordance with a
single, unified plan, and
         (b)   In which the separate owners have given their express intentions
to enter into such private agreements and to assure its completion as planned
and to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission.
      (2)   The legislative body may grant an extension of such time for such a
period as it deems in the public interest.

(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.071 ENTRANCE/DRIVE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of these entrance and drive standards is to
provide for a safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian transportation system
by establishing minimum standards for site entrances, driveways, and interior
drives.
   (B)   General entrance/drive standards applicable to all zoning districts.
      (1)   General requirements. All driveways and interior drives shall
conform to the following design requirements:
         (a)   Entrance widths. No entrance shall exceed the following pavement
widths at the point which they intersect the public right-of-way. The distances
for these standards shall be determined by measuring from the outside edges of
the curb or pavement (whichever is more) of the entrance or drive at the public
right-of-way which it accesses, and shall not include any acceleration or
deceleration lanes or turning radii:
            1.   Fourteen feet per lane (exclusive of any medians) if from a
nonresidential or multifamily residential use onto any type of street, and
            2.   Thirty-two feet total if from a single-family or two-family
use onto any type of street.
         (b)   Travel direction. The direction of travel for vehicles using
entrances shall be as follows:
            1.   All entrances providing access to a public right-of-way from
all lots used for purposes other than single or two-family residences shall be
designed so that vehicles are traveling in a forward direction when entering
and leaving.
            2.   In no case may any entrance for any use be designed to require
a vehicle to back onto any arterial or collector street.
         (c)   Shared entrances and drives. Shared entrances and drives are
encouraged for all uses in all zoning districts, specifically for any
multifamily residential or non-residential uses accessing a major collector or
arterial street.
            1.   Access easements.  All shared entrances and drives shall be
shall be constructed only in appropriate access easements which easements must
be recorded before usage commences.
            2.   Required documentation. A permanent documentation of any
shared entrance and drive agreement must be signed by all involved property
owners. The permanent written agreement shall include, but is not limited to
the following items: maintenance, snow removal, ownership, and liability. The
agreement, which can be amended and assigned shall be reviewed and approved by
the Town/ County Highway Engineer and duly recorded with the County Recorder.
Any changes to the agreements must be accomplished with the consent of the
Planning Director. A copy of the agreement shall be retained for the files of
the Plan Commission. The agreement shall be recorded prior to the issuance of
the occupancy permit.
         (d)   Interior drive widths.  The minimum pavement widths for
driveways and interior drives shall meet the following requirements, exclusive
of any parking spaces:
            1.   For single and two-family residential uses the minimum
driveway width shall be 12 feet.
            2.   For all multifamily uses refer to §
156.069.
         (e)   Curbs.  All entrances and interior drives for property used for
purposes other than agriculture, single-family residential, or two-family
residential shall generally be completely curbed. Curbing shall not be required
if, in the opinion of the County Surveyor/County Highway Engineer, the drainage
system for the property shall be best served if curbs were not present.
         (f)   Commercial area internal linkages.  All uses located in a
Commercial (C) zoning district shall provide interior drives that allow access
between existing and proposed commercial uses on adjacent properties.
            1.   Cross-access required. The drives must be designed as a single
two-way drive or a pair of one-way drives that provide access between the
parking lots and interior drives of all adjoining commercial uses.
            2.   Separation. Interior drives providing cross-access between

§ 156.073 TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of these telecommunication facility standards is
to provide for adequate, reliable public and private telecommunications service
while maximizing the use of transmission towers and tower sites. These
requirements also seek to minimize the adverse, undesirable visual impact of
towers through minimizing needed towers and tower sites, careful design and
siting, and screening.
   (B)   General telecommunication facility standards applicable to all zoning
districts.
      (1)   Required approvals. The placement of telecommunications facilities
shall meet the following approval requirements:
         (a)   Installation of new antenna.  The installation of new antenna(s)
on existing towers, including legal non-conforming towers, and existing
alternative structures (such as water towers, buildings, or church steeples)
may be approved by the Planning Director subject to conformance with all
applicable requirements of this chapter. New antenna that will add any height
to an existing tower, or extend over ten feet above the highest point of any
alternative structure shall be subject to the provisions of this section for
the installation of new towers as described.
         (b)   Installation of new accessory structures. The installation of
new accessory structure(s), such as equipment buildings, to support the
installation of antenna on existing towers or alternative structures may be
approved by the Planning Director subject to conformance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   Installation of new tower. The installation of any new tower(s)
shall be reviewed either by the Planning Director in the case of a permitted
use or by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a special exception use consistent
with the provisions of this section and §§
156.020 et seq.
      (2)   Abandonment.  Abandoned or unused towers or portions of towers
shall be removed as follows: The owner of a wireless facility shall file
annually a declaration with the Plan Director or his or her duly authorized
designee as to the continuing operation of every facility installed subject to
these regulations, and purchase a occupancy permit under the guidelines of §
156.100. In addition, the owner shall file annually a certificate of insurance
from the owner's insurance carrier annually a certificate of insurance from the
owner's insurance carrier listing Hancock County and the Hancock County
Commissioners as additional insureds for the purposes of general liability with
regard to bodily injury, personal injury and property damage from all possible
risks in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 per incident with a
further provision that said insurance carrier shall notify the Hancock County
Commissioners 30 days in advance of either cancellation and/or non-renewal of
said policy of insurance. Failure to do any of the above requirements shall be
determined to mean that the facility is no longer in use and considered
abandoned, thus subject to the following:
         (a)   Removal. All abandoned or unused towers and associated
facilities shall be removed within 180 days of the cessation of operations at
the site unless a time extension is approved by the Plan Director or his or her
duly authorized designee. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease
which requires the applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon
cessation of operations at a site shall be submitted at the time of
application. In the event that a tower is not removed within 180 days of the
cessation of operations at a site, the tower and associated facilities may be
removed by the county and the costs of removal, enforcement including
attorney's fees shall be assessed against the property; and/or the property
owners.
         (b)   Time constraint. Unused portions of towers above a manufactured
connection shall be removed within 180 days of the time of antenna relocation.
The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the issuance
of a new wireless facility permit.
      (3)   Required documentation. In addition to the requirements provided
elsewhere in this chapter for the receipt of a special exception approval and
an improvement location permit, applications for new towers shall include the
following:
         (a)   Engineer's report. A report from a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Indiana that:
            1.   Describes the tower height and design including a cross-
section, latitude, longitude, and elevation;
            2.   Documents the height above grade for all potential mounting
positions for co-located antenna and the minimum separation distance between
antenna;
            3.   Describes the tower's capacity, including the type and number
of antenna it can accommodate;
            4.   Documents what steps the tower owner will take to avoid
interference with established public safety telecommunication facilities; and
            5.   Includes an engineer's stamp and registration number.
         (b)   Letter of intent. A letter of intent committing the tower owner,
property owner, and their successors to allow the shared use of the tower if an
additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for
shared use.
         (c)   Proof of compliance.  Proof of compliance with all applicable
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
and Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) regulations, provided by those
agencies.
         (d)   Removal affidavit. A letter committing the property owner and
their successors to remove the tower and all related accessory structures,
fences, landscaping, and equipment if the tower is abandoned (unused for a
period of one year).
         (e)   Additional insured. The tower owner shall name Hancock County as
an additional insured.
         (f)   Determination of new tower need. Any proposal for a new
telecommunications tower shall only be approved if the applicant submits
verification from a professional engineer licensed in the State of Indiana that
the antennas planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on any
existing or approved towers or other structures within a two mile radius of the
proposed tower location due to one or more of the following reasons:
            1.   Inadequate structural capacity. The antennas would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or other structure, and
the existing or approved tower, building or other structure cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the antennas at a reasonable
cost.
            2.   Interference.  The antennas would cause interference impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower site and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
            3.   Inadequate height. The existing or approved towers or
structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at
a height necessary to function reasonably.
            4.   Unforeseen circumstances. Other unforeseen reasons that make
it unfeasible or impossible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment
upon an existing or approved tower or structure.
            5.   Commonly reasonable lease agreement. The proposed tower owner
is unable to enter a commonly reasonable lease term with the existing tower
owner or land owner.
            6.   Land availability. Additional land area is not available (when
necessary).
      (4)   Design requirements. All telecommunications facilities shall meet
the following design requirements:
         (a)   Contextual design. Towers and antennas should generally be
designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color,
camouflaging and architectural treatment, except in an instance where the color
is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation
Administration.
            1.   Wireless telecommunication towers should generally be of a
monopole design and, when located within or adjacent to an environmentally or
aesthetically sensitive area, or a residential district, be designed to
architecturally camouflage the wireless telecommunication tower as much as
reasonably practical to blend into the surroundings.
            2.   The use of residentially compatible materials such as wood,
brick, or stone is required for associated accessory structures, which shall be
designed to architecturally match the exterior of any adjacent residential or
commercial structures within the neighborhood or area.
         (b)   Lighting. Only when lighting is for safety or security reasons
or required by the FAA or other federal or state authority will it be
permitted. All ground level security lighting shall be oriented inward so as
not to project onto surrounding properties, and shall have 90 degree cut-off
luminaries (shielded downlighting).
         (c)   Co-location. All telecommunication towers shall be designed, and
engineered structurally, electrically and in all other respects to accommodate
both the applicant's equipment and at least one additional user for every 50
feet in total tower height in excess of 75 feet.
            1.   Each additional user shall be assumed to have an antenna

mulch as a ground cover or base around plantings. Lawn or an alternate living
ground cover shall be provided in all other areas. Wood mulch shall be replaced
and lawn areas shall be repaired to ensure bare ground is not left exposed for
more than a three-month period.
         (d)   Stands of native plantings, including bioswales and prairie
plantings, shall be encouraged in lieu of typical lawn. These areas shall be
maintained to minimize weed species, including Canadian thistle, cat tails,
Queen Anne's lace, clover, and other species that outcompete native forbs and
grasses. Areas of native plantings shall be mown annually.
         (e)   Parcels located within the Airport Overlay District, as defined
in §
156.043, shall follow all FAA planting restrictions and guidelines for plant
spacing, species selection, and ground cover requirements. The FAA planting
restrictions supersede requirements found within the zoning section, but they
do not relieve the owner from meeting the intent of this landscape section.
      (10)   Maintenance requirements.
         (a)   All plant material shall have a one year warranty and shall be
replaced if dead, diseased, dying, or otherwise removed before the end of the
first year following issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.

shall be allowed to:
            1.   Grow to its intended size and form; and
            2.   Mass together into hedges.
         (c)   Trees that are "topped" shall be removed and replaced with an
equivalent number of caliper inches of new trees.
         (d)   Shrubs that are sheared into individual plants shall be
supplemented with a second row of the same shrub, staggered to fill in the bare
spaces.
         (e)   Trees that pose a safety concern due to poor health, poor form,
or inappropriate location shall be removed, relocated to a more appropriate
location, trimmed under the direction of a certified arborist, or replaced with
a more appropriate species for the area.
   (B)   Overall site landscape requirement.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   All plant material provided to meet other provisions of this
section shall be counted toward the overall site landscape requirement
calculation.
         (b)   When existing stands of trees are used to meet this requirement,
the square foot area occupied by healthy, non-invasive trees to be saved and
protected during construction shall be subtracted from the overall site
acreage.

§ 156.076 RESERVED.
§ 156.077 EXTERIOR LIGHTING STANDARDS.
   (A)   General lighting standards.
      (1)   Intent. These exterior lighting standards protect the public safety
and the general welfare of the community by reducing unsafe and unpleasant
lighting conditions, such as light trespass and light pollution, while also
promoting the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians and the
security of local properties.
      (2)   Applicability; general exterior lighting standards applicable to
all new or replaced lighting in all zoning districts. The following shall be
prepared by a certified lighting specialist:
         (a)   A photometric plan, with fixture details, with each application
for an improvement location permit that requires a development plan; and
         (b)   A photometric report prior to issuance of the occupancy permit
that verifies compliance with the lighting requirements of this section.
      (3)   General requirements. All exterior lighting shall conform with the
following general requirements:
         (a)   Mounting height measurement. The mounting height of all light
fixtures shall be defined as the vertical distance between the grade level of
the surface being illuminated and the top of the lighting fixture (luminaire).
         (b)   Use of timers and dimmers. Wherever practicable, exterior
lighting shall include timers, dimmers, and/or sensors to reduce overall energy
consumption and eliminate unneeded lighting.
         (c)   Electrical service. The electrical service to all outdoor
lighting fixtures shall be buried underground unless the fixtures arc mounted
directly on buildings or utility poles.
         (d)   Holiday lighting. Seasonal holiday lighting shall be exempt from
the provisions of this section.
         (e)   Light trespass. Light trespass into the night sky and onto
neighboring properties shall be minimized with the use of dark sky approved
fixtures and appropriate lighting design.
   (B)   Lighting requirements.
      (1)   Lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting
necessary to ensure adequate vision, comfort, and safety for travel ways and
parking areas, while avoiding glare and direct illumination of adjacent
properties or streets. These lighting requirements shall apply also to interior
drives and other areas on the property used by vehicles.
      (2)   Light fixtures shall be:
         (a)   Full cutoff when adjacent to a residential use, including multi-
family and approved as a “dark sky” fixture; and
         (b)   Full cutoff or cutoff fixture when adjacent to industrial,
commercial, or institutional uses, and shall be approved as a "dark sky"
fixture.
      (3)   Lighting requirements.
         (a)   Maximum color temperature of light: 3,500 Kelvin.
         (b)   All light sources for commercial, institutional, and industrial
uses that do not have 24-hour operating hours shall be dimmable and connected
with a timer and motion sensor.
         (c)   Maximum foot candles at the site boundary for all light sources,
including but not limited to parking lots, display lots, building canopies,
monument and building signs, building wash and accent, recreation field, and
security:
            1.   Adjacent to industrial, commercial, or institutional uses: 0.5
foot candles.
            2.   Adjacent to agricultural or residential uses, including multi-
family: 0.2 foot candles.
         (d)   The minimum mounting height for street and parking lot light
fixtures shall be as follows:

and multi-family residential use sites.
            2.   Twenty-five feet within commercial and institutional use
sites.
            3.   Thirty feet within industrial use sites.
   (C)   Canopy requirements. Lighting levels under canopies for gas stations,
convenience stores, drive-up banking centers, and similar conditions shall be
adequate to facilitate the activities taking place on the property and shall
not be used for the purpose of illuminating signs, Such lighting shall conform
with the following requirements:
      (1)   All light fixtures mounted on the canopies shall be recessed so
that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of
the canopy; or
      (2)   The lighting of the canopy shall use indirect lighting through
which light is beamed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the
canopy by light fixtures that are shielded so that illumination is focused
exclusively on the underside of the canopy.
      (3)   Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides of any canopy and
the sides of the canopy shall not be illuminated. In no instances shall this be
interpreted as prohibiting the placement of signs on the canopy which are
illuminated consistent with the standards for sign illumination in this
section.
   (D)   Lighting of exterior display/sales areas. Lighting levels on exterior
display/sales areas shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place
in such locations. Such lighting shall conform with the following requirements:
      (1)   All lighting fixtures used to illuminate exterior display/sales
areas shall be cut-off or full cut-off fixtures (luminaires) focused directly
downward onto the display/sales area. Such light fixtures shall be located,
mounted, aimed, and shielded so that direct light is not cast onto adjacent
streets or properties.
      (2)   All lighting fixtures and mounting poles shall be located within
the areas being illuminated.
   (E)   Lighting of outdoor athletic/performance facilities. Lighting for all
outdoor athletic and performance facilities and events shall provide adequate
light for the event or facility while minimizing light pollution and the
illumination of adjacent streets and properties.
      (1)   Lighting fixtures for the playing fields and/or performance areas
shall be specifically mounted and aimed so that their beams fall directly
within the play/performance area and its immediate surroundings and does not
spill onto adjacent streets or properties.
      (2)   The use of spotlights and/or floodlights to illuminate the play/
performance area shall be permitted; however, each facility shall be designed
and constructed with a dual lighting system which permits the main lighting for
the event (spotlighting, floodlighting, and the like) to be turned off, with an
alternate low level lighting system used for clean-up, night maintenance and
other activities.
   (F)   Security lighting. Security lighting shall be coordinated with other
lighting on the property and shall otherwise conform with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Nonresidential areas.
         (a)   Shall be shielded and specifically aimed so that illumination is
directed only to the intended area;
         (b)   The light source for any security lighting shall include shields
that prevent their light source or lens from being visible from adjacent
properties and/or streets;
         (c)   Security lighting fixtures may be mounted on poles located no
further than ten feet from the perimeter of the area intended to be
illuminated.
      (2)   Residential areas.
         (a)   Security lighting fixtures in residential areas shall make use
of indirect and reflected lighting techniques to provide soft lighting under
canopies, entry porches, or soffits.
         (b)   The light source shall include shields that prevent the light
source or lens from being visible from adjacent properties and/or streets.
   (G)   Lighting of building façades. Building façades may be illuminated,
subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Light fixtures including wall packs and decorative lighting shall
be located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the
building façade.
      (2)   Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or
roads.
      (3)   Lighting fixtures shall be designed to wash the façade of the
building with light (rather than providing a spot or floodlight affect) and may
be directed upward or downward onto the façade.
      (4)   Buildings located within or adjacent to residential use sites shall
only provide fixtures that aim down for building wash.
      (5)   Exterior façade lighting shall be contained on the building façade
or in the landscape areas adjacent to the building and shall focus on entries
and architectural features.
   (H)   Illuminated signs. External lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall
be located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed onto only the sign
face, with minimal light spillage. Lighting fixtures shall not be aimed toward
adjacent streets, roads, or properties. In no instance shall this section be
interpreted as prohibiting the use of neon signs.

§ 156.078 NON-RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of these non-residential design standards is to
establish a minimum level of design quality while at the same time allowing
site and building design creativity and flexibility for non-residential
development.
   (B)   General standards apply to non-residential uses in the commercial,
industrial and institutional zoning districts.
      (1)   Applicability. All commercial developments shall meet or exceed the
requirements of this section, in addition to all other applicable development
standards established by this chapter. These commercial standards shall apply
to the following:
         (a)   Improvement location permit applications for new structures
submitted on or after the effective date of this chapter;
         (b)   Expansions greater than 50% of pre-existing facilities; and
         (c)   Expansions to other structures that result in a structure
greater than 20,000 square feet in gross floor area.
      (2)   General development standards.
         (a)   Site layout.
            1.   Site planning which encourages compatibilitly between the site
and the buildings and between all buildings on the site is encouraged. Where
natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to a development, they
shall be preserved and developed. Modification to topography shall be permitted
where it contributes to the overall development.
            2.   The orientation of buildings shall promote interaction with
the street and provide a pedestrian friendly environment.
            3.   Newly installed infrastructure and service revisions
necessitated by exterior alterations shall be underground. To the extent
possible, all existing overhead utilities shall be relocated underground.
            4.   All structures shall be evaluated in terms of scale, mass,
color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments.
            5.   Colors shall be subtle, harmonious and non-reflective. Accents
shall be compatible.
         (b)   Vehicular access. Major and minor arterials and major collector
streets must have reasonable restrictions as to the numbers and location of
access points within the corridor overlay zone. To provide safe and sufficient
traffic movement to and from adjacent lands:
            1.   Frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads may have
to be constructed.
            2.   Shared access shall be coordinated with contiguous lots and
designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas.
Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged.
            3.   New access points onto the major and minor arterials within
the corridor overlay zone shall be coordinated with existing access points
whenever possible and approved by the County Highway Engineer.
            4.   The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout the US
40, US 52, US 36, and CR 600W corridors.
               a.   Curb cuts shall be no closer than one foot for each 400
feet of frontage.
               b.   No curb cuts shall be within 200 feet of any intersection
of public roads.
               c.   Opposing curb cuts shall align squarely or be offset no
less than 200 feet.
         (c)   Access to undeveloped sites.
            1.   Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots
have reasonable potential for development.
            2.   Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of
adequate size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcels
determined to have reasonable potential by the County Area Plan Commission or
its duly appointed or designated representative.
         (d)   Architectural design requirements.
            1.   Exterior materials. Building facades may be constructed from
wood, stone, masonry, E.I.F.S., cement fiber board, concrete, vinyl, metal or
glass or other materials which provide the same desired quality. Products other
than those listed below must be approved by the County Area Plan Commission or
its duly appointed designees.
               a.   Buildings constructed of metal shall be permitted in the
agriculture, rural residential and industrial districts. Facades that exceed
50% metal shall contain other design elements such as concrete or masonry
bases, pitched roofs, enhanced entries or color variation.
               b.   Stone material used for masonry construction may consist of
granite, sandstone, slate, limestone, marble, or other hard and durable all
weather stone. Ashlar, cut stone, and dimension stone construction techniques
are acceptable.
               c.   Brick material used for masonry construction shall be
composed of hard fired all-weather standard size brick or other all-weather
facing brick.
               d.   Concrete finish or precast concrete panels shall be
textured using the following techniques: exposed aggregate, bush-hammered, sand
blasted, or other concrete finish as approved by the County Area Plan
Commission or its duly appointed designees. Concrete masonry units (CMU or
block) shall be textured or splitface, and otherwise not smooth.
            2.   Roof design. The materials and finishes for roofs shall
complement those materials used for the exterior walls. Roofs may be pitched or
parapet walls used to screen flat roofs.
            3.   Mechanical equipment screening. Roof-mounted equipment on
exposed roofs shall be screened from view. The appearance of roof screens shall
be coordinated with the building to maintain a unified appearance. All ground
and building mounted mechanical and electrical equipment shall be screened from
view. The screens and enclosures shall be treated as an integral element of the
building's appearance.
            4.   The exposed walls and roofs of buildings shall be maintained
in a clean, orderly, and attractive condition, and be free of cracks, dents,
punctures, breakage, and other forms of visible marring. Materials that become
excessively faded, chalked, or otherwise deteriorated shall be refinished,
repainted, or replaced.
            5.   Refuse and waste removal areas, loading berths, service yards,
storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be screened from view with
fencing, walls or landscaping.
            6.   All accessory buildings shall be constructed with materials
that are similar and compatible with materials used in the principal structure.
         (e)   Signage standards. Signage shall be designed to be an integral
part of the architectural and landscaping plans. The colors, materials, and
style of signage shall be architecturally compatible and accentuate the
buildings and landscaping on the site. The colors, materials, and lighting of
every sign shall be restrained and harmonious with the building and site to
which it principally relates. Signs shall be in conformance with §§
156.085 et seq. unless otherwise specified below.
            1.   No pole sign shall exceed 25 feet in height;
            2.   There shall be a minimum spacing of 200 feet between any pole
or ground signs located along US 40, US 52, US 36, and CR 600W; and
            3.   In no instance shall pole signs for multiple businesses, strip
commercial centers or strip business centers exceed 200 square feet of copy
area.
         (f)   Landscaping plan.  Landscaping shall be in conformance with §
156.075. Plans shall be prepared and submitted at the same time as the other
construction plans for an improvement location permit in conformance with the
requirements of §§
156.100 et seq. regarding procedures and permits.
            1.   Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local
growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate, existing trees should be
conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan; credit toward required in-
kind landscaping may be given.
            2.   The provisions for landscaping installation and maintenance
are as follows:
               a.   All landscaping required by the approved landscaping plan
shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building occupancy permit if the
permit is issued during a planting season, or within six months of the date of
occupancy if during a non-planting season.
               b.   It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their
agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with
the standards set by this subchapter and as indicated on the landscaping plan
which has been approved by the Area Plan Commission. This is to include, but is
not limited to, replacing dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable
substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.
         (g)   Parking standards. Refer to §
156.069.
         (h)   Lighting.  Refer to §
156.077.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.079 ADULT USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of these adult use standards is to establish
specific requirements for adult uses that both ensure the viability of speech
activities protected by the U.S. Constitution and prevent the land use
conflicts that result from the secondary affects of the presence of such uses.
   (B)   General adult use standards apply to the General Industrial zoning
district(s). Hancock County is aware of, and is relying on information gathered
by other communities such as Indianapolis, Indiana; New York, New York; Tucson,
Arizona, Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Houston,
Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona that demonstrates that
adult uses are distinguishable from other business uses due to their negative
impacts on the general welfare of neighboring portions of the community. Those
negative impacts include increased crime, blight, and deprivation of property
values. It has been recognized that local governments have a special concern in
regulating adult uses to ensure that the adverse effects will be minimized and
not contribute to land use conflicts and the blighting of adjacent areas. It
has been determined by the United States Supreme Court that local communities
may demonstrate this concern by, after careful review of factual information,
regulating the time, place, and manner in which adult uses occur. The intent of
this section is to preserve the character and integrity of residential
neighborhoods, to deter the spread of blight, and to protect minors from the
objectionable characteristics of adult uses. Further, it is the intent of this
section to minimize the level to which any particular commercial area is
exposed to the secondary affects of adult businesses by discouraging the
development of districts of such uses.
      (1)   Permitted use. Adult uses shall be permitted by special exception
only in the IG - Industrial: General zoning district.
      (2)   Separation requirements. Adult uses shall be located a minimum of
1,000 feet from any church, school, park, day care facility, residentially
zoned area, public or cultural facility (such as city hall, libraries, etc.),
or any other adult use. The distance shall be measured in a straight line,
without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest property
lines of the lot on which each use is located.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.080 WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purposes of this section are to:
      (1)   Assure that any development and production of wind-generated
electricity in Hancock County is safe and effective;
      (2)   Facilitate economic opportunities for local businesses and
residents;
      (3)   Promote utilization of wind energy in support of Indiana's
alternative energy sources potential; and
      (4)   Minimize potential adverse visual effects of WECS facilities
through careful design and siting standards.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this section are applicable to all
zoning districts which:
      (1)   Allow wind energy conversion systems (WECS); or
      (2)   Allow electricity generation for private use.
   (C)   Prohibition. No entity or person shall:
      (1)   Construct, operate, or locate a WECS within the county without
having fully complied with the provisions of this section; or
      (2)   Construct, operate, or locate a commercial WECS, which is defined
as a system, of any height, primarily designed to collect wind energy for
distribution and resale to a utility. A commercial WECS is also defined as:
         (a)   Two or more non-commercial WECS towers located on the same
parcel of ground;
         (b)   Four or more small WECS towers located on the same parcel of
ground; or
         (c)   One non-commercial WECS tower and two or more small WECS towers
located on the same parcel of ground.
   (D)   Conflict with other regulations. Nothing in this section is intended
to preempt other applicable state and federal laws or regulations, including
compliance with all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations
and/or the notification requirements of the FAA; nor is this section intended
to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation,
statute or other provision of law. In the event that any provision of this

§ 156.081 AGRIBUSINESS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   These standards are intended to promote agribusiness and
agritourism in Hancock County while preserving the quality and character of the
county's neighboring land uses. For purposes of this section, the term
AGRIBUSINESS refers to activities occurring on a farm that promote agriculture
and/or the profitability of fanning operations. These standards are also
intended to establish minimum criteria for agriculturally-based businesses
while preserving and fostering the diversity and economic vitality of Hancock
County farms.
      (2)   Generally, AGRIBUSINESS is a commercial enterprise involving the
production, raising, processing, distribution, and sale of agricultural and
value added agricultural products. Agribusiness may also include AGRITOURISM
venues involving public visitation of agricultural, horticultural, or
agribusiness operations for purposes of education and entertainment.
Agritourism may include both agricultural and non-agricultural activities.
      (3)   When interpreting and administering this section, attention should
be given toward categorizing broad types of venues (i.e. U-pick operation,
dairy operation with cheese making, etc.) rather than detailing or forecasting
every possible activity or event that may happen at a given location. As in any
industry, changes in current trends, customer demands, and crop performance
will affect the specific nature of activities from year to year. When
considering operations for approval the BZA is encouraged to consider general,
rather than specific, categories of activities and events.
   (B)   General requirements. An agribusiness operation may only be permitted
in association with land that is actively producing an agricultural product.
Operations and activities relating to an agribusiness shall be accessory to the
primary agricultural use of the land. An agribusiness may be allowed only in
accordance with the Land Use Matrix and Definitions sections for Agribusiness
Type 1 and Agribusiness Type 2 of this chapter. Concurrently, two or more types
of agribusiness may be conducted on the same parcel. In addition, an
agribusiness shall be subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Agribusiness Type 1. A land use associated with an Agribusiness
Type 1 shall not be subject to an improvement location permit; however, any
site improvement or structure associated with an Agribusiness Type 1 shall be
subject to an improvement location permit pursuant to the requirements of this
chapter and all applicable building codes.
         (a)   Parking. Parking areas shall not be required for an Agribusiness
Type 1.
         (b)   Hours of operation. Operations involving patrons shall be
limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except as follows:
            1.   Seasonal activities and/or special events shall cease by
midnight.
            2.   Overnight camping associated with historical reenactments,
involving fewer than 100 patrons, shall be allowed.
            3.   Extension of these hours shall be subject to BZA approval of a
special exception.
            4.   Employees and family members of the owner/operator shall be
exempt from this provision.
      (2)   Agribusiness Type 2. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review for
approval the size, scope, and duration of an Agribusiness Type 2 and the number
of any separate and distinct agribusinesses and/or agribusiness activities
sought to be operated on the land, as well as the frequency of the activities.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall, in considering whether to grant a special
exception for an Agribusiness Type 2, weigh the potential benefits of the
proposed agribusiness to the land owner and the promotion of agriculture
against the anticipated impact of the agribusiness upon surrounding landowners.
The Board shall also consider comments regarding the proposal from the County
Surveyor, County Highway Engineer, and local Fire Department. A special
exception granted to operate an Agribusiness Type 2 shall remain valid as long
as the owner/operator continues meeting the requirements of the special
exception. Notification of surrounding land owners shall be provided pursuant
to the county's standard notification procedure.
         (a)   Parking. The design and location of parking areas shall be
reviewed and approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the
parking standards of this chapter. The BZA may require additional parking areas
if overflow parking events regularly occur and/or to minimize traffic
congestion. In no instance shall parking be permitted within the public right-
of-way; the owner/operator shall take measures to ensure that vehicles do not
park in the right-of-way.
         (b)   Type 1 activities included.  A special exception to operate a
Type 2 activity shall be assumed to include all activities referenced in the
definition for Type 1 unless otherwise determined by the BZA at the time the
special exception is granted.
         (c)   Approval runs with land.  Any special exception and terms
thereof granted for an agribusiness operation shall run with the land unless
otherwise determined by the BZA.
      (3)   Improvement location and building permit required. All structures
relating to an agribusiness shall be subject to applicable zoning and building
code requirements.
      (4)   Owner/operator. The primary operator of the agribusiness shall be
the owner of the land and/or have legal control of the land, owned or rented.
      (5)   Signage. On-site directional signage (such as traffic control
signage) necessary to provide a safe and well-organized experience for guests
is encouraged. For purposes of this section, corporate branding may be utilized
provided the directional signage is not visible from the public road.
      (6)   Vehicular access. The design, installation, and maintenance of
driveway entrances for an agribusiness shall be reviewed and approved by the
County Highway Department and/or applicable agency.
      (7)   Sanitation. Temporary public toilet facilities that are visible
from public roads or located within 100 feet of residential homes shall be
screened unless otherwise approved by the Planning Director. Temporary toilet
facilities for employees required by agricultural food safety regulations are
exempt from this screening.
      (8)   Buffer yard required. Any agritourism activity, including parking
area, located within 200 feet of an established residential primary structure,
of other than the owner's, shall install a landscape buffer yard between the
activity and residential structure, as follows:
         (a)   Trees. Two broadleaf deciduous canopy trees and two evergreen
trees shall be planted for every 50 feet of boundary between the activity and
residential property line.
         (b)   Shrubs. Shrubs shall be planted along 50% of the boundary.
         (c)   Mound or wall. The plantings shall be supplemented by either:
            1.   An earth mound, at least three feet tall, with a maximum slope
of 3:1 (rise:run), or
            2.   An opaque fence/wall, at least six feet tall, of wood, brick
or stone. At least 75% of the above required plant material shall be located
outside of the fence/wall.
         (d)   Height. The minimum height of the buffer yard shall not be less
than eight feet upon maturity.
         (e)   Standards. All landscape materials required by this section
shall be subject to the landscaping standards of this chapter.
         (f)   Placement limitation. The buffer yard shall not be placed within
any easement, right-of-way, or septic field.
         (g)   Additional cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted
with trees and/or shrubs shall be covered with grass or other common landscape
material.
         (h)   Maintenance. Trees and shrubs are intended to grow, spread and
mature over time. Therefore, pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-
inhibiting measures may be used only to ensure public safety.
         (i)   Qualifying trees and shrubs. Refer to the tree and shrub species
tables in §
156.075 for the list of qualifying trees and shrubs.
      (9)   Waste/debris. The owner/operator of an agribusiness shall maintain
the site and adjacent areas in a clean, neat, and well-groomed condition. Trash
shall be collected and stored in closed containers. All dumpsters visible from
public roads or within 100 feet of residential homes shall be screened unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Director.
      (10)   Other considerations. The agribusiness shall comply with the
county's standards and regulations pertaining to, but not limited to signage,
lighting, and maximum occupancies, unless waived or modified by the Board of
Zoning Appeals. Structures relating to an agribusiness may also be subject to
state license and permit requirements for public occupancies, amusement and
entertainment. The County Planning Department shall maintain an informational
checklist of other permits and approvals that may be required to operate an
agribusiness.
      (11)   Legal non-conforming ("grandfathered") uses. An agribusiness
legally in existence prior to enactment of this section shall not be subject to
the provisions of this section. However, any such agribusiness that adds a new
and distinct Agribusiness Type 2 activity must comply with this section prior
to adding the new business. An agribusiness legally in existence pursuant to a
variance or special exception granted prior to enactment of this section shall
not be subject to the provisions of this section but shall continue to conform
to the terms of approval of the variance or special exception.

and enhance the aesthetic environment of the County; eliminate potential
hazards to motorists and pedestrians resulting from signs; and promote the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Hancock County.
   (B)   General sign standards applicable to all zoning districts.
      (1)   General requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this
subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge,
move or convert any sign within the jurisdiction of the Hancock County Area
Plan Commission, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a sign
permit. The following general sign standards apply to all signs within the
jurisdiction of the Hancock County Area Plan Commission.
         (a)   Sign permit review for permanent signs. The following procedure
applies to permanent sign/improvement location permit review.
            1.   Application. Application for a sign permit shall be filed with
the Planning Director and shall be accompanied by any information the Planning
Director determines is necessary to assure compliance with this chapter,
including but not limited to:
               a.   Clear and legible drawings with descriptions showing the
location of the sign which is the subject of the permit.
               b.   An indication of all existing and anticipated signs on the

in an action to remove an unlawful sign.
            3.   Expiration. A sign permit shall become null and void if work
has not been started within 30 days of the date the permit is issued or
completed within 180 days of the date the permit is issued.
         (b)   Measurement.  The sign area shall be calculated by multiplying
the maximum vertical dimension by the maximum horizontal dimension including
the extreme limits of characters, lettering or figures. The sign height shall
be measured from the grade at the edge of the adjacent right-of-way to the
highest point of the sign, and include any poles or other supports unless
otherwise specified in this subchapter. In no case shall sign height be
measured from the top of any berm or other artificial grade.
         (c)   Double-faced signs. For all signs permitted by this subchapter,
a double-sided sign may be erected. Only the sign area of one of the two sides
shall be considered the sign area of the entire sign. However, the two sides
shall be identical and shall be placed back-to-back, and the maximum distance
between the two sides shall not exceed two feet at any point.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 156.090 NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   (A)   Intent.  
      (1)   Upon adoption of this chapter some structures, lots, and uses that
were previously established and maintained consistent with all applicable
requirements may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district in
which they are located. For this reason, this subchapter has been written to
provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these structures,
lots, and uses; referred to as legal nonconforming. This subchapter may be
referred to as the "grandfather" clause. If a use, structure, etc. was
established legally under a previously applicable ordinance, it is described as
"grandfathered" (legal nonconforming).
      (2)   These regulations are intended to inform property owners about the
options for using and modifying nonconforming properties and to support the
eventual elimination of the nonconformities.
   (B)   Illegal nonconforming described. A structure, lot, or use that is
nonconforming and that was established or constructed without an approved
improvement location permit or approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals or
Plan Commission is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming
property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this chapter and
all other applicable county ordinances and shall be altered to conform with all
applicable standards and regulations of this chapter.
   (C)   Legal nonconforming ("grandfathered") described. Legal nonconforming
differs from illegal nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is
caused by the enactment of a zoning ordinance or a change to the zoning
ordinance (including the official zoning map). The structure, lot or use has
not changed, but due to the zoning ordinance enactment or change, the property
no longer conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is
located. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal nonconforming
or "grandfathered". Legal nonconforming lots, structures, uses, etc., may
continue in the manner and to the extent that they existed or were used at the
time the change in the zoning ordinance was enacted.
   (D)   Exemptions. Structures, uses, and other property features that are
nonconforming due to prior variance, special exception, or other approvals
shall not be subject to the provisions of this subchapter, but shall conform to
the terms of their approval.
   (E)   Repairs and maintenance. The following applies to legal nonconforming
structures, uses of structures, or uses of structures and land in combination:
      (1)   Ordinary repairs. Work may be done for ordinary repairs or
replacement of walls, heating, fixtures, wiring, plumbing, etc.; under the
condition that the nonconforming features (setbacks, lot coverage, land use,
etc.) are not increased.
      (2)   Structures declared unsafe. Nothing in this subchapter shall be
deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe
condition of any structure that has been declared unsafe by the appropriate
county official.
   (F)   Nonconforming lots of record.  All lots legally established and
recorded with the Hancock County Recorder prior to the effective date of this
chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet an applicable
provision of this chapter (such as minimum area, width, or depth) shall be
deemed legal nonconforming lots of record. Legal nonconforming lots of record
may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development
standards of the applicable zoning district of this chapter are met.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.091 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Legal nonconforming structures. Any structure (such as a primary
structure, accessory structure, fence, etc.) lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer
meets the development standards (setbacks, height, etc.) shall be deemed a
legal nonconforming structure.
   (B)   Continuation of nonconforming structures. The continuation and
modification of nonconforming structures shall be consistent with the following
requirements.
      (1)   Increases in nonconformity. No legal nonconforming structure shall
be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity without the
approval of a variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any structure may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Intentional alterations.  Any legal nonconforming structure that is
intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the discontinued legal
nonconforming features may not be resumed.
      (3)   Accidental alterations. Legal nonconforming structures that are
required to be altered or removed due to government action or damage from fire,
flood, other natural disaster, or criminal act may be restored to their legal
nonconforming condition. Such structures, if rebuilt or restored, shall be
identical or smaller in volume, height, setback, scale, and all other aspects
to that which was altered or removed.
   (C)   Exception. A legal nonconforming single-family residence located in
any commercial, industrial, or institutional zoning district may be expanded by
up to 50% of the pre-expansion living area one time in any five-calendar year
period. The expansion must be for the purpose of continuing the residential use
of the property. Required setbacks for the expansion shall be either those
established by the zoning on the property, or those provided by the pre-
expansion structure, whichever is less restrictive.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.092 NONCONFORMING SITE FEATURES.
   (A)   Legal nonconforming site features. Any site feature or improvement
(such as landscaping, dumpster enclosures, parking space dimensions, etc.)
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter, or its
subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the development standards shall be
deemed a legal nonconforming site feature.
   (B)   Continuation of nonconforming site features. The continuation and
modification of nonconforming site features shall be consistent with the
following requirements.
      (1)   Increases in nonconformity. No legal nonconforming site feature
shall be altered, removed, or otherwise modified in a manner that increases the
amount of nonconformity. Site features may be modified in a manner that
maintains or lessens the extent of the nonconformity.
      (2)   Site modifications. If building expansions or other changes to the
property occur that require corresponding site feature improvements, the
affected features shall only be required to be modified to the extent necessary
to accommodate the property changes. For example, parking lot landscaping would
only be required for new portions of a parking lot that was required to be
expanded due to a change in the use of the property - the amount of landscaping
in the preexisting parking areas will be unaffected. The required installation
of new site features shall not require the entire site to be brought into
compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 2007-1B, passed 2-5-07)
§ 156.093 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Legal nonconforming uses. Any lawful use of structures, land, or
structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of
this chapter or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in
the district where it is located shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use.
   (B)   Continuation of nonconforming uses. A legal nonconforming use may
continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   Modification of structures.  No existing structure devoted to a
legal nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except as to change
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located or as otherwise specified in this division(B)(5) below.
      (2)   New structures. No new structure shall be constructed in connection
with an existing legal nonconforming use of land.
      (3)   Expansion within structures. Any legal nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any parts of an existing structure that were plainly
arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this chapter or its
subsequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land
outside the structure.
      (4)   Expansion on the property. No legal nonconforming use of land shall
be enlarged, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of land, or moved in
whole or in part to any other portion of a lot than was occupied at the
effective date of this chapter.
      (5)   Non-conforming residential use. A legal nonconforming single-family
residence located in any commercial, industrial, or institutional zoning
district may be replaced or expanded for the purpose of continuing the
residential use of the property. Required setbacks and lot coverage for the
residence shall be either those established by the Residential (R2.5) zoning
district, or those provided by the pre-expansion structure, whichever is less
restrictive.
      (6)   Change of use (to another nonconforming use). If no structural
alterations are made, it is possible to change any nonconforming use to another
nonconforming use.
         (a)   Similar uses. Nonconforming uses may be changed to another
similar nonconforming use. For the purpose of this section similar uses shall
be considered those within the same land use categories (such as office uses,
retail uses (small scale), etc.) as provided by §§
156.020 et seq.
         (b)   Dissimilar uses. Nonconforming uses may only be changed to other
dissimilar nonconforming uses with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
For the purpose of this section dissimilar uses shall be considered those that
are not within the same land use categories (such as office uses, retail uses
(small scale), etc.) as provided by §§
156.020 et seq.
            1.   The Board may approve the change of use if it finds that the
proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district in which it is
located than the existing use.
            2.   The Board shall consider the development standards applicable
to the proposed use established by this chapter and may make reasonable
conditions as part of any approval.
      (7)   Change of use (to a permitted use). When a legal nonconforming use
is replaced by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming use may not
be resumed.
      (8)   Discontinuation of use. If a legal nonconforming use is
intentionally discontinued for 12 continuous months or longer, any subsequent
use of such land, structure, or land and structure in combination shall conform
to the provisions of this chapter.
         (a)   Exemptions.  Uses that are required to be discontinued due to
government action that impedes access to the premises or damage from fire,
flood, other natural disaster, or criminal act shall be exempt from this
provision.
         (b)   Exemption conditions. Such exempt uses, if restored, shall be
identical in scale, lot coverage, and all other aspects to that which was
discontinued.
      (9)   Nonconforming structures and land in combination. Where legal
nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, an
intentional removal or alteration of the structure, or its use, that
establishes conformity shall also eliminate the legal nonconforming status of
the land. Legal nonconforming uses located in structures specifically
constructed or modified to suit only such use are exempt from this provision
and may be resumed if the structure has not been intentionally altered to serve
other uses, used to house a permitted use, or used to house another
nonconforming use with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals as specified
in division (B)(5) above.
      (10)   NOTE: EXAMPLE OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND LAND IN COMBINATION.
Legally established apartment units located in a single family dwelling zoning
district at the effective date of this chapter may continue to be used as
apartments after a period of vacancy if the structure has not been modified to
physically remove the apartments.

§ 156.094 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Legal nonconforming signs. Any sign, lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer
meets the development standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign.
   (B)   Sign defined. For the purposes of this subchapter, a sign shall
include the sign face and any supports, poles, frames, or other associated
lighting, electrical, mechanical, and structural features.
   (C)   Continuation of nonconforming signs.  The continuation and
modification of nonconforming signs shall be consistent with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Increases in nonconformity. No legal nonconforming sign shall be
enlarged or altered in terms of face area, height, or any other aspect that
increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Intentional alterations. Any legal nonconforming sign that is
intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the discontinued legal
nonconforming features may not be resumed.
      (3)   Accidental alterations. Legal nonconforming signs that are required
to be altered or removed due to government action or damage resulting from
fire, flood, other natural disaster, or a criminal act may be restored to their
legal nonconforming condition. Such signs, if rebuilt or restored, shall
conform with the requirements of this chapter, or shall be identical in scale
and all other aspects to that which was altered or removed.
      (4)   Sign faces and messages. The sign faces and/or message on a legal
nonconforming sign may be altered, replaced, repainted, and repaired provided
that the nonconformity of the sign is not increased. Nothing in this suchapter
shall be interpreted as requiring a sign to be brought into conformance with
this chapter if it is changed only to the extent that the face area is changed,
but not increased in size or altered in shape.
      (5)   Temporary signs. Any signs in existence at the time this chapter
becomes effective that were previously permitted as temporary signs may only
remain in use consistent with the requirements of this chapter. Any temporary
signs that are no longer permitted shall be removed within 60 days of the
effective date of this chapter. Any nonconforming temporary signs shall be
considered to be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the
provisions of §§
156.115 et. seq.

following procedure shall apply to all variance applications.
   (A)   Application. The applicant shall submit a variance application,
affidavit and consent of property owner (if the owner is someone other than the
applicant), a copy of the deed for the property involved, the required filing
fee, and required supporting information. Supporting information shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Site plan.  A site plan shall be signed and dated. The site plan

Planning Director and clearly show the entire layout of the property with all
features relevant to the variance request.
      (2)   Statement of intent. A statement of intent to the Board of Zoning
Appeals describing the details of the variance being requested and stating how
the request is consistent with the required findings of fact. The statement

   (B)   Notification. Notification for the scheduled public hearing regarding
the variance request shall be completed consistent with §
 156.101 and the rules and procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (C)   Public hearing. The BZA will then, in a public hearing scheduled
consistent with the adopted calendar of filing and meeting dates, review the

         (a)   Approval. The application shall be approved if a determination
in writing is made consistent with the decision criteria listed in division (D)
below.
         (b)   Approval with modifications. The application shall be approved
with modifications if the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that the
requirements of division (D) below may be met if certain conditions are applied
to the application. The Board may make reasonable conditions related to the
required decision criteria in division (D) below, part of its approval and/or
accept written commitments from the applicant.
         (c)   Denial. The application shall be denied if a determination in
writing consistent with the decision criteria listed in division (D) below is

following decision criteria, consistent with the requirements of the Indiana
Code.
      (2)   Development standards variance. The Board may grant a variance from
the development standards of this chapter (such as height, bulk, area) if,
after a public hearing, it makes a determination in writing, consistent with IC
36-7-4-918.5, that:
         (a)   General welfare. The approval will not be injurious to the
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;
         (b)   Adjacent property.  The use and value of the area adjacent to
the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially
adverse manner; and
         (c)   Practical difficulty.  The strict application of the terms of
this chapter will result in a practical difficulty in the use of the property.
This situation shall not be self-imposed, nor be based on a perceived reduction
of, or restriction on, economic gain.
   (E)   Conditions.  The Board may impose such reasonable conditions upon its
approval as it deems necessary to find that the decision criteria for approval
have been met.
   (F)   Commitments. The Board may require the owner of the property to make
written commitments concerning the use or development of the property as
specified under I.C. 36-7-4-921. Such commitments shall be recorded in the
Hancock County Recorder's Office. A copy of the recorded commitments shall be
provided to the Planning Director for inclusion in the petition file at the

permit shall be issued for a permit application which does not comply with the
recorded commitments.
   (G)   Limitations.  
      (1)   The following limitations shall apply to the execution of a
variance approval.
      (2)    Development standards variance. A development standards variance

§ 156.107 DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   Intent.  
      (1)   The intent of this subchapter is to provide for the adequate,
consistent review of new development to ensure consistency with the zoning
ordinance; accommodate traffic and utility systems; and address the unique
characteristics of certain areas of development. Development plan review is
provided for by the I.C. 36-7- 4-1400 series. The development plan review
process is not intended to provide an alternative to rezoning, variance,
special exception, platting, or other established procedures; but rather to
allow for the administrative review of site conditions and development plans
for consistency with applicable requirements prior to the issuance of permits.
      (2)   Generally, development plan review shall involve new non-
residential and residential (multifamily and subdivision) development and shall
occur after rezoning and primary plat approvals. Development plan review may
occur before or after any necessary Board of Zoning Appeals applications based
on the characteristics of each application.
      (3)   The following process and requirements apply to all new site
development.
   (B)   Authority and process outline.
      (1)   Development plan required. Development plan approval may be
required upon the discretion of the Board of Zoning Appeals and the Plan
Commission.
      (2)   Exemptions.  The following types of development shall be exempt
from the requirements of this subchapter, but shall be required to obtain an
improvement location permit and/or any other permit or approval otherwise
required by this chapter.
         (a)   Sign installation. The replacement or installation of any sign
(s) not occurring as part of an improvement to any other aspect of the
property.
         (b)   Parking lot expansion. The expansion of an existing parking lot
that does not
result in:
            1.   A greater than 25% or 2,000 square foot (whichever is greater)
increase in the surface area of the parking previously available on the
property;
            2.   The demolition of any structure; or
            3.   The need for modifications to street accesses.
         (c)   Structural expansion. The expansion of an existing structure or
the construction of an accessory structure that does not result in a greater
than 25% increase in the floor area of the structures that were previously
existing on the property and does not require the provision of additional
landscaping, parking, or other improvements regulated by this chapter (building
permit).
         (d)   Residential use/structure. The placement of an individual
manufactured home or the construction or expansion of a single-family
residential use and structure (building permit).
      (3)   Review and approval authority. The Planning Director, or his
designee, in their role as staff for the Plan Commission, shall have the
authority to review and approve development plans in conjunction with the
Technical Committee as required by this subchapter.
         (a)   Waiver of requirements. Neither the Planning Director nor the
Area Plan Commission shall have the authority to waive any requirement of this
chapter in the review of a site development plan. All variances from the terms
of this chapter shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
         (b)   Revision process. The procedure for the review of proposed
amendments or revisions to previously approved site development plans shall
follow the process for the initial approval of site development plans outlined
in this subchapter.
      (4)   Process outline.  A preliminary informal meeting shall be held with
county staff prior to application submittal. The process is illustrated below
and detailed in division (C) below.
