(1980 Code, § 34.20) (Ord. 2001-3, passed 3-13-2001)
§ 34.41 PURCHASING POLICY FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED GOODS, MATERIALS AND SERVICES.
   (A)   For purchasing with no federal involvement, the city will follow state
law outlined in I.C. 5-22 et seq., as well as any other applicable state and
city provisions.
   (B)   For purchasing involving federal funds or federal oversight, the
following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The city will maintain records sufficient to detail the history of
procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Rationale for the method of procurement;
         (b)   Selection of contract type;
         (c)   Contractor selection or rejection; and
         (d)   The basis for the contract price.
      (2)   Informal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement for
property or services under a federal award does not exceed the simplified
acquisition threshold (SAT), as defined by federal law, formal procurement
methods are not required. The city may use informal procurement methods to
expedite the completion of its transactions and minimize the associated
administrative burden and cost. The informal methods used for procurement of
property or services at or below the SAT include:
         (a)   Micro-purchases.
            1.   Distribution. The acquisition of supplies or services, the
aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold
established by federal law. To the maximum extent practicable, the city should
distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
            2.    Micro-purchase awards. Micro-purchases may be awarded without
soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the city considers the price
to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other
information and documents it files accordingly.
            3.    Micro-purchase thresholds. The city adopts the federally
determined threshold for micro purchases, reserving the right to increase the
threshold based on an evaluation of risk.
            4.   If the city decides on a threshold above the federal standard,
the city must include all of the following:
               a.   A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with
the federally set criteria for the most recent audit;
               b.   An annual internal institutional risk assessment to
identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or
               c.   For public institutions, a higher threshold consistent with
state law.
            5.   If the city increases the micro-purchase threshold over
$50,000, it must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The
city must submit a request with all federal requirements. The increased
threshold is valid until there is a change in status in which the justification
was approved.
         (b)   Small purchases.
            1.   Small purchase procedures. The acquisition of property or
services, the aggregate dollar amount ofwhich is higher than the micro-purchase
threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Price or
rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources
as determined appropriate by the City Council.
            2.   Simplified acquisition thresholds. The city adopts the federal
simplified acquisition threshold.
         (c)   Formal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement
for property or services under a federal financial assistance award exceeds the
SAT, formal procurement methods are required. Formal procurement methods
require following documented procedures. Formal procurement methods also
require public advertising unless a non-competitive procurement can be used in
accordance with federal law. The following formal methods of procurement are
used for procurement of property or services above the simplified acquisition
threshold or a value below the simplified acquisition threshold:
            1.   Sealed bids. Bids shall be publicly solicited and a firm
fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible
bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the
invitation for bids, is the lowest in price.
            2.   Sealed bids applicability. Sealed bids will be used when the
following conditions are present:
               a.   A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or
purchase description;
               b.   Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to
compete effectively for the business; and
               c.   A firm fixed price contract and the selection of the
successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.
            3.   If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
               a.   Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified
sources, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for
opening the bids, for local, and tribal governments, the invitation for bids
must be publicly advertised;
               b.   The invitation for bids, which will include any
specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in
order for the bidder to properly respond;
               c.   All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in
the invitation for bids, and for local and tribal governments, the bids must be
opened publicly;
               d.   A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing
to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs
must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will
only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such
discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
               e.   Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound
documented reason.
            4.   Proposals. A procurement method in which either a fixed price
or cost reimbursement type contract is awarded. Proposals are generally used
when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. They are
awarded in accordance with the following requirements:
               a.    Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Proposals must be solicited
from an adequate number of qualified offerors. Any response to publicized
requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical;
               b.   The city will hire experts to provide technical evaluations
of the proposals received and advice making selections;
               c.    Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose
proposal is most advantageous to the city, with price and other factors
considered; and
               d.   The city may use competitive proposal procedures for
qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E)
professional services whereby offeror's qualifications are evaluated and the
most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and
reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection
factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot
be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms that are a
potential source to perform the proposed effort.
         (d)   Noncompetitive procurement. There are specific circumstances in
which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can
only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
            1.   The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar
amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold;
            2.   The item is available only from a single source;
            3.   The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not
permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;
            4.   The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly
authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from
the city; or
            5.   After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is
determined inadequate.
      (3)   The city shall conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the
use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal
geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in
those cases where applicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage
geographic preference.
      (4)   When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services,
geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application
leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of
the project, to compete for the contract.
      (5)   The city will follow procedures outlined in CFR 180.300,
particularly that it will verify that the person with whom the city intends to
do business is not excluded or disqualified, by checking (a) SAM Exclusions;
(b) collecting a certification from that person; or (c) adding a clause or
condition to the covered transaction with that person.

(Ord. 2017-10, passed 6-13-2017)
§ 50.09 INTERCONNECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   A customer desiring to interconnect renewable generation facilities
with the utility's grid for the purpose of offsetting the customer's electric
load shall complete an interconnection application and submit the application
to the utility for review. After receipt of the application, the utility shall
conduct such further inspection of the renewable generation facilities as the
utility deems necessary and approve or deny the application. The utility is
hereby authorized to charge a reasonable application and inspection fee to
offset costs involved with reviewing the application, inspecting the renewable
generation facilities, and otherwise ensuring compliance with this section.
   (B)   If the interconnection application is approved, then the customer
agrees that no changes shall be made to the configuration of the renewable
generation facilities, as that configuration is described in the application,
and no relay or other control or protection settings specified in the
application shall be set, reset, adjusted or tampered with, except to the
extent necessary to verify that the renewable generation facilities comply with
the utility's approved settings.
   (C)   In addition to such other requirements as the utility deems necessary,
any renewable generation facility allowed to interconnect to the utility's grid
must comply with: (a) the National Electrical Code and the National Electrical
Safety Code, as each may be revised from time to time; (b) the utility's rules
and regulations and the utility's General Terms and Conditions for Electric
Service, each as contained in the utility's Electric Tariff and each as may be
revised from time to time; and (c) all other applicable local, state, and
federal codes and laws, as the same may be in effect from time to time.
   (D)   For any approved renewable generation facilities interconnected to the
utility's grid, the customer shall install, operate, and maintain, at the
customer's sole cost and expense, the renewable generation facilities in
accordance with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers'
applicable Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric
Power Systems, as it may be amended from time to time. The customer shall be
responsible for protecting, at the customer's sole cost and expense, the
renewable generation facilities from any condition or disturbance on the
utility's electric system, including, but not limited to, voltage sags or
swells, system faults, outages, loss of a single phase of supply, equipment
failures, and lightning or switching surges.
   (E)   The customer shall operate any interconnected renewable generation
facilities in such a manner as not to cause undue fluctuations in voltage,
intermittent load characteristics or otherwise interfere with the operation of
the utility's electric system. At all times when the renewable generation
facilities are being operated in parallel with the utility's electric system,
the customer shall operate the renewable generation facilities in a manner that
no disturbance will be produced to the service rendered by the utility to any
ofits other customers or to any electric system interconnected with the
utility's electric system. The customer's control equipment for the renewable
generation facilities shall immediately, completely, and automatically
disconnect and isolate the renewable generation facilities from the utility's
electric system in the event of a fault on the utility's electric system, a
fault on the customer's renewable generation facilities, or loss of a source or
sources on the utility's electric system. The automatic disconnecting device
included in such control equipment shall not be capable of reclosing until
after service is restored on the utility's electric system. Additionally, if
the fault is with the customer's renewable generation facilities, such
automatic disconnecting device shall not be reclosed until after the fault is
isolated from the customer's renewable generation facilities.
   (F)   Upon reasonable advance notice to the customer, the utility shall have
access to any interconnected renewable generation facilities to perform on-site
inspections to verify that the installation and operation of the renewable
generation facilities comply with the requirements of this section and to
verify the proper installation and continuing safe operation of the renewable
generation facilities. The utility shall also have at all times immediate
access to breakers or any other equipment that will isolate the renewable
generation facilities from the utility's electric system. The utility shall not
be responsible for any costs the customer may incur as a result of such
inspection(s). The utility shall have the right and authority to isolate
approved interconnected renewable generation facilities at the utility's sole
discretion if the utility believes that: (a) continued interconnection and
parallel operation of the renewable generation facilities with the utility's
electric system creates or contributes (or will create or contribute) to a
system emergency on either the utility's or the customer's electric facilities;
(b) the renewable generation facilities are not in compliance with the
requirements of this section; or (c) the renewable generation facilities
interfere with the operation of the utility's electric system. In non-emergency
situations, the utility shall give the customer reasonable notice prior to
isolating the renewable generation facilities.
   (G)   The customer shall procure and keep in force during all periods of
parallel operation of the renewable generation facilities with the utility's
electric system, homeowners, commercial, or other insurance to protect the
interests of the utility as a named insured, with insurance carriers acceptable
to the utility, and in amounts not less than those reasonably determined by the
utility to be necessary taking into consideration the nameplate capacity,
configuration and type of the renewable generation facilities. The customer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the utility, the City of Columbia City, its
employees, officers, elected officials, representatives, agents and
subcontractors from and against all claims, liability, damages and expenses,
including attorney's fees, based on any injury to any person, including the
loss of life, or damage to any property, including the loss of use thereof,
arising out of, resulting from, or connected with, or that may be alleged to
have arisen out of, resulted from, or connected with, an act or omission by the
customer, its employees, agents, representatives, successors or assigns in the
construction, ownership, operation or maintenance of the customer's renewable
generation facilities. If the utility is required to bring an action to enforce
its rights under this division, either as a separate action or in connection
with another action, and said rights are upheld, the customer shall reimburse
the utility for all expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection
with such action.
   (H)   If a customer owning or leasing a renewable generation facility
produces more energy from such facility than the customer's electric load at
that meter, then the excess energy shall be purchased from the customer by IMPA
pursuant to the terms of a separate power purchase agreement between the
customer and IMPA. The utility shall own any meter used to measure output of
energy from the customer's renewable generation facility.
   (I)   It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to connect or maintain
the connection of a renewable generating facility to the utility's grid without
obtaining the utility's approval of an interconnection application. Any person
or entity found to be in violation of this section shall be fined not less than
$500, nor more than $2,500 for each such violation, plus costs. In addition to
the foregoing fines and at the utility's sole discretion, property where a
renewable generating facility is unlawfully connected to the utility's grid may
be disconnected from the utility's grid until an interconnection application is
approved. Every day that a violation of this section occurs shall constitute a
separate offense.

§ 51.08 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior
lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear
building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
   (B)   Existing sewers may be used in connection with new construction when
they are found on examination and test by the Inspector to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, A.S.T.M.
specification or equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, A.S.T.M. specification or
equal; or other suitable material approved by the Inspector. Joints shall be
tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten
feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe with
leaded joints. Cast iron pipes with leaded joints may be required by the
Inspector where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If
installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast
iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material maybe accepted if laid on a
suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the Inspector.
   (D)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made by the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If

branch is available, the owner shall at his or her expense install a “Y” branch
in the public sewer at the location specified by the Inspector. Where the
public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located “Y”
branch is available, a saddle type fitting may be cut in the public sewer to
receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction of an angle
of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree elbow may be used to make such connection,
with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the
public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall
be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A
smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight
by encasement in concrete. Fittings may be used for the connection only when
approved by the Inspector.
   (E)   The owner (or the owner’s contractor or legal representative) seeking
to connect to the city’s sewer shall notify the Inspector when the building’s
sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The
connection shall be made under the supervision of the Inspector or his or her
representative.
   (F)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. The
property owner shall be responsible for any necessary permits.

§ 51.11 GREASE, OIL, AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   Scope and purpose. The purpose of this section is to control
discharges into the public sewerage collection system and POTW that interfere
with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines,
interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls and contribute
waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is
beyond the treatment capability of the POTW.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      FATS, OILS AND GREASES. Material composed primarily of fats, oils and
greases (FOG) from animal or vegetable sources. The terms FATS, OILS AND
GREASES shall be deemed as GREASE by definition. These substances are
detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures established in the
40 C.F.R. 136, as may be amended from time to time. GREASE does not include
petroleum base products.
      FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT. Those establishments engaged in activities of
preparing, serving or otherwise making available for consumption by the public,
including but not limited to, restaurants, commercial kitchens, churches,
clubs, caterers, hotels, schools, hospitals, prisons, correctional facilities
and care institutions. These establishments use one or more of the following
preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods),
grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling,
blanching, roasting, toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared heating,
searing, barbecuing and any other food preparation activity that produces a
hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
      GREASE INTERCEPTOR. A structure or device designed for the purpose of
removing and preventing fats, oils and greases from entering the sanitary sewer
collection system. These devices are below-ground units in outside areas and
are built as two or three chamber baffled tanks.
      GREASE TRAP. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and
grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are compact under-
the-sink units that are near food preparation areas. These devices also serve
to collect settleable solids, generated by and from food preparation
activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer
collection and treatment system.
      INDIANA PLUMBING CODE. References herein to the Indiana Plumbing Code
shall mean Indiana Administrative Code (I.A.C.) 675 164.3, as amended or
replaced. Application of the INDIANA PLUMBING CODE to the provisions of this
section and the enforcement thereof shall always be the application and
interpretation of the most current version of the code section.
      MAILING. For purposes of mailing documents and receipt thereof, notices
shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery shall
be deemed made on the date signified on the return receipt. Notices may also be
hand delivered with receipt determined on the date of such delivery.
      MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY. The design features of a grease interceptor
and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases
from grease-laden wastewater discharged to the public sanitary sewer.
      POTW or PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS. A treatment works which is owned
by a municipality as defined by § 502(4) of the Clean Water Act. This
definition includes any devices and systems used in the storage, treatment,
recycling and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid
nature. It also includes all sewers, pipes and other conveyances that transfer
wastewater to a POTW. The term also means the municipality as defined in § 502
(4) of the Act, which has jurisdiction over the indirect discharges to and the
discharges from such a treatment works. For purposes of this section, the terms
SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM and POTW may be used interchangeably.
      SAND, SOIL AND OIL INTERCEPTORS. Approved and industry standard system
that is specifically designed and manufactured to separate sand, soil and oil
from water. The system shall allow the sand, soil and oil to be collected and
removed on a regular basis as to prevent it from being discharged into the
wastewater collection system.
      USER. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional
limits of the city, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into sewers within the wastewater service area,
including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as
those who discharge hauled wastewater.
   (C)   General criteria.
      (1)   Installation requirements. All existing, proposed or newly
remodeled food service facilities inside the city wastewater service area shall
be required to install, at the user’s expense, and approved, properly operated
and maintained grease interceptor or trap which complies with the Indiana
Plumbing Code.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories and the like shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These
flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
      (3)   Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
      (4)   Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste
products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a
grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap, although it
may decrease the operational capacity of the grease hap, which will require an
increased pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation.
      (5)   Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease
trap unless discharge water exceeds 140°F/60°C, at which time temperature
equalization equipment must be used before discharge enters the collection
system. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and
allow it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Therefore, grease traps
must be sized accordingly to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool
and grease to solidify and float to the top of the trap.
      (6)   Location. Grease trap shall be installed inside the building
upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow
easy access for inspection, cleaning and removal of the intercepted grease at
any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building
without written approval by the Columbia City/Whitley County Planning/Building
Department (herein often referred to as “Joint Building Department”).
      (7)   Pass through limits. No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentrations from the grease trap to exceed 100 mg/l (milligrams per liter)
as identified by EPA test method 1664.
   (D)   Discharge criteria.
      (1)   Where fats and greases are a byproduct of food preparation and/or
cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be made to separate fats and greases into a
separate container for proper disposal. Fats and greases shall not be
discharged to any drains or grease interceptors, except as contained in
byproducts of food preparation and/or clean up. Such waste shall be placed in a
container designed to hold such waste and either utilized by the industry or
disposed of at suitable locations.
      (2)   None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease
interceptor, or into any drain that leads to the interceptor:
         (a)   Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes,
degreasers or any type of product that will liquefy grease interceptor wastes;
         (b)   Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; or
         (c)   Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid
contents of the grease interceptor to the POTW.
      (3)   The influent to grease interceptors or grease traps shall not
exceed 140°F/60°C.
   (E)   Grease interceptor requirements.
      (1)   Grease interceptor sizing and installation shall conform to the
Indiana Plumbing Code.
      (2)   Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with design
approved by the Joint Building Department and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
      (3)   Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it shall
be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of intercepted
grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building
where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the
approval of the Joint Building Department.
      (4)   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design
capability. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
         (a)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance
with the Indiana Plumbing Code;
         (b)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required
to maintain minimum design capability; and
         (c)   Keep grease interceptors free of inorganic solid materials such
as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags
and the like, which could settle in the interceptor and thereby reduce the
effective volume of the device.
      (5)   Access manholes shall be provided over each grease interceptor
chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished
grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration.
The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection,
grease removal and wastewater sampling activities.
      (6)   Grease interceptors required under this section shall be installed
in all food service facilities unless the Joint Building Department authorizes
the installation of an indoor grease trap or other alternative pretreatment
technology and determines that the installation of a grease interceptor is not
feasible. If a facility believes the installation of a grease interceptor is
infeasible, because of documented space constraints, the request for an
alternative grease removal device shall contain the following information:
         (a)   Location of sewer main and easements in relation to available
exterior space; and
         (b)   General information about existing plumbing at the site.
   (F)   Grease trap maintenance and design.
      (1)   Cleaning/pumping. The user, at the user’s expense, shall maintain
all grease traps to assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain
compliance with the city’s pass through limits. Maintenance of grease traps
shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating
materials, wastewater and bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be
performed by a qualified and licensed hauler. Decanting or discharging of
removed waste back into the trap from which it was removed or any other grease
trap, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.
This service shall also include a thorough inspection of the trap and its
components. Any needed repairs shall be noted by the inspecting city
representative, provided in writing to the user, and repaired at the user’s
expense.
      (2)   Disposal. All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed
of at a facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the
provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any
private or public portion of the city’s sanitary sewer collection system. All
pumpage from grease traps must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms
pumping, hauling and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and retain a
copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
      (3)   Maintenance log. A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating
each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each food
service facility. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler
and disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection.
The log shall be made available to the Joint Building Department or POTW
representative upon request.
      (4)   Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease trap
shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall
have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
      (5)   Construction. Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with
Indiana Plumbing Code standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments
with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal devices or
technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the Joint Building
Department. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies
of the proposed technology.
      (6)   Access. Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to
allow for their maintenance and inspection.
      (7)   Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas.)
      (8)   Sand, soil and oil interceptors. All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, car and truck maintenance facilities, fabricators,
utility equipment shops and other facilities (as determined by the Indiana
Plumbing Code) that have sources of sand, soil and oil shall install effective
sand, soil and oil traps, interceptors and/or oil/water separators. These
systems shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil and oil at the expected
flow rates. These systems shall be, at the user’s expense, cleaned or pumped on
a regular basis to prevent impact upon the wastewater collection and treatment
systems. Users whose systems are deemed to be ineffective by the Joint Building
Department shall be asked to change the cleaning frequency or to increase the
size of the system. Owners or operators of washing facilities will be required
to prevent the inflow of detergents and rainwater into the wastewater
collection system. Oil/water separator installations shall be required at
facilities that accumulate petroleum oils and greases and at facilities deemed
necessary by the Joint Building Department.
      (9)   Laundries. Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that
prevents passage (into the wastewater collection system) of solids one-half
inch or larger in size such as rags, strings, buttons or other solids
detrimental to the system.
      (10)   Control equipment. The equipment or facilities installed to
control FOG, food waste, sand, soil, oil and lint must be designed in
accordance with the Indiana Plumbing Code, most current engineering standards,
or other applicable guidelines approved by the Joint Building Department.
Underground equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater
and shall be easily accessible to allow regular maintenance and inspection.
Control equipment shall be maintained by the owner and/or operator of the
facility as to prevent a stoppage of the wastewater collection system, and the
accumulation of FOG, food waste, sand and lint in the collection lines, pump
stations and POTW. If the city is required to clean out the wastewater
collection lines, as a result of a stoppage resulting from poorly maintained
control equipment (or lack thereof) the owner or operator shall be required to
refund the labor, equipment, materials and any overhead costs to the city
including any fines incurred due to any sanitary sewer overflow due directly to
the stoppage. The city retains the right to inspect and approve any and all
installations of control equipment. The city, through the Joint Building
Department, reserves the right to request additional control measures if
existing control equipment is shown to be insufficient to protect the
wastewater collection system and POTW from interference due to the discharge of
FOG, sand, soil, lint or any other undesirable materials.
   (G)   Violation.
      (1)   Any person who violates this section, in part or whole, shall be
guilty of a civil violation punishable under and according to the general
penalty provision of the city’s Municipal Code of Ordinances. Each day’s
violation of this section shall be considered a separate offense.
      (2)   It is unlawful for any user to discharge into the POTW in any
manner that is in violation of this section, or of any condition set forth in
this section. Additionally, a person commits an offense if the person causes or
permits the plugging of, blocking of or otherwise interferes with or permits
interference with a grease interceptor or the POTW, including alteration or
removal of any flow constricting devices so as to cause flow to rise above the
design capacity of the interceptor.
      (3)   No person, and/or facility shall discharge grease to the POTW,
except as expressly authorized by this section. If such discharge occurs, the
person or facility shall be considered in violation of this section and subject
to the remedies described herein.
      (4)   In addition to prohibiting certain conduct by natural persons, it
is the intent of this section to hold a corporation, association, LLC, LLP, PS
or other entity of organization legally responsible for prohibited conduct
performed by an agent action on behalf of such an entity and within the scope
of his or her office or employment.
      (5)   The POTW may recover the fees and costs imposed by this section in
a civil action and may pursue any other remedy available at law or in equity to
address a violation of this section or to enforce compliance with it.

§ 51.22 RATES FOR DISCHARGE OF WATER OBTAINED FROM OTHER THAN CITY WATER
SUPPLY.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates. Further, as
is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such
quantities cannot and do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (B)   (1)   In the event sewage services are provided to single-family or
multiple-family residential users, and such users have a supply of water not
provided by the municipal waterworks, then such user, at the option of such
user, shall be charged either (a) pursuant to such user’s metered well water
usage or (b) as provided in the following table:
 
Effective Date                               City User Rural User
First full billing cycle after March 1, 2015 $ 57.00   $ 57.00
First full billing cycle after March 1, 2016 63.00     63.00
First full billing cycle after March 1, 2017 68.00     68.00
 
      (2)   For purposes of this section, a DWELLING UNIT shall be defined as
any space in which cooking or eating facilities are provided.
      (3)   In the event a residential user subject to this section elects to
have their well metered, such user shall notify the Clerk-Treasurer of the
user’s election to have their well metered and such metering shall apply to the
user’s next full billing cycle.
   (C)   In the event any user, other than residential, is not a user of the
municipal supply of water, has a supply of water other than municipal used in
or on the premises, uses a supply of water in a product, has a portion of the
water used in or on the premises diverted away from the sanitary sewer system,
or, if for any other reason, the measurement of the municipal supply of water
in or on the premises is not an accurate measurement of the sanitary effluent
discharged into the city sanitary system, then the amount of water discharged
to the sanitary system shall be otherwise measured or determined. In such
event, the owner or other interested party shall install and maintain at his or
her expense meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any other adequate
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of
sewage discharge.
   (D)   In order that the single-family domestic and residential users of
sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer
months of June, July, August, and September, the billing for sewage service for
residential or domestic users for said months shall be based on the water usage
for the previous month of April. In the event the water usage for the previous
month of April is greater than the water usage for the summer month, then the
billing for sewage services shall be computed on the actual water used in the
month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic or
residential sewage service as applicable to the sprinkling rate shall apply to
each lot, parcel of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a
single-family residence. Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises
which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes. In
the event a portion of such premises shall be used for commercial or industrial
purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water served
through a separate meter purchased and maintained at the owner’s expense, and
in such case, the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such
portion of the premises used for residential purposes shall qualify for the
sprinkling rate.

   For city and rural residential users who receive city water but are not
connected to city sewage services when such services are located within 300
feet of such user’s property line, such residential user shall be charged a
monthly sewer availability fee. The sewer availability fee shall be the sum of
$20 per month, which sum may be modified from time to time by the city.

§ 51.24 EXCESSIVE STRENGTH SURCHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the city shall base its
charges not only on the volume but also on the strength and character of
stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat
and dispose of. The city shall require the industrial user to determine the
strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or
indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system in such manner and by such method
as the city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case in order to determine the proper charge. In all
cases, the cost of measuring and monitoring will be borne by the industrial
user. The industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point available to
the city at all times.
   (B)   Normal domestic sewage waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, or total suspended solids
in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based on total suspended solids (TSS). There shall
be an additional charge per pound of total suspended solids (TSS) received in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid as set forth in division (B)(4) of
this section.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based on B.O.D. There shall be an additional charge
per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for B.O.D. received in excess of 250
milligrams per liter of fluid as set forth in division (B)(5) of this section.
      (3)    There shall be an additional charge per pound of nitrogen, ammonia
received in excess of 25 milligrams per liter (25mg/l) as set forth in division
(B)(5) of this section.
      (4)   Rate surcharge based on Phosphorus. There shall be an additional
charge per pound of Phosphorus received in excess of 1 milligram per liter of
fluid as set forth in division (B)(5) of this section.
      (5)   Rate surcharge based on oil & grease. There shall be an additional
charge per pound of Hexanesoluble matter (oil & grease), nor more than 25 mg/
L total soluble oil & grease not more than 100 mg/L.

   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the city in
the following manner:
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent, and a penalty of 10% of the rates or charges shall
attach thereupon thereto. The time at which such rates or charges shall be paid
is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing the bill.

   (A)   In the event that two or more business establishments discharging
sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of
water is measured by a single water meter, then in such case, billing shall be
for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that an
additional charge shall be added thereto in the amount as set forth in division
(C) of this section per month for each such business establishment over one
served through the single water meter.
   (B)   In the event two or more dwelling units, such as trailers, apartments
or housekeeping rooms, or duplexes, discharging sanitary sewage, water, or
other liquids into the city’s sanitary system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that an additional charge shall be added
thereto in the amount as set forth in division (C) of this section per month
for each dwelling unit over one served through the single water meter. In the
case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling units shall be interpreted as the
maximum capacity for trailers in the park, plus any other dwelling units served
through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or
other living space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.

an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the City Clerk, and
delivered to the consumer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued.
The consumer shall have an opportunity for a hearing within ten days of such
emergency discontinuance.

contractor, containers shall be of a durable grade of galvanized metal or other
suitable material approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety of not
greater than 32-gallon capacity. They should be provided with two lifting

CHAPTER 54: PUBLIC WORKS FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION POLICIES
Section
   
54.01   Purpose
   
54.02   Policy for the construction of new public works facilities
   
54.03   Procedure
Cross-reference:
   Future drilling of water wells within the city prohibited, see
§ 52.05
§ 54.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the desire of the Common Council and the Board of Public Works
and Safety to establish policies regarding the construction and/or replacement
of public works in the city, including streets, curbs, alleys, walks, street
lights, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, and electrical service; and
it is the purpose of this chapter to set forth these policies.
   (B)   It is the basic position of the city that public works facilities and
improvements, hereinafter defined as streets, curbs, alleys, walks, street
lights, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and water lines and electrical service
shall be constructed for the convenience and benefit of the properties that the
public works facilities serve. The cost of constructing the public works
facilities shall be the primary responsibility of those properties receiving
the benefit from the facilities. These facilities shall be constructed in
accordance to city specifications.
   (C)   It is not the policy of the city to provide these public works
facilities for any property or at any location at no cost to the properties
receiving the benefit from the facilities.
(1980 Code, § 54.01) (Res. 1995-23, passed 8-22-1995)
§ 54.02 POLICY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW PUBLIC WORKS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Streets, curbs and alleys. It is expected that each property owner
and/or property developer receiving the service and use of streets, curbs and
alleys shall pay on a pro rata share cost basis for the initial improvement or
construction of these public works facilities. Once constructed and accepted by
the city, the city shall be responsible for routine and periodic maintenance.
The city will use Motor Vehicle Highway Revenue, Local Road and Street Revenue,
or other funds or taxes for the maintenance and reconstruction of improved
streets, curbs and alleys, as available and allocated in an approved capital
improvements plan.
   (B)   Walks. Construction of sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the
abutting property owner. Furthermore, all property owners must be responsible
for maintenance of the walks. For new land development projects such as new
housing, commercial or industrial subdivisions, the developers shall be
responsible for the cost and installation of sidewalks if required. The city,
in its discretion, may elect to participate in the reconstruction of sidewalks
in residential areas where funds for such purpose are available and such
improvements are deemed by the city to be of benefit to the city in general.
   (C)   Electrical service. It is the responsibility of the Columbia City
Municipal Electric Department to extend and install electric service to new
development sites or new service areas within its jurisdiction. The Electric
Utility Department is responsible for the cost of the installation of this
service to the new development or new service areas and for the maintenance of
these service lines.
   (D)   Street lights. The city will provide street lighting in a standard
street lighting style, as funds may be available and allocated in an approved
capital improvements plan. The city shall provide labor for the installation of
street lighting at no expense to the owner, provided that the owner pays the
cost of the fixtures and poles. These shall be street lights installed on the
city's standard poles with overhead wiring. If any property owner or owners
should desire to have ornamental lighting in lieu of the standard lighting,
they shall petition for such improvement to the Board of Public Works and
Safety, and if such petition is granted, the property owner shall be required
to pay the increased cost of materials.
   (E)   Storm sewers. Storm sewers shall be designed and constructed to serve
the watershed area. The cost of storm sewers shall be prorated over the
benefitted property owners in a manner consistent with Barrett Law or other
assessment procedures provided by state statute to the city. The city may elect
to seek federal and state funding, where possible, to assist in these costs.
For new land development projects, such as new housing, commercial or
industrial subdivisions, the developers shall be responsible for the cost and
installation of storm sewers.
   (F)   Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers will be available to be extended for
the benefit to serve additional properties. The cost shall be prorated to the
benefitted property owners in a manner consistent with the Barrett Law or other
assessment procedures provided by state statute to the city. The city may elect
to seek federal and state funding, where possible, to assist in these costs.
For new land development projects, such as new housing, commercial or
industrial subdivisions, the developers shall be responsible for the cost and
installation of sanitary sewers.
   (G)   Water lines. Water lines shall be available to be extended for the
benefit to serve additional properties. The cost shall be prorated to the
benefitted property owners in a manner consistent with the Barrett Law or other
assessment procedures provided by state statute to the city. The city will also
seek federal and state funding, where possible, to assist in the sharing of
these costs. For new land development projects, such as new housing, commercial
or industrial subdivisions, the developers shall be responsible for the cost
and installation of water lines.
   (H)   Other matters. Where the tangible and intangible benefits to the city
of proposed development, determined in the discretion of the Common Council and
Board of Public Works and Safety, are to be derived from the development, the

improvement desired and its location, and shall be signed by the property
owners making such a request. The procedure outlined in the city's subdivision
control ordinance shall also be followed in the case of new development.
   (B)   Upon receiving the petition, the Board of Public Works and Safety will
review existing facilities in the area and prepare a preliminary cost estimate
for the public facilities requested and make a determination of the available
funds to assist in any cost sharing of these public improvements. Upon
completion of this determination, the Board of Public Works and Safety shall
then inform the petitioner and other affected property owners, who will be
expected to cost-share in the public works aspect of the proposed project and
the Board's finding, including the estimated cost.
   (C)   The Common Council or the Board of Public Works and Safety, after
consultation with the developer and/or property owner, may determine whether or
not to proceed with the project. If the decision is made to proceed with the
project, the terms and conditions of the city's participation shall be set
forth in writing and signed by the appropriate city official and the developer
and/or the affected property owners. The city shall then follow the applicable
state statutes for the construction of public improvements and complete the

representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

§ 55.072 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 55.080 RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any
user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this
chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users
shall allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
   (B)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of, performing specific responsibilities.
   (C)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (D)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated semi-annually to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(1980 Code, § 55.080) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
Penalty, see § 55.999
§ 55.081 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant
from the Circuit Court of the County.
(1980 Code, § 55.081) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.082 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is available to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data,” as defined by 40
C.F.R. 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.

Penalty, see § 55.999
§ 55.083 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);
      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violations which the city determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(1980 Code, § 55.083) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 55.090 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
(1980 Code, § 55.090) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.091 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
§§ 55.093 and
55.094 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(1980 Code, § 55.091) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.092 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show causing hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(1980 Code, § 55.092) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.093 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(1980 Code, § 55.093) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.094 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(1980 Code, § 55.094) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.095 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed the maximum fine
allowed under Indiana law in accordance with I.C. 36-1-3-8(a)(10)(A). A fine of
at least $1,000 per day, per violation, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)
(vi)(A), but no more than $2,500 per day, per violation, for a first violation.
For subsequent violations, the fine may not exceed $7,500 per day, per
violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 90 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 21 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
city may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(1980 Code, § 55.095) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996; Am. Ord. 2008-10,
passed 7-22-2008)
§ 55.096 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
   (B)   The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
55.097 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under
§§ 55.093 or
55.097.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(1980 Code, § 55.096) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
Penalty, see § 55.999
§ 55.097 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions of
§ 55.060, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in
§§ 55.035 et seq.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 55.093 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(1980 Code, § 55.097) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 55.105 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(1980 Code, § 55.105) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.106 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
§ 55.020(A) or the specific prohibitions in
§ 55.020(B)(3) through (10) if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(1980 Code, § 55.106) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.107 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
      (3)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of this
section.
(1980 Code, § 55.107) (Ord. 1996-40, passed 11-12-1996)
§ 55.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Injunctive relief.  When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the city may petition the Circuit Court through the City's
Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalty.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for the
maximum civil penalty allowed under Indiana law but not less than $1,000 per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than maximum fine allowed under
Indiana law per violation.
      (2)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
the maximum fine allowable under state law or be subject to imprisonment for
not more than one year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under Indiana
law.
      (3)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by, a fine of
not more than the maximum fine allowable under Indiana law per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine if not more than the maximum fine allowable under Indiana law per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response
plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 56.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Columbia City through the
regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter

and filling affecting 400 cubic yards or more of soil, sand, gravel, stone, or
other material;
      (4)   Those involving street, highway, road, or bridge construction,
enlargement, relocation, or reconstruction; and
      (5)   Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing, or enlarging of
an underground pipe or utility for a distance of 300 feet or more.
   (B)   Erosion and other sediment control requirements. The following
requirements shall be met on all sites, regardless of size:
      (1)   Site dewatering. Sediment-laden water from dewatering activities
flowing from the site shall be detained by temporary sediment basins or other
appropriate measures. Also, water shall not be discharged in a manner that
causes erosion in the receiving channel.
      (2)   Waste and material disposal. Wastes or unused building materials
including, but not limited to, garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
toxic materials, and hazardous substances, shall not be carried by runoff from
a site. Proper disposal of all wastes and used building materials, in line with
the nature of the waste material, is required.
      (3)   Tracking. Sediment being tracked from a site onto public or private
roadways shall be minimized. This can be accomplished initially by a well-
planned layout of roads, construction entrances, access drives, and parking
areas of sufficient width and length. However, protective covering also may be
necessary.
      (4)   Sediment removal. Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared
of accumulated sediment. If appreciable sedimentation occurs after a storm
event, the sediment shall be deposited on the parcels of land, if in the site,
from where it likely originated so that the erosion and sedimentation does not
recur.
      (5)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
against sedimentation with straw bales, filter fabric, or equivalent barriers
meeting accepted design criteria, standards, and specifications. During winter
months other methods may be incorporated as approved by the city.
      (6)   Site erosion control. The following items apply only to the time
period when land-disturbing activities are taking place:
         (a)   Runoff passing through a site from adjacent area shall be
controlled by diverting it around disturbed areas.
         (b)   Runoff from a disturbed area shall be controlled by one or more
of the following measures:
            1.   Unvegetated areas that are scheduled or likely to be left
inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with
measures appropriate for the season to minimize erosion potential. Alternative
measures to site stabilization are acceptable if the project site owner or
their representative can demonstrate they have implemented erosion and sediment
control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge. Vegetated areas with a
density of less than 70% shall be restabilized using appropriate methods to
minimize the erosion potential.
            2.   With disturbed areas within a site of 10 acres or more, where
drainage is in the same direction or where runoff will result in loss of soil,
an abatement or recovery program is required.
            3.   With disturbed areas within a site of less than 10 acres,
filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent erosion control measures placed along
all sideslope and downslope sides of the site shall be required.
   (C)   Barriers. Erosion from all storage piles shall be controlled by
placing straw bales, filter fence or other appropriate barriers around the
piles. Adjacent storm drain inlets shall be protected using similar filter
barriers.
(Ord. 2004-46, passed 1-11-2005)
§ 56.68 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL LOTS WITHIN A PERMITTED PROJECT.

   (D)   Sediment discharge and tracking from each lot must be minimized
throughout the land disturbing activities on the lot until permanent
stabilization has been achieved.
   (E)   Clean-up of sediment that is either tracked or washed onto roads. Bulk
clearing of sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment must be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in compliance
with all applicable statutes and rules.
   (F)   Adjacent lots disturbed by an individual lot operator must be repaired
and stabilized with temporary or permanent surface stabilization.
   (G)   For individual residential lots, final stabilization will be achieved
when the individual lot operator:
      (1)   Completes final stabilization; or
      (2)   Has installed appropriate erosion and sediment control measures for
an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and has
informed the homeowner of the requirement for, and benefits of, final
stabilization.

§ 56.73 PROJECT TERMINATION.
   An orderly and timely termination of a project with land-disturbing
activities should be planned between all persons involved with a site.
   (A)   Prior to final land grading, seeding, and mulching, the person holding
the permit should petition, in writing, the city to allow the installation of
utility lines on the site. Those persons involved in the installation of
utility lines shall perform their work promptly to minimize the time period
during which some of the land may be left in a relatively unprotected state.
After the utility lines have been installed, the person holding the permit
shall promptly complete all erosion control activities.
   (B)   When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit shall
petition, in writing, the city for approval of erosion control measures which
are to remain on the site to evaluate the adequacy of these control measures.
      (1)   If the erosion control measures are approved, any surety bonds and/
or letters of credit shall be released forthrightly. However, maintenance
responsibilities (see §
56.69) shall remain with the person owning the land.
      (2)   If the erosion control measures are not approved because they are
not in line with either the erosion and sediment control plan or the general
principles of this chapter, the city shall notify, in writing, the person
holding the permit of unacceptable features. After a minimum period of two
weeks during which corrective measures are taken, a petition, again in writing,
may be sent asking the city to evaluate the adequacy of the erosion control
measures. If, in good faith, the city again decides that the erosion control
measures are inadequate, the city may delay the release of any surety bonds
and/or letters of credit for up to two months. After an agreed upon time period
of two months or longer has lapsed without corrective measures being taken, the
city may use the surety bonds to finance changes or additions to the erosion
control measures needed to complete the project.

be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as the “code.”
(1980 Code, § 94.001) (Ord. 2016, passed 1-23-2001)
§ 94.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose and intent of this code is:
   (A)   To prescribe minimum requirements and controls to safeguard life,
property or public welfare from the hazards of fire and explosion arising from
the storage, handling or use of substances, materials or devices, and from
conditions hazardous to life, property or public welfare in the use or
occupancy of buildings, structures, sheds, tents, lots or premises.
   (B)   To prescribe a course of action to be taken to gain compliance with
the state and local codes, ordinances and regulations for fire prevention.
(1980 Code, § 94.002) (Ord. 2016, passed 1-23-2001)
§ 94.003 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The provisions of this code and the fire safety rules of the Indiana

life or property.
      (2)   The transportation of any articles or substances under the
jurisdiction of and in compliance with the regulations prescribed by the armed

abrogate, nullify or abolish any law, ordinance or code adopted by the city
governing the construction, alteration, addition, repair, removal, demolition,
use, location, occupancy and maintenance of buildings specifically provided
herein. When any provision of this code is found to be in conflict with any
building, zoning, safety, health, other applicable law, ordinance or code of
the city or rules of the Fire Prevention Building Safety Commission existing on
the effective date of this code or hereafter adopted, except as provided for by
675 I.A.C. 12, the provision which establishes the higher standard for the
promotion and protection of the safety and welfare of the public shall prevail.
   (C)   The planning, design and construction of new buildings and structures
to provide egress facilities, fire protection, and built-in fire protection
equipment shall be controlled by the building rules of the Indiana Fire

changes in buildings required by the provisions of this code which are within
the scope of the said building rules shall be made in accordance therewith.
   (D)   Buildings built under and in full compliance with the building and
fire safety laws and rules in force at the time of construction or alteration
thereof, and that have been properly maintained and used for such use as
originally permitted, shall be exempt from the requirements of this code
pertaining to any of the following matters:
      (1)   Fire protection of structural elements.
      (2)   Exits required, except as provided for existing buildings under
this code.

however, that the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal shall require the installation of
fire safety devices or systems (fire extinguishers, fire alarms, fire detection
devices, or similar systems) where they are necessary to provide safety to
life. In lieu of requiring the installation of safety devices or systems or
when necessary to secure safety in addition thereto, the Fire Chief or Fire
Marshal shall prescribe limitations on the handling and storage of materials or
substances or upon operations that are liable to cause fire, contribute to the

   (A)   Graffiti. See §
95.008.
   (B)   Inspection of premises. Whenever a complaint is made to the Mayor or
Board of Public Works and Safety (often referred to as the “Board” in this
chapter) that a public nuisance exists or has existed within the city or
whenever a public officer of the city determines that a public nuisance may
exist or has existed within the city, a city official designated by the Mayor
or the Board (often referred to as the “inspection officer”) shall inspect or
cause to be inspected the premises and shall make a written report of his or
her findings to the Mayor. Whenever practicable, the inspection officer shall
cause photographs to be made of the premises and shall file the same in the
office of the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Notice; abatement.
      (1)   Notice to owner - immediate danger. If the inspection officer
determines that a public nuisance exists on private or public property and that
there is a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace,
morals or decency, the Mayor or Board may direct the Chief of Police, or an
officer of the Police Department, to serve a notice on the owner, or, if the
owner cannot be found, on the occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining such nuisance. The Chief of Police may also be directed to post a
sign prominently on said real estate, which sign shall give notice of the
existence of a nuisance on said real estate and request the owner, or anyone
having knowledge of the whereabouts of the owner, to contact the Board. Such
notice shall direct the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining such nuisance to abate or remove such nuisance within 24 hours and
shall state that unless such nuisance is so abated, the city will cause the
same to be abated and will charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant or
person causing, permitting or maintaining the same, as the case may be. The
owner, in such notice, shall be provided an opportunity to be heard before the
Board in the event the owner disputes the determination of the inspection
officer.
      (2)   Notice to owner - no immediate danger. If the inspection officer
determines that a public nuisance exists on private or public property that
does not present an immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace,
morals or decency, the Mayor or Board may direct the Chief of Police, or an
officer of the Police Department, to serve a notice on the owner or direct the
Clerk to serve notice by mail as permitted under I.C. l-l-7-l(b), or, if the
owner cannot be found, on the occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining such nuisance. The Chief of Police may also be directed to post a
sign prominently on said real estate, which sign shall give notice of the
existence of a nuisance on said real estate and request the owner, or anyone
having knowledge of the whereabouts of the owner, to contact the Board. Such
notice shall direct the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining such nuisance to abate or remove such nuisance within a time, not
less than ten days, from receipt of the notice and that, if the owner fails to
do so, the Board shall itself abate the nuisance upon the expiration of the
time period specified in the notice and hold a lien against the real estate for
the costs involved. In establishing the time within which the owner must abate
the nuisance as provided in this section, the Board shall take into
consideration the nature of the nuisance, the ease or difficulty with which
such nuisance may be abated, and the harm, or threatened harm, resulting from
the nuisance. The owner, in such notice, shall be provided an opportunity to be
heard before the Board in the event the owner disputes the determination of the
inspection officer.
      (3)   Abatement by city or by court action. If the nuisance is not abated
within the time provided or if the owner, occupant or person causing the
nuisance cannot be found, the Mayor or Board, or their designee, may cause the
abatement or removal of such public nuisance. In the alternative, if the
inspection officer determines that a public nuisance exists on private premises
but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten great and
immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, such
officer may file a written report of the officer’s findings with the Mayor or
Board, who may determine that an action to abate such nuisance should be
commenced in the name of the city. The city may seek court costs and attorney’s
fees as a result of having to bring such an action.

   In addition to any other penalty imposed by this section for the erection,
contrivance, creation, continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the
cost of abating a public nuisance incurred by the city shall be collected as a
debt from the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the
nuisance, and if notice to abate the nuisance has been given to the owner, such

§ 95.072 NOISES PROHIBITED.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, UNREASONABLE NOISE shall mean sound that
is of a volume, frequency, or pattern that prevents, disrupts, injures, or
endangers the health, safety, welfare, prosperity, comfort or repose of
reasonable persons or ordinary sensitivities within the city, given the time of
day or environment in which the sound is made.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for
any person to cause or make any unreasonable noise or to allow any unreasonable
noise to be made in or on any real or personal property occupied or controlled
by that person.
   (C)   In addition to the foregoing, the following acts are violations of
this section:
      (1)   It shall be a violation of this section to operate a motor vehicle
with an internal combustion, steam or air motor unless the motor vehicle is
equipped with a suitable and efficient muffler or baffle. A muffler or baffle
shall be considered suitable and efficient, for purposes of this section, when
the vehicle does not create unreasonable noise. Except by specific governmental
authorization by the Mayor or his or her duly authorized representative or the
Board of Public Works and Safety (the “Board”), no person while on a public or
private highway, street or road shall operate a motor vehicle with the muffler
or baffle cut out or removed. No cutout shall be so arranged or connected as to
permit its operation or control by the driver of any motor vehicle while in

television, digital media player, loudspeaker, sound amplifier, musical
instrument, or any other machine or device for producing or reproducing sound
at a volume that is louder than necessary for the convenient hearing of persons
who are inside the vehicle within which such device is placed, used or
operated. Sound that is clearly audible 30 feet or more from the vehicle is
prima facie evidence of a violation of this section.
      (4)   It shall be a violation of this section to play, use, operate or
allow to be played, used or operated, any radio television, digital media
player, loudspeaker, sound amplifier, musical instrument, or any other machine
or device for producing or reproducing sound in such a manner that the sound
produced persists continuously or intermittently for a period of at least 15
minutes and can be heard outside the immediate premises from the location of
the emitter by a person with normal hearing. Sound that is clearly audible to a
person with normal hearing from any place other than the premises from which
the source of the sound is located, when the sound occurs between the hours of
9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., is prima facie evidence of a violation of this
section.

identity theft relating to such account;
      (5)   Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the
customer has accessed the customer’s account causing additional charges to
accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or

combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her
discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity
theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red
flags to Clerk-Treasurer. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems
that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to Clerk-
Treasurer, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is
necessary. If Clerk-Treasurer in his or her discretion determines that further
action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 118.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter, along with any amendments that may be made to it, shall be
known as the Columbia City Cable Communications Ordinance, hereinafter referred
to as this chapter.
(1980 Code, § 118.001) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.002 INTENT.
   The Common Council finds that the development of cable communications
systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents
of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated
with cable communications, the Common Council further finds that the public
convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing
regulatory powers vested in the city government. The chapter is intended to
provide for and specify the means to best protect the public interest and
advance public purposes in these matters.
(1980 Code, § 118.002) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.003 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The chapter has been adopted under the Home Rule authority (I.C. 36-1-
3-1 et seq.) granted all Indiana municipalities. The chapter also exercises
specific powers granted local governmental entities by federal law. The primary
applicable federal law is the Communications Act of 1934 and all amendments
adopted thereto. At the time of the initial adoption of this chapter, most of
the applicable federal law provisions come from two amendments to the
Communications Act of 1934, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 ( Pub.
L. No. 98-549) and the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act
of 1992 ( Pub. L. No. 102-385). These federal acts are codified at 47 U.S.C. §§
201 et seq. and. 521 et seq.
   (B)   47 U.S.C. 541(a) provides municipalities the authority to grant one or
more cable communications system franchises within its jurisdiction. Under 47
U.S.C. 541(a) a franchise authorizes the grantee to construct a cable system
over public rights-of-way and through easements within the franchise area which
have been dedicated for compatible uses. 47 U.S.C. § 541(b) provides that a
cable operator may not provide cable services without a franchise.
(1980 Code, § 118.003) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)

(1980 Code, § 118.004) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
SCOPE OF FRANCHISE AUTHORITY
§ 118.015 FRANCHISE REQUIREMENT.
   No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the public
ways of the city, or otherwise be allowed to operate, without a franchise
secured in accordance with the provisions of the chapter.
(1980 Code, § 118.015) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996) Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.016 FRANCHISE DURATION.
   The duration of any franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations, and
restrictions pertaining thereto shall be as established in the franchise
agreement, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions of the chapter
or of the franchise agreement.
(1980 Code, § 118.016) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.017 FUNCTION OF FRANCHISE.
   The Common Council's grant of a franchise to construct, operate, maintain,
and reconstruct, a cable system within the city, or a renewal of an existing
franchise, shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the
services of a cable system as required by the provisions of the chapter and the
franchise agreement.
(1980 Code, § 118.017) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.018 FRANCHISE LIMITATIONS.
   Nothing in the chapter or in any franchise agreement awarded in accordance
herewith shall be construed as an abrogation by the city government of any of
its police powers.
(1980 Code, § 118.018) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.019 FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.
   Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically
reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for cable
systems as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that such additional
franchise grants shall not operate to materially modify, revoke, or terminate
any rights previously granted to any grantee without that prior grantee's
consent, unless the grantor reasonably determines that a modification or
termination of a grantee's right is required by law.
(1980 Code, § 118.019) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.020 SPECIAL FRANCHISE PROVISIONS.
   The Common Council reserves the right to award franchises on terms and
conditions that may deviate from the terms and conditions of the chapter. This
shall be permitted where the Common Council expressly determines that special
circumstances warrant such deviations. A cable operator's use of technology or
equipment affecting the public interest or public resources in substantially
different ways that the chapter was designed to address, may entail such
special circumstances.
(1980 Code, § 118.020) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.021 STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
   Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be consistent with federal
laws and regulations and state laws and regulations. The requirements of state
or federal laws or regulations shall, without exception, control over any
conflicting terms and conditions of the chapter or of a franchise agreement.
(1980 Code, § 118.021) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.022 RELATIONSHIP OF CHAPTER TO FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.
   Except with respect to special franchise provisions established pursuant to
§ 118.020, any franchise granted is hereby made subject to this chapter. Terms
and conditions in the chapter applicable to any particular subject matter do
not preclude additional terms and condition in a franchise agreement on the
same subject, unless those terms or conditions of the franchise agreement would
necessarily conflict with those of the chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to waive the requirements of other chapters or codes of the grantor
regarding permits, fees to be paid out, or the manner of construction.
(1980 Code, § 118.022) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)

based on the review criteria set forth in

and other sources the grantor may deem appropriate. The grantor may grant one
or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise.
(1980 Code, § 118.037) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.038 APPLICATION REVIEW CRITERIA.
   In making a determination whether to award a franchise, the Common Council

applicant is capable;
   (B)   The income and expense to the city government;
   (C)   The needs of other users of the public ways;
   (D)   The capacity of the public ways and private property (including
easements, poles, and conduits) to accommodate the additional equipment or
other demands of an additional cable operator;

obligations under their franchises;
   (F)   The experience, character, background, and financial responsibility of
the applicant;
   (G)   The demonstrated ability of the applicant to meet construction
schedule in the application and any physical requirements imposed by the
chapter;
   (H)   The likelihood that the applicant as a cable operator can maintain
financially feasible operations over an extended period of time.
   (I)   Any other considerations deemed pertinent by the Common Council to its
task of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare, and facilitating
and encouraging the orderly and responsible development of a cable system which
will provide the people of the city with cable service which is versatile,
reliable, and efficient.
(1980 Code, § 118.038) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.039 PROCEDURES FOR PREPARING AGREEMENTS FOR NEW FRANCHISES.
   Once it makes a decision to award a franchise, the Common Council shall
within 60 days provide the successful applicant with written notification of
their decision including a description of the franchise they intend to grant.
This franchise description may incorporate by reference information in the
applicant's franchise application. The applicant and representatives of the
Common Council may then proceed to negotiate a franchise agreement. The Common
Council's decision to award a franchise does not commit the Council to approve
any franchise agreement containing any material terms not identified in its
notification to the applicant.
(1980 Code, § 118.039) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
§ 118.040 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT PREPARATION EXPENSES.
   Once negotiations on a franchise agreement are successfully completed, the
new grantee shall pay to the city government a sum of money sufficient to
reimburse the city government for all its legal, consulting, and other expenses

agreement.
(1980 Code, § 118.040) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF FRANCHISE HOLDERS

amount at all times thereafter, during the operation of the cable system,
unless the Common Council determines that a bond in a lesser amount is
appropriate.
   (C)   Neither the provisions of this section, any bond accepted pursuant
thereto, nor any, damages recovered thereunder shall be construed to excuse
faithful performance by the grantee or to limit the liability of the grantee
under the franchise or for damages, either to the full amount of the
cancellation by the surety during the term of the franchise, whether for
failure to pay a premium or otherwise, without 30 calendar days' advance
written notice mailed by the surety to the City Clerk. The form of the bond and
surety shall be subject to the approval of the Common Council.
(1980 Code, § 118.050) (Ord. 1996-4, passed 4-9-1996)

comply with the provisions of any statute, regulation, or chapter of the United
States, the state, or the city applicable to the grantee in its business.
   (B)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the parties: indemnified and
held harmless herein from participating in the defense of any litigation by
their own counsel as the grantee's sole expense. Such participation shall not
under any circumstances relieve the grantee from its duty of defense against
liability or of paying any judgment entered against such party.

§ 118.051.
   (C)   The form and substance of the policy or policies of insurance shall

grantee's annual gross revenue.

section or the terms of the franchise agreement.

CHAPTER 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 1.01 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as “The Columbia City,
Whitley County, Indiana, Subdivision Ordinance.”
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.01) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.02 POLICY.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to consider the
subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat as
subject to the official Comprehensive Plan and related (such as those embodied
in the City Zoning Ordinance) policies for the orderly and efficient
development of the city.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be
developed without peril to health or peril from flood, fire, or other menace,
and land shall not be subdivided until having access to available existing
public facilities and until improvements and proper provision have been made
for drainage, water, sewerage, other necessary new public improvements such as
schools, parks, recreational facilities, and transportation facilities adequate
for serving the subdivision. Private wells and septic systems in lieu of public
water and sewer facilities are allowable where permitted under the City Zoning
Ordinance and approved by the County Health Department.
   (C)   Both existing and proposed public facilities serving the subdivision
shall be properly related and conform to the official City Comprehensive Land
Use Plan, related policies and implementation programs including the Zoning
Ordinance and Map, the Thoroughfare Plan and Housing and Building Codes.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.02) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.03 PURPOSES OF THESE REGULATIONS.

   (D)   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability and
orderliness of all development through reasonable design standards.
   (E)   To guide public and private policy and action to provide adequate and
efficient public and private facilities, the most aesthetically pleasing and
beneficial interrelationship between land uses, conserve natural resources such
as natural beauty, woodlands, open spaces, and energy both during and after
development.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.03) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.04 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This ordinance is enacted pursuant to Indiana home rule and planning
enabling legislation (I.C. 36-1-3-4 and the 36-7-4-700 series, as amended)
authorizes the City Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove plats
for subdivision throughout the city and its jurisdictional areas, which show
lots, blocks, or sites with or without new streets and highways. This authority
extends to the development or resubdivision of undeveloped portions of already
recorded plats.
   (B)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no construction of any public or private improvements shall
take place or be commenced except in conformity with the regulations contained
herein with construction standards adopted by the city.
   (C)   No plat or replat of land located within the jurisdiction of the
Commission shall be filed with the County Auditor and recorded by the County
Recorder unless it has first been granted secondary approval by the City Plan
Commission, and such approval shall have been signed and certified on the plat
by the President or Vice President and Secretary of the Commission.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.04) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.05 ENACTMENT.
   In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, these subdivision regulations are hereby adopted.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.05) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.06 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT, AND SEPARABILITY.
   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      1.   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provisions of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule of regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
      2.   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement
restriction impose duties or obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in approving a subdivision or enforcing these regulations, such
private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and
determinations made thereunder. [Note: Private provisions can only be enforced
privately unless a public agency has been made party to such agreements.]
   C.   Separability, validity. If any part or provision of these regulations
or application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The city hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any
such part, provision, or application.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.06) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.07 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the city/county under any section or provision existing
at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacation or annulling any
rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the
city/county except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.07) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.08 REPEALER.
   Upon the adoption of this ordinance according to law, the Subdivision
Ordinance of City, adopted, as amended is hereby repealed, except for such
sections expressly retained herein.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.08) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.09 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purposes of providing for the public health, safety, and general
welfare, the city, on recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time
amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. Public hearings
on all proposed amendments shall be held by the Commission and/or the city in
the manner prescribed by law.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.09) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
Statutory reference:
   Local planning and zoning, see I.C. 36-7-4
§ 1.10 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to the city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement, and restrictive use of the land in order to conform to the
physical and economical development of the city/county, and to the safety and
general welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the city/
county at large.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.10) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.11 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   A.   Procedure for resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or that creates a new
building site, it affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption
of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by
the Commission by the same procedure rules, and regulations as for a
subdivision. See also §
4.14(H) Lot Splits.
   B.   Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future openings and extensions of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.11) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.12 VACATION OF PLATS.
   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-3 as amended in 1982, 1983, 1986, and subsequently.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 1.12) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 1.13 VARIANCES.
   A.   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships, or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done the public
interest secured, provided that such variances shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided
the Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other nearby property;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.
      3.   Because of the particular surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of these regulations are carried out;
      4.   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or Official Map as interpreted by the
Commission;
   B.   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   C.   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

      3.   The division of any lot or any parcel of land into a subdivision, as
defined in this ordinance, by the use of metes and bounds description for the
purpose of sale, or transfer, or lease resulting in the creation of one or more
new building sites shall be considered to be subject to all of the appropriate
requirements of this ordinance.
      4.   No improvement location permit or building permit required under the
Uniform Building Code, the Zoning Ordinance, or this ordinance, shall be issued
on any property subject to this ordinance until the provisions of this
ordinance have been complied with.

used, in violation of this chapter of the code, is a common nuisance and the
owner or possessor of the structure, land or premises is liable for maintaining
a common nuisance.
   B.   Violations and penalties. Any person who violates a provision of this
ordinance or any regulations herein contained, shall be subject to a fine of
not less than $100 and not more than $1,000 for each day's violation.
   C.   Restraining provisions.
      1.   Any land within the participating jurisdictions subdivided in
violation of the terms of this ordinance after the effective date hereof, is
hereby declared to be a common nuisance, which may be restrained, enjoined or
abated in any appropriate action or proceeding.
      2.   The Commission may institute an injunction suit requesting an
individual or governmental unit be directed to remove a structure erected in
violation of this ordinance, or to make the same comply with its terms. If the
Commission is successful in its suit, the respondent shall bear the costs of
the action.
      3.   The Commission may institute a suit for mandatory injunction,
requesting an individual or governmental unit be directed, where such
individual or governmental unit has violated any provisions of this ordinance,
to comply with the provisions of this ordinance. If the Commission is
successful in its suit, the respondent shall pay the Commission's reasonable
attorney fees and all costs related to the enforcement of this ordinance.

   D.   Master primary plat. That portion of a Primary Plat submitted in
connection with a multi-phase or phased subdivision application which provides
the information and graphics meeting the requirements of this ordinance for the
purposes of implementing an integrated development scheme for all phases of the
proposed subdivision.
   In all cases the Applicant shall certify the information is an approximation
or accurate (needed for Secondary Approval) presentation. A public hearing
shall be held in the case of a Primary Plat approval meeting of the Plan
Commission; a public hearing is not required for Secondary Plat approval, said
approval can be delegated to the Plan Commission Staff for final approval
subject to compliance with conditions specified by the Plan Commission at the
public hearing on the Primary Plat (Note: For all intents and purposes the
approval of the Primary Plat with conditions is semi-final approval of the
Secondary Plat unless there is a major change in the Primary Plat, said major
change shall necessitate a new public hearing). Plans submitted to the Plan
Commission shall be drawn to a convenient scale of not more than 100 feet to an
inch.

CHAPTER 3: SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURES
§ 3.01 GENERAL.
   A.   Subdivision defined. A subdivision is any land, vacant or improved,
which is divided or proposed to be divided into two or more lots, parcels,
sites, units, plats, condominiums, tracts, or interests for the purpose of
offer, sale, lease, or development, whether immediate or future, either on the
installment plan or upon any other plans, terms, and conditions. Subdivision
includes the division or development of residentially and non-residential zoned
land, whether by deed, metes and bounds description, devise, intestacy, lease,
map, plat, or other recorded instrument. Subdivision includes re-subdivision,
but does not include condominiums regulated by I.C. 32-25-1 et seq.
   B.   Exempt subdivisions. The following divisions of land shall not be
considered subdivisions in the usual sense of the word and are therefore exempt
from the requirements associated with the division of land for residential
purposes.
      1.   The division of land into parcels, or tracts, of five acres or more
in size which do not involve the construction of any new streets or easements
of access;
      2.   The sale or exchange of parcels of land between adjoining or
contiguous land not creating any additional building sites;
      3.   The conveyance of parcels of land, or interests therein, for their
use as right-of-way for railroads or other public utility facilities and do not
involve any new streets or easements of access;
      4.   The division of land for federal, state, or local government to
acquire street right-of-way;
      5.   The conveyance of land for highway roadbed or other public purposes
or grants of conveyance relating to the dedication of land for public use or
instruments relating to the vacation of land impressed with a public use;
      6.   The conveyance of land to correct descriptions in prior conveyances
of land;
      7.   The distribution of land by court order, primarily in the settlement
of an estate but also for any other court action relative to the distribution
of land.
   In all cases, the proper legal descriptions, both superseded and new, and
the legal authorization for the action taken, shall be provided for the
Commission's file.
   C.   Advisory plan considerations. In order to make the most of the
opportunities related to the subdivision and to conserve time, effort, and
expenses, the owner or subdivider should consult with the Commission and other
public or utility officials prior to the preparation of the tentative plan of
the subdivision. The Comprehensive Plan of the city shall be reviewed to
determine how the proposed plan will fit into the Comprehensive Plan
requirements for major and minor streets; school and recreational sites;
shopping centers; community facilities; sanitation facilities; water supply
facilities and adequacy of water source; appropriate drainage systems, and the
relationship to other developments, existing and proposed, in the vicinity, and
downstream from the proposed subdivision.
   The applicant shall be provided with a copy of the Columbia City Subdivision
Checklist of a current date, and as shown in Figure 3-1, and a list of
Checkpoint Agencies in Figure 3-2 to assist the applicant in meeting the
requirements of the Ordinance.
   The Executive Director or staff member of the Planning and Building
Department shall provide the applicant with a schedule of dates for an Advisory
Plan, Primary Plat and Secondary Plat Approval public hearing said dates
reflecting the steps necessary in the quest for a Certificate of Approval for
the plat.
   The Advisory Plan shall be submitted to the Planning Department at least one
week prior to the date of the hearing. The purpose of the advisory hearing is
to provide the applicant with commentary by the Planning Commission relative to
the proposed plan. No official action on the Advisory Plan shall be taken at
this time. The applicant shall submit primary plat and secondary plat petitions
according to the deadline schedule prepared annually for the regularly
scheduled meeting dates of the Plan Commission prior to the regularly scheduled
meeting date of the Planning Commission.

FIGURE 3-2 CHECKPOINT AGENCIES
   D.   Classification of land divisions. It should be noted in discussing the
subdivision of the land that a lot or parcel is “created” on the date of its
recording with the County Recorder and a principle-use building is defined as
that building in which the principle-use of the lot or parcel is conducted.
Standards recognized by the Indiana Administrative Building Council shall be
used to determine whether a given building constitutes one or more buildings in
cases where ambiguities exist. All land to be divided shall be categorized as
follows:
      1.   Major subdivisions. A major subdivision is one which requires new
streets and/or extensions of existing streets and also substantially affects
other local governmental facilities or causes the creation of any public
improvements. Major subdivisions require the preparation of an Advisory Plat, a
Primary Plat, and a Secondary Plat.
      2.   Phased subdivision application. A phased subdivision application is
for subdivision approval submitted pursuant to a Master Primary Plat, or at the
option of the subdivider, pursuant to a specific plan in which the applicant
proposes to immediately subdivide the property but will develop it one or more
individual phase(s) over a period of time. A phased subdivision application may
include an application for approval of, nonresidential development projects,
planned unit developments, mixed-use projects, and residential developments.
      3.   Planned unit development (PUD). A planned unit development is a
development constructed on a tract of minimum size, initially under single
ownership, planned and developed as an integral unit, consisting of a
combination of residential and non-residential use of the land.
      4.   Non-residential subdivision. It is recognized that the subdivider,
in creating a non-residential subdivision, faces problems of lot design not
normally encountered in residential subdivisions. For this reason, the initial
emphasis of the Planning Commission shall be upon street layout and block
arrangement.
         a.   Procedural requirements. The procedural requirements for primary
and secondary approval of non-residential subdivision are as provided in this
ordinance. Nonresidential subdivisions may be either major or minor plats, as
defined. However, in any case, the subdivider need show only the proposed
street and block layout, and not lot locations, on the primary plat.
Subsequently, as prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to
their specifications, the subdivider shall then submit, to the Executive
Director, a secondary plat or plats in phases upon which lot lines are shown.
Streets or other public facilities may not be changed from the approved primary
plat unless approved by the Planning Commission or the Executive Committee.
         b.   Site plan approval. Site plan approval, as required by the Zoning
Ordinance, and the non-residential plat approval may proceed simultaneously
provided all standards of both ordinances are met.
         c.   Non-residential subdivision standards. The standards for non-
residential subdivisions are as follows:
            (1)   Non-residential subdivisions must be appropriately zoned for
business, industry or multi-family (motel/hotel) dwelling prior to the proposal
for a subdivision.
            (2)   All non-residential sub- divisions shall be served by
approved water and sewer facilities, by individual wells, on-site sewage
disposal facilities, or some combination thereof as specified in §§
4.04, Water Services, and 4.06, Sanitary Sewers, of this ordinance. By
reference, Columbia City Code, §
51.05, Sewage Disposal Regulated, and §
51.06, Private Disposal Facilities Permitted, are a part of this ordinance.
            (3)   All applicable design standards of this ordinance shall be
met.
            (4)   All applicable standards of the Zoning Ordinance,
Chapter 10, Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements. Due to the nature of
this subdivision category, which addresses large development of a commercial
and/or industrial nature, buffer zones shall be accordance with §
4.10F. of this ordinance and fire lanes shall be in accordance with §
4.17H.(20) of this ordinance.
         d.   Construction and design requirements. If access will be required
for large trucks and/or heavy loads, the Planning Commission may increase the
design and construction requirements. Section
4.16, Streets: Layout Design, of this ordinance based on the recommendation of
the City Street Superintendent/Engineer. Roads serving primarily non-
residential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended
to the boundary of adjacent tracts used or zoned for residential purposes, nor
shall primarily residential roads be used for access to industrial
subdivisions.
         e.   Multi-family dwellings.  Multi- family (motels, hotels and
apartment complexes) dwellings shall be designed to discourage traffic from
using streets designed and constructed for single-family residential use.
         f.   Buffer areas for non-residential subdivisions. Commercial,
industrial, and multi-family subdivisions shall contain landscaped buffer areas
of at least 20 feet in depth along all lot lines abutting land zoned for
single-family or two-family residential use. The subdivision plans must show
the planting details, including the type(s) and height of vegetation and the
caliper of trees to be planted. Such landscaped buffer shall be at least six
feet in height and shall consist of materials which will form a dense screen,
or an opaque fence shall be constructed to accomplish this purpose. The design
and the materials of such fence shall be shown on the plans.
         g.   Traffic patterns. In non-residential subdivisions, the streets
and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of
buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck
loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between various types of traffic, including pedestrian. A
peripheral street shall be provided when large parking lots have a customer
access street immediately adjacent to the place of business, said street shall
have not less than two traffic islands described in
Chapter 10, Off-Street Parking Requirements, of the Columbia City Zoning
Ordinance.
   E.   Minor subdivision. A minor subdivision does not require new streets
and/or additional local government facilities.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 3.01) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 3.02 SUBDIVISION PETITION REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Application requirements. In order to begin the subdivision process,
the applicant shall file an application for review with the Executive Director.
This application shall:
      1.   Be made on forms available at the office of the Commission and
signed by the owners;
      2.   Include indication of all contiguous holdings of the owner including
land in the same ownership, with an indication of the portion which is proposed
to be subdivided;
      3.   Be presented to the Executive Director;
      4.   Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the plan;
      5.   Include an address and telephone number of an owner or agent who
shall be authorized to receive all notices required by this ordinance.
   B.   Checkpoint submission. In order to fulfill this last application
requirement, a copy of the proposed plan shall be submitted to each of the
appropriate agencies to show the plan location so that their comment may be
made to the Executive Director. The checkpoint agencies appropriate to each
participating jurisdiction in which a plan may be located are listed as Figure
3-2 Checkpoint Agencies; namely by municipal utilities, electric company,
telephone company gas company and cable company. The Executive Director shall
request that all officials and agencies to whom a request for review has been
made, submit a written report within 15 calendar days after receipt of the
request. No response from an agency shall be interpreted as meaning “no
objection.”
   C.   Primary plat hearings.
      1.   Date of hearing; notice. The Planning Commission shall consider the
application for primary plat approval, not later than the second regular
meeting following its proper submission to the Planning Department. The Plan
Commission Staff shall review the primary plat for the subdivision and, when
satisfied that the plans meet all the requirements of the Subdivision
Ordinance, schedule a public hearing of the petition at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. The Plan Commission shall require
the applicant to give written notice to be given to all interested parties,
including all owners of property abutting the proposed subdivision, said notice
to be given at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing, as
specified in I.C. 36-7-4-706. The applicant shall cause the published notice of
the hearing pursuant to I.C. 5-3-1-1 through 5-3-1-9, but in no case shall the
hearing notice be less than ten days prior to the hearing. The cost of
publishing the notice shall be paid by the subdivider.
   A complete set of construction plans shall be presented at the public
hearing for the primary plat.
      2.   Primary approval or denial. At the conclusion of the public hearing
the Commission may give its primary approval, with or without conditions, or
deny the petition for cause. Conditions placed on the primary approval shall be
deemed necessary to the interests and needs of the community. Primary approval
shall be effective for a period of 24 months after the date of primary
approval. Upon request by the applicant, a one year extension of the original
approval period, or a total time period of three years beyond the date of
primary approval; this extension does not require further public notice or
public hearing. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to file for an
extension of the completion date for the petition. If secondary approval has
not been given within this time limit for at least one phase of the primary
plat, the plat must again be submitted to the Commission for primary approval.
Within five working days following the public hearing, one copy of the primary
plat shall be returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional
approval, or disapproval, and the reasons therefore, accompanying the plat.
   D.   Action after hearing.
      1.   If, after the hearing, the Commission determines that the
application and plat comply with the standards of this chapter, the Commission
shall make written findings and a decision granting primary approval to the
plat. These findings shall be signed by the President, or authorized officer of
the Plan Commission.
      2.   If, after hearing, the Commission disapproves the plat, it shall
make written findings that set forth its reasons and a decision denying primary
approval, and shall provide the applicant with a copy. These findings shall be
signed by the President, or authorized officer of the Plan Commission.
      3.   The primary approval or disapproval of a plat by the Plan Commission
or the imposition of a condition on primary approval is a final decision of the
Plan Commission which may be reviewed by certiorari procedure the same as that
provided for the appeal of a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   E.   Field trip. The Commission may elect to take an informal field trip to
the site of the subdivision if the majority of the members present feel the
need for visual clarification of the plans presented. The applicant or his or
her representative shall accompany the Commission to the site. Questions
directed to the applicant may be asked by Commission members. No discussion
shall take place between Commission members regarding the merits of the
subdivision.
   If a field trip is considered necessary, the public hearing shall be
continued until the next regularly scheduled meeting. The petition hearing does
not have to be re-advertised as the action taken at this time is a matter of
record.

   A.   City water supply. The city may provide water mains to and into the
subdivision. Cost of such infrastructure shall be borne by the developer.
   B.   Community water service. The subdivider may provide a complete water
supply system, independent of the city water system when the connection to the
city water system is determined as impractical. Cost of such infrastructure
shall be borne by the developer and shall be constructed in accordance with the
minimum requirements of the Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety and
the Indiana State Board of Health.
   C.   Individual water services. The subdivider shall provide each lot with
an individual water supply source in accordance with the minimum requirements
of the City and County Health Departments.
   D.   Plans for water service. The plans for any water supply infrastructure
shall be prepared by the subdivider's licensed engineer and approved by the
Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety and the Indiana State Board of
Health.
   E.   Recording of water supply installation. On completion of the water
supply installation, two sets of the plans, as built, shall be filed with the
Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety.
   F.   Completion of water supply system.  Installation of the water supply
system shall be completed prior to the construction of any building on the lot.
   G.   Fire hydrants. In any subdivision served by the city water main system,

defined by the Zoning Ordinance (See Paragraph B that follows), to accommodate
the permitted uses) of the property and, if required, an individual sub-surface
flood water disposal system. In general, lots consisting of land located in a
flood hazard area shall not be approved for subdivisions. Consideration may be
given to the possibility that there may be land outside the flood hazard area
available from the parent tract to provide building sites.
   A.   Minimum flood damage. Base flood elevations and their delineation shall
be required for all subdivisions containing flood plains.
   B.   Seasonal water tables. When designing lot layout for a specific area,

of Public Works and Safety. Service laterals shall be installed between the
street sewer main and the property line before the street is paved.
   B.   Privately owned sewage treatment system.  Where it is not possible to
connect the subdivision sanitary sewer system to a city sewer, the subdivider
may construct a local treatment system consisting of the necessary house
laterals, service mains, lift stations, and interceptors required to conduct
the subdivision's sanitary sewage to a single treatment facility.
   C.   Individual lot sewage disposal system.  Where alternatives A. and B.
above are not practical, the Commission may permit the owner/subdivider to
install on each lot of the subdivision an individual sewage system consisting
of a septic tank, tile, absorption fields and associated plumbing.
   The individual disposal system shall not be permitted where soil conditions
exist which would prevent percolation of effluent and/or subject groundwater to
contamination.
   The minimum area required for an individual sewage disposal system shall be
one acre or more in order to accommodate an alternative filter field should the
primary filter field become inoperable. Refer also to §
4.03A., Steep Slope, of this ordinance for further information relative to this
type of sewage disposal system. Refer also to Whitley County Ordinance 0-93-08
“An Ordinance Regulating Private Sewage Disposal Systems in Whitley County,
Indiana” recorded in 1993 under number 93-5-244.
   The owner of the lot having a reserved space for a filter field shall inform
the buyer of such reserved land, and that the integrity of that reserved land
shall not be diminished by the use of that land for other than the stated
purpose designated unless the property owner acquires access to a city or
community sanitary sewer system. This information shall be written and form a
part of any legal transaction with regards to the land.
   D.   Approving authority for sanitary sewers. The Board of Public Works and
Safety and the Whitley County Health Department and/or the Whitley County
Health Officer are the approval authority for determination of minimum
requirements for the establishment and construction of facilities for the
disposal of sewage in a sanitary manner. Upon completion of the sanitary sewer
installation, two copies of the plans for such system, as built, shall be filed
with the City Engineer or appropriate authority. All sources of approval
including approval by the Indiana State Board of Health shall be verified in
writing.
   All aspects of proper sewage disposal are under the Indiana Department of
Health and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   E.   Associated regulations for sanitary sewers.  Columbia City Regulation §
51.05, Sewage Disposal Regulated, and §
51.06, Private Disposal Facilities Permitted, as amended, and by reference, are
a part of this ordinance. Reference is also made to Indiana State Department of
Health Rule 410 I.A.C. 6-8.1 Residential Sewage Disposal Systems.
   F.   Preparation of sanitary sewer plans. The plans for sanitary sewer
facilities shall be provided by the owner/developer and approved by the
appropriate state agency who shall verify that the plans conform to the
appropriate state, county and local specifications. Two copies of the as-built
plans shall be provided by the owner/developer and filed with the Board of
Public Works and Safety.
   G.   Location and size for a residential sewer.
      1.   The residential septic system shall be located at least 50 feet from
any water supply well or subsurface pump suction line.
      2.   In no case shall sewers be located closer than ten feet to drilled
and driven water supply wells or subsurface pump suction lines.
      3.   Water lines and sewers shall not be laid in the same trench. A
horizontal separation of ten feet shall be maintained between water lines and
sewers. Where crossings are necessary, a minimum of 18 inches vertical
clearance must be maintained.

§ 4.07 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   Existing features which would add value to the type of intended development
to the community as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, falls, beaches,
historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the
overall design of the subdivision. Ecological considerations for the
subdivision in development are discussed in the following paragraphs.
   A.   Soil preservation and final grading. A certificate of occupancy shall
not be issued until final grading has been completed, in accordance with the
approved construction plan. There shall be an amount of viable top soil for
landscaping requirements. Planting shall be viable for at least two growing
seasons under normal growing conditions. Top soil shall be stabilized by
seeding, plantings, or similar methods.
   B.   Lot grade and drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide
positive drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage patterns for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the initial responsibility
of the owner/developer having overall responsibility for the development of the
lot(s) to meet these requirements. Subsequent responsibility lies with the lot
owner. The Executive Director or Building Inspector or approved authority shall
give a visual inspection of the site prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
   C.   Delayed initial lawn care. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued
until re-spreading of soil and seeding of the lawn have been completed;
however, if the final grading and/or seeding of the lawn is not done during the
planting season, a letter of intent shall be written to the Executive Director
with the signatures of the builder and the owner, stating that the task shall
be done during the immediately following planting season.
   D.   Existing flora. The subdivider shall strive toward protecting and
retaining all existing healthy trees of 12-inch caliber or larger, measured
four feet above the ground, not actually growing in public roadways, drainage
easements, soil absorption and waste disposal filter fields, paths, trails, or
easements and building sites. Reference is made to the United States Department
of Agriculture publication “Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 255
Protection of Trees Against Damage From Construction Work,” United States
Government Printing Office, 1964, as amended. Two copies of this document are
incorporated by reference into this ordinance and may be on file in the office
of the County Soil and Water Conservation District Office for public
inspection. Reference is also made to Columbia City Code Chapter 99, Tree Plan,
Ordinance 1995-1 and subsequent amendments which shall be the primary source of
information relative to trees, e.g. species, planting, care. Literature is
available in Chapter 99: Tree Plan can be viewed in the office of the Columbia
City Clerk Treasurer. Certain sections of the Columbia City Zoning Ordinance
are made, by reference, a part of this ordinance and shall be adapted to meet
the needs of the subdivision. Those sections or paragraphs are as follows:
      1.   
9.03 Development Plan.
      2.   
9.03(A)(6) Existing Conditions.

   E.   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, rocks, stones, junk,
rubbish, or other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any land, or
left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within a
subdivision, nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision
at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public
improvements, whichever is sooner.
   F.   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards
established by the City/County Engineer or authorized person, and shall be
noted as to height and material on the final plat. No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued until said fence improvements have been duly installed.
   G.   Water bodies and water courses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be drawn as to distribute the
entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Commission may approve an alternative allocation of interests whereby the
ownership of and the responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is
so placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. Where a
water course separates the buildable area of a lot from the street/road to
which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or
other structure, of design approved by the City/County Engineer, or authorized
person.
   H.   Performance bond to include lot improvements. The performance bond
shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained
in this section of these regulations including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, lot drainage, initial lot grading and lawn-grass seeding, removal
of debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the
Commission. Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the
expiration of the performance bond, the city/county may enforce the provisions
of the bond where compliance with the provisions of this section or any other
applicable law, ordinance, or regulation has not occurred. When the lot is sold
to the builder/owner, responsibility for finished grading and lawn-grass
seeding shall be with the builder/owner.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.07) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.08 STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   A.   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not provide adequate provision for storm or
flood water run-off channels, basins, or improved water drainage systems. The
storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary
sewer system. A drainage report shall be provided by the owner/developer.
   B.   Drainage report. The drainage report shall identify the applicable
areas of concern and problem areas as listed on the selection matrix contained
in the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas, October, 1992,
as amended, hereinafter referred to as the Erosion Control Handbook. Said
reference document can be found at Agricultural Soil Conservation and
Stabilization (A.S.C.S.) office and the Whitley County Planning Department.
      1.   Accommodation of upstream drainage area. A culvert or other drainage
facility shall be large enough to accommodate current or existing runoff from
the subdivision's entire drainage area, and existing runoff from outside the
subdivision. The County Drainage Board or other approved authority shall
determine the necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of the
required construction standards and specifications assuming conditions of
watershed development permitted by the Columbia City Zoning Ordinance, Chapter
8, “The Flood Hazard Overlay District,” and discussed in H-89-2 Model County
Subdivision Regulations, T. W. Patterson, Page 49, Paragraph 4.4 (2)(c).
Conditions of the watershed which may affect run-off are subsoil type, positive
drainage channels, obstructions, and so forth.
      2.   Description of minor and major drainage systems. The minor system
will usually consist of, but not be limited to, storm sewers, drainage ditches,
drainage swales, storm inlets or infiltration structures. The minor system
shall be designed to handle a 10-year storm. The major system will usually
consist of, but is not limited to, roadways, culverts, bridges, and overflow
drainage ways. The major system shall be designed to handle a 100-year storm.
In the report quantities of water flow shall be noted at each pickup point or
culvert. (Reference: Columbia City Zoning Ordinance, 1995,
Chapter 8.)
      3.   The location of existing sub-surface drainage tiles. When developing
land for subdivision use, it shall be stated by the owner/developer that
existing drainage tiles are viable or non-viable. If they are viable, they may
be retained. If they are not viable, they shall be sealed and abandoned or
removed. The status of the tiles shall be made a matter of record in the plat
file.
      4.   Lagoons, stormwater ponds, infiltration facilities. Proposals for
the inclusion of lagoons, stormwater ponds, or infiltration facilities shall be
prepared by a registered professional engineer and shall include data
coordinating field tests with design assumptions and estimates of expected
annual maintenance costs, if required by the Columbia City Board of Public
Works and Safety.
   C.   Erosion control. Any disturbed or graded area shall be protected from
erosion in accordance with the Erosion Control Handbook. This may include de-
silting or sediment basins, temporary seeding, mulching, and any other
provision necessary to effectively accommodate the increased run-off caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Areas of
concern as listed on the selection matrix contained in the Erosion Control
Handbook shall be addressed and control strategies detailed for providing
erosion control. Methods selected to control erosion shall be consistent with
the Handbook.
   D.   Retention ponds. The Commission may require retention ponds to regulate
the flow of the outfall of storm water. Such ponds shall be protected from
erosion in accordance with the Erosion Control Handbook. Such ponds shall be
designed and constructed to enable adequate access for maintenance. Retention
ponds shall be provided with adequate safeguards against mishaps.
   E.   Nature of storm water facilities.
      1.   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
prior to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be
located in street/road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the city/county construction standards and specifications.
      2.   Connection to existing systems.  Connection to a state drainage
system is allowed only with written approval from the Indiana Department of
Transportation. Connections to a county legal drain is allowed only with
written approval in accordance with the Indiana Code requirements for legal
drains. Connection to a county road ditch is allowed only with written approval
of the County Engineer. Connection with city facilities shall require written
approval of the Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety.
      3.   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         a.   When a public storm sewer is accessible, and has the capacity,
the applicant shall access the storm water facilities, or if no outlets are
adjacent, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water,
subject to the approval of the City/County Engineer or appropriate authority.
However, in subdivisions containing lots less than 10,000 square feet in area
and in business and industrial districts, underground storm water sewer systems
shall be constructed throughout the subdivision and be conducted into an
approved outfall. Inspection of the facilities shall be conducted by the City/
County Engineer or appropriate authority.
         b.   Alternative methods of storm drainage may be approved by the
City/County Engineer.
      4.   Effect on downstream drainage areas.  The City/County Engineer or
appropriate authority shall determine the effect of each proposed subdivision
on existing facilities outside the area of the subdivision. County drainage
studies, together with such other studies as may be available and appropriate,
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
      Where it is anticipated that the additional flooding, incidental to the
development of the subdivision, will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Commission may withhold secondary approval of the subdivision
until provision (such as a storage facility) has been made by the developer.
      No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage from it will be
provided to an adequate drainage water course or facility as determined by the
City/County Engineer or appropriate authority or an independent, qualified
engineering consultant with the cost to be borne by the owner/developer.
      5.   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the flood plain but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected area of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above ponding levels.
      6.   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized as
having a high seasonal water table as determined by the Whitley County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab-type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      7.   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
flood plain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by
filling or obstruction, except as approved, in writing, by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. No residential building site may be located
within the floodway (See
Chapter 8, “The Flood Hazard Overlay District” of the Zoning Ordinance). (See
Figures
8-1,
8-2.)
      8.   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an
area of the flood plain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may
approve such subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated sufficiently
to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for residential usage have
a flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of, or by, flood water; and, approval to fill the area from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources has been obtained in writing.
      9.   Flood plain areas. When a subdivision within an area of the flood
plain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not been made,
the Commission shall not approve such subdivision unless all streets are raised
sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for
residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of, or by, flood water;
and, filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory
flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream.
All filling in the flood plain must be approved in writing by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
      10.   Recording of plats in the flood plain and floodway fringe. All
final plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that
of the regulatory flood plain shall show and label the regulatory flood
boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final
plat for recording with the County Recorder.
   F.   Natural or constructed drainage watercourse.  When a subdivision is
traversed by a drainage course, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water
drainage right-of-way shall be provided, granted or dedicated to the city/
county conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such
width as will be adequate for the purpose of both drainage and maintenance of
the right-of-way. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be
maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow. The Whitley County Drainage Board by State
Statute requires up to 75 feet on either side of a legal drain. For purposes of
this ordinance, a minimum of ten feet of seeded or otherwise stabilized, land
shall be planted in the area horizontal to the side-slope of the drainage way.
The Drainage Board, which has responsibility for legal drains, shall be
consulted in determining other drainage situations.
   G.   Preservation of low-lying lands. Low-lying lands along watercourses
subject to flooding or overflowing during storm periods, whether or not
included for dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state
as drainage ways, however, any use of these areas shall be governed by the
requirements of
Chapter 8, “The Flood Hazard Overlay District, of the Columbia City Zoning
Ordinance.
   H.   Drainage of lots and blocks. Lots and blocks shall be so graded as to
eliminate depressions that would accumulate storm water. Grades at building
sites shall bear such relationship to roadway and curb grades as to prevent
flooding during heavy storms of basement windows or floor levels in the absence
of basements. Where deemed necessary, the Commission may require the subdivider
to submit working drawings showing contours to which property is to be graded
to provide for the requirements of this paragraph.
   I.   Drainage pipe selection. Pipe used for draining shall be of corrugated
metal, concrete, or PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) of an approved design, size, and
strength to meet the requirements of specific conditions which may be
encountered. Culverts on existing streets shall be enlarged wherever necessary
by reason of diverted or increased concentration of drainage when determined by
the City/County Engineer or appropriate authority. Minimum diameters of pipe to
be used shall be as follows:
Roadway cross drains       12” minimum
Entrance culverts          12” minimum
Perforated under drains       8” minimum
   J.   Storm sewers and the rational method.  Storm sewers shall be designed
by the rational method. The rational method is a means of computing storm
drainage flow rates (Q) by use of the formula Q=CIA, where “C” is a coefficient
describing the physical drainage area; “I” is the rainfall intensity, and “A”
is the area. The rational method is described in Chapter 3 of the “County Storm
Drainage Manual” by Christopher B. Burke, Project for Indiana Counties and
Cities, School of Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, May 1981,
hereinafter referred to as “Drainage Manual.” A copy of the design computation
shall be submitted along with the plans for the storm sewers.
   The storm sewer plan requires the approval of the City/County Engineer or
appropriate authority.
   K.   Street drainage. All streets/roads abutting or included within the
property to be subdivided shall be provided with drainage systems in accordance
with the standards in this ordinance. Prior to the construction of street or
alley surfaces and pavements, adequate drainage facilities shall be designed by
the subdivider, prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved by
the Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety and/or the County Engineer.
A storm drainage analysis based upon a ten-year rainfall shall be used as the
basis for the drainage system. A copy of the analysis shall be submitted to the
Commission and City/County Engineer or appropriate authority along with the
drainage facility plans.
   L.   Shallow swales. Where curbs and gutters are not provided in the street,
shallow swales with low points at least 12 inches below the subgrade of the
pavement may be required by the Commission and/or the Columbia City Board of
Public Works and Safety.
   M.   As-built plans. Upon completion of the storm sewer improvement, a
minimum of two sets of as-built plans and profiles shall be filed with the
Commission, or the appropriate authorities.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.08) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.09 MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   A.   Subdivisions crossing municipal or jurisdictional boundaries. Lots
which straddle municipal or jurisdictional boundaries should be avoided
wherever practical. If a subdivision is located in more than one jurisdiction,
approvals from all plan commissions in affected jurisdictions shall be
required. If access to a subdivision is required across land in another
jurisdiction, the application shall provide evidence that such access is
legally established, and such access shall be permitted only if the City/County
Engineer or appropriate authority finds that the access road is adequately
improved or a performance bond has been duly executed to assure the
construction of the access road.
   B.   Maintenance of improvements. Before approving any subdivision, the
Commission shall review the improvement plans and shall insure that there are
adequate methods to maintain all such improvements. Such improvements include
but are not limited to recreation facilities, common open space, private
pedestrian ways, private sewer and private water systems, and drainage
facilities. Establishment of a lot-owners association with responsibility to
set and collect fees for maintenance of facilities may be required by
“conditions of approval” by the Plan Commission, and acted upon by the
covenants established by the owner/developer.
   C.   Off-site improvements. In reviewing an application for approval of a
subdivision under this section, the Commission shall consider the adequacy of
existing city/county roads and other facilities to serve the proposed
subdivision and may require the subdivider to make and pay for improvements
deemed necessary by the Commission. In no case shall the city/county be
obligated to make improvements for the purpose of making private land suitable
for development.
   D.   Oversized improvements. The Columbia City Board of Public Works and
Safety may require the installation of oversized improvements where it deems
such improvements to be in the best interests of the city/county. In the event
that such improvements are required, the city/county shall be responsible for
the additional cost related to the over-sizing of the required improvements.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.09) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.10 COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND MULTI-FAMILY SUBDIVISIONS.
   A.   General. Any proposed subdivision containing land zoned or otherwise
intended to be used for commercial, industrial, or multi-family uses is subject
to the design standards contained in this section, in addition to those
standards applying to all subdivisions of land.
   B.   Arrangement of lots and/or blocks.  Proposed commercial, industrial,
multi-family parcels shall be laid out in such a manner as to provide safe
access; harmonious arrangements of land uses; separation of different modes of
transportation; areas for drainage runoff and, utilities.
   C.   Street to comply with usage. If access will be required for large
trucks and/or heavy loads, the Commission may increase the construction and
design requirements upon recommendation of the City/County Engineer. Roads
serving primarily non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not
normally be extended to the boundary with adjacent tracts used or zoned for
residential purposes, nor shall primarily residential roads be used for access
to industrial subdivisions. Multi-family dwelling complexes shall be designed
so as to discourage vehicular traffic from using streets designed and
constructed primarily for single-family residential use.
   D.   Large development: commercial, industrial tracts. In large tracts of
land for development of commercial and/or industrial development a street
across the tract shall be indicated for immediate construction or scheduled
construction over a given period of time. When a proposed street is found to be
inappropriate for continuation in light of unforeseen developments, changes may
be made if approved by the Plan Commission. A peripheral street shall be
provided when large parking lots have a customer access street immediately
adjacent to the place of business. Said street shall have no less than two
traffic lanes and shall be appropriately delineated by ornamental islands
described in the off-street parking requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   E.   Alleys/service drives. Alleys may be provided in commercial and
industrial districts unless provision is made for adequate service access.
Alleys may be permitted by the Commission to provide loading and service areas.
Such alleys are recommended to have a right-of-way width of at least 30 feet
and a pavement width of at least 20 feet. Dead-end alleys should be avoided,
but if unavoidable, shall be provided with an adequate turn-around at the
closed end, as approved by the Plan Commission.
   F.   Loading docks and parking. Loading docks, truck parking and/or truck
turn-around areas shall be designated by the use of signed and pavement
markings. These areas shall be separated from parking and access areas used by
automobiles or pedestrian traffic. The intent of this provision is to minimize
truck parking, standing, or backing on public, or private, streets used
primarily to move pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   G.    Fire lanes. Refer to
Chapter 94, Fire Prevention Code of the City of Columbia City.
   H.   Parking lots. Parking lots shall have a hard, dust-free surface and
shall be designed to provide safe, well-defined points of ingress and egress.
The Commission may require such physical barriers, pavement markings, signs,
and landscaping as it deems necessary to properly channel traffic to designated
parking entrances and exits. (See
Chapter 10, “Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements,” Columbia City Zoning
Ordinance.)
   I.   Buffers. Subdivisions containing land zoned for commercial or multi-
family use shall contain landscaped buffer areas at least 20 feet in width
along all lot lines abutting land zoned for single-family or two-family
residential use. Subdivisions containing land zoned for industrial use shall
contain landscaped buffer areas at least 25 feet in width along all lot lines
abutting land used or zoned for residential use. The subdivision plans must
show the planting details, including the type(s) and height of vegetation and
the caliper of trees to be planted. Such landscaped buffer shall be at least
six feet in height, including mounding and landscaping, and shall consist of
materials which will form a dense screen, or an opaque fence shall be
constructed to accomplish this purpose. The design and materials of such fence
shall be shown on the plans.
   J.   Drainage. A drainage plan meeting the requirements contained in
Paragraph
4.08 shall be submitted. Such system shall be designed so as to minimize the
disposal of storm water off-site. Such system shall make maximum use of on-site
retention ponds or detention basins to minimize the downstream impact of the
drainage from the site.
   K.   Water and sewer facilities. Refer to §§
4.04, Water Services, and
4.06, Sanitary Sewers, in this ordinance. By reference, Columbia City Code §
51.05, Sewage Disposal Regulated, and §
51.06, Private Disposal Facilities Permitted, are a part of this ordinance.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.10) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.11 FENCING.
   Each subdivider and/or developer may be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition, defined
as any event involving, or exposing one to risk such as loss or harm, may
exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards established by
the City/County Engineer or appropriate official, and shall be noted as to
height and material. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until said
fence, improvements have been duly installed. If privacy and/or ornamental
fences are part of the subdivision amenities, they shall be no more than 6 to 8
feet in height and architecturally compatible with the type of housing
scheduled for the subdivision. However, no screening type of fencing or hedging
shall exceed 3 feet in height within 15 feet of the public highway nor shall it
encroach into the front yard of a housing unit. Ornamental fencing, plantings,
or rock gardens may be used to define the corners of a lot, however, they shall
not impair visibility at intersections of driveway with the street, and street
with street. No fencing shall be placed upon a utility easement without
appropriate approval.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.11) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.12 LOTS.
   A.   Lot placement. All lots shall abut on a street or cul-de-sac.
Generally, the depth of a residential lot shall not exceed three times the lot
frontage. Some deviation from this provision may be permissible for
topographical and drainage purposes, but not for the purpose of splitting a
large tract into deeper than normal lots so that the provision of streets for
proper access to lots can be avoided. Unusually deep lots, or numerous “pipe
stem lots” (lots having less than 50- foot frontage, except for those 35-foot
frontage on the circumference of the cul-de-sac) shall be discouraged.
   B.   Shape of lot. Lots shall be designed to provide suitable building sites
and related yard areas. Reference is made to Figure 8-1 and 8-2, which
illustrates the manner in which buildable area is defined by the topography of
the adjacent area, namely, a water body. Generally, the depth-to-width ratio of
a lot is 3.0 to 1.0, except when prevailing topographic or other natural
conditions would so reduce the portion of the lot that can be used for a
building site and accessory purposes as to make the lot unusable. The maximum
depth-to-width ratio shall apply to such portion of the lot which is usable for
building purposes. The Commission may deviate from these requirements where it
seems the proposed shape of the lot is more appropriate to the site conditions.
Consideration shall be given not only to topography, but also ponds, wooded
areas, natural features, provisions for open spaces, savings on public
improvements, and the advisability of a Planned Unit Development (P.U.D.).
   C.   Widths and areas of lots. Widths and areas of lots shall not be less
than that provided in the City Zoning Ordinance for single-family dwellings for
the district in which the subdivision is located.
   D.   Lot frontage. Each lot shall have frontage on a dedicated street or
approved access easement. To the fullest extent possible, residential lots
shall front on residential subdivision streets in such a manner as to provide
neighborhood cohesiveness. Along arterial and collector streets, multiple
access points shall be held to a minimum by utilizing common access to cross-
easement driveways serving two or more individual lots.
   E.   Double frontage lots excluding corner lots.  Double frontage lots shall
be avoided. Such lots may be approved by the Commission where it is determined
that such lots are essential to provide separation of residential development
from certain streets such as arterial, collector (feeder), or other similar
uses, and where subdivision lots abut commercial or industrial districts. Such
lots shall be provided with a landscape buffer area ten feet in depth which
will provide a visual screen and prevent vehicular access to one of the two
frontages. Particular care shall be made to landscape the non-access frontage
in a visually pleasing manner, and to ensure that the site triangle
requirements are complied with. (See
Figure 8-3.)
   F.   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger than interior
lots to allow maintenance of setback lines on both streets on which the lot
abuts. Corner lots of residential subdivisions shall not have direct access to
collector or arterial streets/roads.
   G.   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the Zoning Ordinance. The Commission may require that large lots not served
by city utilities, be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the
opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve all such
potential resubdivided lots in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and these
regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule
will give better street or lot plan.
   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial,
or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
   Figures 8-3 and 8-4, illustrate a lot and frontage example to visually
define the types of lots, and a visual representation of yard areas, setbacks,
and right-of-ways, respectively.
   H.   Lot splits. A previously platted lot may be divided as a lot split by
either metes and bound description or by replat. If said lot is to be divided
by metes and bounds description, however, it may be so divided only one time
and by only one new dividing lot line, and shall not again be divided without
replatting. A lot to be divided more than one time or involving more than one
new dividing line shall be considered a replat/subdivision and shall be subject
to all procedures set out in this ordinance. However, lot splits that are
transfers to adjoining property owners not creating a new building site are
exempt from this requirement. (See §
3.01.B.2.)
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.12) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.13 LOT ACCESS TO STREET.
   Access for subdivision lots shall meet the standards of this section.
   A.   General. Generally, one driveway access shall be permitted per lot in
residential subdivisions. Other access arrangements which are allowed, are
discussed in §
4.13B. through H. of this section, and §
4.15, “Streets; Layouts; Design.”
   B.   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or contains
an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Planning Commission may require
that access be limited by one of the following means:
      1.   The subdivision of the lots so that the rear of the lot backs onto
the primary arterial and fronts onto a local street that is parallel to the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along
the rear property line of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, or loop street entered from and designed,
generally, to be at right angles to an access street that is at some distance
from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their terminal
lots backing onto the arterial; and
      3.   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass strip and having
access thereto at widely spaced suitable point.)
   C.   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single-family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided and
lots at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple-family residential area entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and
such entrances shall be widely separated from each other.
   D.   Access to local streets. Generally, single- family residences have only
one driveway providing access to the local street on which it fronts.
   E.   Reserve strips of land. The creation of reserve strips of land shall
not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny
access to the proposed street from adjacent property if such street is a local
service street rather than a collector or arterial street.
   F.   Driveway access to arterials or collectors.  Lots in residential
subdivisions shall not in general have access directly from an arterial or
collector. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed
arterial the Commission may require that access to such streets be limited by
one or more of the following means:
      1.   The subdivision of residential lots so that they back onto the
arterial and front onto a parallel subdivision street; no access shall be
permitted to the collector or arterial from any lots, and screening may be
required in a planting strip inside the rear property line of such lots; (See
Figure 8-3)
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial;
      3.   A marginal access or service road, i.e. a perimeter street,
separated from the arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access
thereto at suitable points, however, marginal access or service roads shall
generally be discouraged in residential subdivisions.
   G.   Minimum external access. Street access for a subdivision shall be
provided to an adequate (as determined by the Commission) abutting pre-existing
street (“perimeter street”) as follows:
      1.   A subdivision with fewer than 40 lots shall have at least one street
access onto an adequate perimeter street.
      2.   A subdivision with 40 lots or more shall have at least two street
accesses onto adequate perimeter streets. The street accesses may be off of
different perimeter streets, or shall be spaced no less than 300 feet from one
another on the same perimeter street.
      3.   A subdivision with 200 lots or more warrants at least three street
accesses onto adequate perimeter streets. The Commission shall require
construction of that third access or an adequate alternate provision, as may be
appropriate to the site.
      4.   Stub streets to adjacent undeveloped property are required but shall
not substitute for perimeter street access unless a variance/waiver is granted
by the Commission.
      5.   External access requirements for multi-family and commercial
developments shall be determined as part of the Development Plan process.
   H.   Minimum internal access. No more than 40 lots shall gain access to a
perimeter street via a single point within a subdivision.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.13) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001; Am. Ord. 2020-31,
passed 11-10-2020)
§ 4.14 BLOCKS.
   A.   Block arrangement. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development permitted.
Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,600 feet nor be less than
400 feet in length. Wherever practical, blocks along arterial and collector
streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length. Irregularly shaped blocks
may be approved by the Commission if it finds that such a pattern is
appropriate to the land to be subdivided and is properly designed.
   B.   Block widths. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers
of lots of appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a
limited access highway or an arterial street, or a railroad right-of-way, or
water course.
   C.   Pedestrianways/crosswalks. In blocks over 1,000 feet in length, the
Commission may require at or near the middle of the block a walk connecting
adjacent streets. Such improvements are discussed in §
4.24, Open Spaces.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.14) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.15 STREETS; LAYOUT; DESIGN.
   A.   General. No land shall be subdivided for residential, commercial, or
industrial uses until adequate access to the land, over streets or
thoroughfares, passable at all times to normal traffic, exists or will be
provided by the subdivider. The land shall not be subdivided if the Commission
finds it is unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, improper drainage,
objectionable earth and rock formations, topography, or other features deemed
harmful to the health, and safety of future residents or uses and the community
as a whole.
   The arrangement and character of all streets and alleys (where permitted)
shall be laid out to best serve the public interest of efficiency, safety, and
economy. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary line(s) of the
tract if deemed appropriate by the Commission.
   Where streets (and alleys) cross other streets (and alleys) they should
intersect at right-angles to each other. The subdivider, or the Commission, may
require that the subdivision have more than one point of ingress/egress in the
interest of safety and/or convenience.
   In residential subdivisions the “gridiron” pattern of street layout should
be avoided with preference given to unique design. The overall arrangement of
streets shall be compatible with the official Thoroughfare Plan of the city/
county and their respective Comprehensive Plans. Residential streets and
commercial streets are discussed in the following paragraphs.
      1.   Residential streets detail cross-section.  Collector and local
streets are appropriate for residential areas. Arterial streets are
inappropriate as they are primarily designed to provide a means of traffic flow
between communities. Figures 8-7 and 8-19 illustrate the cross-sections of
concrete streets with curb and gutter, green space and sidewalks. The
mathematical figures shown on the illustration reflect the measurements
required however, the sidewalk has a four-foot minimum width, the green spaces
may vary; the curb and gutter type may vary due to configuration; the traveled
portion (pavement not curb) between opposing curbing and guttering may vary
depending on whether it is a collector or local street; right-of-ways may vary.
Reference is made to city minimum design standards §
4.16 A. through
4.16 N. for additional requirements. Slope measurements, concrete psi (pounds
per square inch), construction joint and expansion joint specifications and
concrete classification are as indicated.
      2.   Commercial streets detail cross-section.  The cross-section of a
commercial street varies frown a residential street in that the sidewalks are
immediately adjacent to the curb and gutter of the street as shown in Figure 8-
6, Commercial Detail Concrete Pavement Cross-Section with Curb. The figures
shown on the illustration do not reflect the measurements required. Reference
is made to Columbia City minimum design standards shown in §
4.16 paragraphs A. through N. for the actual measurements required. Slope
measurements, concrete psi, construction joint and expansion joint
specifications remain as indicated.
      3.   Pedestrian, bicyclist, handicap amenities. Crosswalks/
pedestrianways/bicycle paths, shall be placed at street intersections and when
desirable, at mid-block. They shall have a minimum width of six feet. A warning
sign shall be posted. A pedestrian operated signal light is required at such
places when a state highway is affected. Consideration should be given for
warning devices at other locations.
      4.   Passenger loading zones. Information relative to passenger loading
and unloading areas are discussed in Figure 8-13, Passenger Loading Zones
Instructions, and Figure 8-14, Passenger Loading Zone Illustrations. Handicap
and bicycle ramps are also discussed under the heading, Passenger Loading
Zones.
      5.   Delegation of responsibility for streets and sidewalks. The Columbia
City Street Superintendent, or authorized person, is responsible for
construction supervision of streets and sidewalks.
   B.   Governing specifications for streets and associated structures.
Governing specifications for streets and associated improvements shall be used
in constructing them. Improvements shall be constructed in accordance with
Columbia City street design requirements as detailed in subparagraphs
4.16B.1. through 9.
      1.   Streets, and alleys where provided, shall be completed to the
specifications shown on plans, profiles, and cross-sections, provided by the
subdivider and prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved by
the Commission.
      2.   The streets shall be graded, surfaced, and improved to the
dimensions required by such plans, profiles, and cross sections using the
material types referenced in §
4.16, Columbia City Street and Associated Structures Minimum Design Standards.
Work performed shall be in conformance with the plans approved with the
subdivision plat, and approved by the Columbia City Board of Public Works and
Safety.
      3.   The street or alley shall not be surfaced until the subgrade has
been adequately constructed in the manner prescribed and approved by the
Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety.
      4.   Prior to placing the street or alley surfaces, adequate subsurface
drainage for the street shall be provided by the subdivider.
      5.   Where curbs and gutters are not required, berms shall be provided of
stone, asphalt emulsion, or other material approved by the Columbia City Board
of Public Works and Safety.
      6.   If concrete pavement is used, contraction joints must be placed
every 20 feet, as well as at every catch basin and manhole, and must extend
through any curbing to the full width of the street.
      7.   Minimum and maximum specifications for street design and associated
structure designs for Columbia City are provided in Paragraph
4.16 of this ordinance.
      8.   Materials specifications for streets and associated structures, as
they apply to Columbia City, are provided in Paragraph
4.16 of this ordinance.
      9.   Streets and roads outside the corporate limits of the city, but
within its jurisdictional area, shall be in accordance with the Whitley County
Ordinance 0-92-11 dated December 21, 1992, entitled “General and Detailed
Specifications for Roads and Streets, Sidewalks, Curbs, Gutters, Drainage
Structures, and Other Miscellaneous Items,” and amendments thereto as they
relate to streets/roads.
   C.   Street plan. All construction of streets shall be in compliance with
the approved engineering plans submitted by the developer. If the project is
developed in phases, the development plan for each phase shall be started
within two years of secondary approval of a particular phase. If the work has
not been started within the two year period specified, it shall be subject to
review by the Plan Commission and accomplished in accordance with the current
city specifications. Completion of any phase shall be within one year following
the initial two-year period allowed for that particular phase.
   D.   Dedication of street right-of-way by plat.  Dedication of street right-
of-way by plat shall conform to the City/County Subdivision Control Ordinance
and any applicable amendments thereto.
   E.   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid
out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing
half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street
shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required street right-of-way width within its own subdivision
boundaries.
   F.   Widening and realignment of existing streets/roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the Master Plan, Official Map, or
zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant
shall be required to improve and dedicate at its expense those areas for
widening or realignment of those roads. Frontage roads and streets as described
above shall be improved and dedicated by these subdivision regulations when the
applicant's development activities contribute to the need for the road
expansion. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying
yard or area requirements of the City Zoning Ordinance whether the land is to
be dedicated to the municipality in fee simple or as an easement.
   G.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by,
and subject to approval by the Plan Commission, shall be constructed at the
full expense of the applicant without reimbursement from the city.
   H.   Street and alley location and arrangement.
      1.   Arterial and collector streets. An arterial street (or road) is
designed to handle large volumes of traffic movement. Certain arterial streets
may be classed as limited access highways to which entrances and exits are
provided only at controlled intersections and access is denied to abutting
properties. Such a street may also be referred to as a major street when the
rules of access are less stringent.
      A collector street/road is designed to handle large volumes of traffic
thereby facilitating the collection of traffic from residential streets or
other streets of a more local community and to provide circulation within
neighborhood areas and convenient ways for traffic to reach arterial streets.
      Collector streets, intersecting with arterial streets, shall have a right
turning lane. The width of the turning lane shall equal the width of one lane
of a collector street. Lot frontage on a collector street shall be discouraged
in residential areas and curb cuts held to a minimum in commercial areas.
Ingress and egress traffic lanes, separated by a median strip may be used
provided the pavement width of each lane is in conformance with standards for
abutting traffic lanes of the collector street.
      Arterial and collector (or feeder) streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as business districts, industrial districts,
schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities, and to the
pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
      2.   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on, or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that the access to it be limited by one of the following means:
         a.   The subdivision of the lots so that the lot backs onto the
primary arterial and fronts onto a parallel local street. No access shall be
provided from the primary arterial. Screening shall be provided in a ten-foot
strip of land along the rear property line (next to the primary arterial right-
of-way line) of such lots;
         b.   A series of cul-de-sacs, of loop streets, entered from, and
generally designed to be at right-angles to an access street that is some
distance from and parallel to the arterial street, with rear lot lines backing
onto the arterial;
         c.   A marginal access or service road having access thereto at widely
spaced suitable points of entry/exit. The service road shall be separated from
the primary arterial by landscaped screening flora or by a decorative fenced
grassed strip.
         d.   The Commission may require that driveways be designed and
arranged so as to avoid the necessity for vehicles to back into traffic on
arterial or collector streets.
      3.   Local and residential streets. Local and residential streets shall
be laid out so as to discourage through traffic in residential areas; and in
such a manner as to permit efficient drainage systems. Excessive traffic
generators shall not be permitted on minor or local streets.
      4.   Existing or proposed stub-streets. A new subdivision abutting an
existing subdivision which has made provision for future traffic circulation by
means of one or more stub- streets shall connect with said stub-street(s) in a
manner complimentary to the existing stub- street(s). The purpose of a stub-
street is to provide for continuation of an existing street or the beginning of
a street when future development takes place. Stub streets to undeveloped
adjacent land are required, the number and location of which shall be
determined by the Director of Community Development and the Executive Director.
Regard shall be given to the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan and the
Thoroughfare Plan. A stub street shall be only one block long and should it
need to be abandoned, it shall be vacated by appropriate government body.
      5.   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs are permanent dead-end streets which are
provided with a circular turn-around at the closed end for the convenient
reversal of traffic in a safe and convenient manner. Lots facing onto the
circular portion of the turn-around shall not have a frontage less than 35
feet. Lot frontages along the straight portion of the cul-de-sac are
constrained by the length of the straight portion of the street leading to the
turn-around. The total length of the cul-de-sac shall not exceed 600 feet as
measured from the centerline of the street from which the cul-de-sac emerges to
the imaginary line of the circle which forms the turn-around, therefore, the
addition of the diameter of the circle, namely, 120 feet, provides the
developer with a total street length of 720 feet. The outside radius of the
turn-around at the closed end shall be 60 feet, (the source of the 120 feet
previously stated), and an inside radius of not less than 45 feet. See
Figure 8-7, Cul-de-sac Turn-Around Plus Distance to Intersection with Street
Centerline.
      The maximum grade of the turn-around portion of the cul-de-sac shall be
5%. Termination of the cul-de-sac shall not be nearer than five feet from the
rear property line. Cul-de-sacs longer than 720 feet, may be granted as a
variance at the time of subdivision primary approval.
      Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be 80 feet in diameter, and constructed of
#73 stone capable of supporting one fire truck.
      6.   Street intersections.
         a.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect, as nearly as
possible, at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right
angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets can intersect
at any one point unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
         b.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practical, coincide with any existing intersections on the
immediately opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets
of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, unless approved by the Plan
Commission, and except where the intersected street has separated, dual drives
without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect major
streets, their alignment shall be continuous without jogs. Intersection of
major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart. The minimum distance between
the centerline of parallel or approximately parallel streets intersecting a
cross-street from opposite directions shall be 250 feet unless it is an in-
line, cross-street intersection.
         c.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving
a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement. Property line corners shall be rounded by a 15-foot arc radius. The
sight triangle of §
10.03C. of
Chapter 10, City Zoning Ordinance, shall be required.
         d.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% rate at a distance
of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
         e.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developers shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
         f.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% or less.
         g.   At alley intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by
an arc at least ten feet in radius.
         h.   No driveway shall be closer than 50 feet from the intersecting
street right-of-way lines, except in the jurisdictional area where the
requirement is 75 feet.
      7.   Right-of-way. When a property to be subdivided is located on an
existing street, the owners of said property shall dedicate any additional
right-of-way necessary to comply with the minimum standards of the Thoroughfare
Plan. Where topography design features, or other conditions necessitate
additional right-of-way or easements to permit construction of a street to the
established standards for such street, the Commission may require dedication of
such right-of-way or establishment of such easements.
      8.    Alleys. The Commission may permit alleys in residential, commercial
and industrial subdivisions, or planned unit development subdivisions, if it
finds that alleys are the best means of serving the subdivision. Such alleys
shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet and a minimum hard surface
width of 12 feet.
      9.   Half-streets. Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted portion
of a street or alley adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the remainder of the
street or alley to the prescribed width shall be platted within the proposed
subdivision.
      10.   Streets near public institutions. Streets leading to schools and
other public meeting places should be straight so as to give a more direct
access from the nearest arterial or major street. When property is located on
an existing street, the owners of said property to be subdivided shall dedicate
any additional right-of-way necessary to comply with the minimum standards of
the Thoroughfare Plans.
      11.   Railroads and limited access highways.  Railroad right-of-ways and
limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
         a.   Buffer strip adjacent to railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway. In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot as required in the district in which
the lot is located shall be provided adjacent to the railroad or limited access
highway right-of-ways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall
be designated on the plat with the wording:
      “This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
other than earth berms, walls, fences, and other landscape screening devices
approved by the Planning Commission, is prohibited.”
         b.   Commercial or industrial sites. In districts zoned for business,
commercial, or industrial approximately parallel to a railroad shall, wherever
practical, be at sufficient distance therefore to ensure depth for commercial
or industrial sites.
         c.   Railroad crossings. Streets parallel to a railroad when
intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent
practicable, be at a distance of at least 50 feet from the railroad right-of-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach grades.
      12.   Street arrangement and topography.  Where appropriate to the
topography, streets shall be arranged so as to provide building sites which are
at, or above, the grades of the streets to the maximum practical extent. Grades
of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography.
      13.   Street trenches. All trenches crossing street right-of-ways shall
first be coordinated with the appropriate authority of the appropriate street
and/or highway department. Such street trenches shall be back-filled and
compacted and further improved to the satisfaction of the appropriate
authorities.
      14.   Business and industrial district streets. In business and
industrial developments, the streets and other access ways shall be planned in
connection with the groupings of buildings; location of railroad or highway
facilities; and the position of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas,
walkways, bikeways and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement
between vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Consideration shall be given to the
provision of a two-lane drive along the periphery of large parking lots. In
large shopping areas, cross-easements and coordinated traffic patterns shall be
encouraged. The use of common double entrances shall be encouraged for smaller
commercial businesses along major or arterial streets.
      15.   Frontage on improved streets. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided has frontage on and access from an existing
street shown on the Official Map, unless such street is:
         a.   An existing state, county, or township highway; or
         b.   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder. Such street or highway must be
suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulations,
specifications, or orders; or be secured by a performance bond required under
these regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these
regulations, or as indicated on the Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever
the area to be subdivided is to use an existing street frontage, such street
shall be suitably improved at the developer's cost.
      16.   State highways. If any subdivision or any lot therein abuts a state
highway, evidence of compliance with all applicable regulations of the Indiana
Department of Transportation shall be required.
      17.   Street names. No street name in a subdivision shall be given the
same name as an existing street in a previously recorded subdivision unless the
new street is a direct continuation of the existing street. No street shall be
named a descriptive term commonly used in civil engineering, e.g. dead-end,
stub, cul-de-sac, etc. Street names shall not closely resemble other street
names unless directly related to them, e.g. South Parkway, North Parkway,
Azalea Court, Adelia Court, etc., in the city or the county.
      18.   Street patterns. Rigid rectangular “gridiron” patterns are,
generally, to be avoided, and the use of casually curvilinear streets, cul-de-
sacs, or loop streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land,
innovative geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where they are
likely to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those persons using
them. An effort shall be made to design the street pattern in such a manner as
to facilitate access to a particular address from the entrance to the
subdivision. In using these street layouts, allowance shall be made for on-
street parking which will not interfere with line-of-sight visibility on
streets having potential for greater traffic due to population density and/or
close proximity to major or minor arterial streets.
      19.   Street and alley widths. Minimum design standards for various
infrastructure such as streets, alleys, etc., are discussed in §§
4.16, Columbia City Street and Associated Structure Minimum Design Standards,
through
4.17, Construction Inspection for City Streets. These data are to be
interpreted as minimum standards; more stringent requirements may be imposed by
the Plan Commission in individual cases.
      20.   Parking. Parking on arterial, collector or local streets shall be
in accordance with the requirements as stated in §
4.16E.13.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.15) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001; Am. Ord. 2020-31,
passed 11-10-2020)
§ 4.16 COLUMBIA CITY STREET AND ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A.   General. The width of a city street shall include the pavement
(traveled portion) of the street plus the width of the curb and gutter on each
side e.g. a local street having a pavement width of 26 feet plus the width of
each curb and gutter as approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety
(B.O.W.) using the type selection from one of those illustrated in Figure 8-8,
Residential Detail No. 1, 18-inch Concrete Curb/Concrete Sidewalk; Figure 8-9,
Residential Sidewalk Detail No. 2, Rolled Curb and Gutter/6-inch x 6-inch
Concrete Curb and Gutter; Figure 8-10 Commercial Detail Curbface and Wingwalk.
The Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety shall also determine the
need and/or placement of improvements shown in Figure 8-11 Paraplegic and
Bicycle Ramp Detail Example; Figure 8-12, General Sidewalk Detail Example;
Figure 8-13, Passenger Loading Zones Instructions; Figure 8-14, Passenger
Loading Zone Illustrations.
   The rural road shall be measured in like manner using the width of the
pavement (traveled portion) of the road plus the width of the berm on each
side. The total measurement would be from the back of the berm on one side to
the back of the berm on the opposite side.
   The subgrade for the curbs and gutters shall be an extension of the
compacted base or grade of the pavement (traveled portion) of the street/road.
   The street grade shall be as follows: arterial–4%; collector–6%; local–8%;
alley–10 %; cul-de-sac–6% (These percentages are from the existing ordinance.
In no case shall the street surface exceed a street grade of three and one-half
inches.)
   B.   Sidewalks and greenspaces.
      1.   Spacing between sidewalk and property line - 1.0
      2.   Sidewalk width: Residential - 4.0; Commercial - 5.0.
      3.   Sidewalk thickness: 4 with wire mesh reinforcement. Thickness varies
with location.
      4.   Sidewalk slope to street 1/4 per foot. Final grade of the sidewalk
is to exceed the grade of the greenspace.

shall be variable.
      12.   Greenspace slope to street: 1/2 per foot.
   C.   Curb and gutter. Construction and configuration details of curbs and
gutters are discussed in §
4.22. Approval of design for them shall be the responsibility of the City Board
of Public Works and Safety, the Superintendent of the City Sewer/Street
Department, or the city designated consulting firm. See Figures
8-8 through
8-10.

      11.   For all low volume streets less traveled and not having curbs and
gutters, three feet of the shoulders shall consist of four inches #73 stone.
      12.   The right-of-way shall be adequate for construction and
maintenance, shoulders, ditches, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, (when required).
      13.   Parking shall be restricted to parallel parking on one side of the
street at discretion of the Board of Public Works and Safety.
      14.   When a street connects one collector street with another collector
street in a high-density subdivision, it may be considered a collector street
rather than a local street and as such, it shall be constructed in accordance
with the requirements of a collector street.
      15.   Cul-de-sac length and other details are to be found in §§
4.15H.5. and
4.16J.
      16.   Pedestrianways/crosswalks/bicycle paths are generally 6 feet in
width with a right-of-way of 12 feet, but the width may be variable as
determined by usage, e.g. greater width to accommodate greater foot and bicycle
traffic or to adjust the width of the sidewalk associated with them.
      17.   Fire lanes shall be 20 feet or more in width. Refer to
Chapter 94, Fire Prevention Code, with particular reference to §
94.040, Fire Lanes Established. Fire lanes shall have curves and corners broad
enough to permit passage by any fire-fighting equipment owned by the City. The
surface of the fire lane shall be an all-weather surface and shall be of
sufficient strength to support all fire-fighting apparatus presently used by
the City Fire Department.
      Fire lanes shall be added, per
Chapter 94, on private property used for assembly, commercial, educational,
industrial, institutional, or multi-family dwelling purposes, and on private
property containing two or more dwellings to which access is provided by
private roads or driveways.
      Subdivision plans shall show compliance with the referenced ordinances
unless there is no location where a fire lane is required under the terms of
the ordinance for fire lanes.
      All plans for fire lanes and fire hydrants shall be referred to the City/
Township Fire Chief for examination. The Fire Chief shall report to the
Planning Commission indicating whether or not the proposal complies with the
City's Fire Prevention Code.
      Fire hydrants shall be located 500 feet from each other. Locations other
than specified, e.g. commercial or industrial complexes, shall be as directed
by the Fire Chief.
      18.   Right turn lanes shall be provided on all collector streets exiting
onto a more heavily traveled street such as an arterial street. Where deemed
advisable for the safe and efficient movement of traffic, they shall be
provided for left turn onto more heavily traveled streets. All turn lanes are
subject to state and federal approval when appropriate.
   F.   Arterial streets/Columbia City. An arterial street interconnects with
expressways providing a continuous high priority network which primarily serves
regional and inter-city traffic. The following data comprise the minimum,

   G.   Collector streets/Columbia City. A collector street provides for the
flow of traffic from neighborhood street systems (minor collectors and local
streets) to the arterial street system, generally accommodating a moderate
service level and traffic volume. The following data comprise the minimum,
unless otherwise stated. For purposes of this ordinance, a collector street
shall be considered an industrial or sub-collector street unless otherwise
determined by the Columbia City Board of Public Works and Safety or the
Superintendent of the City Street Department.
      1.   Construction material for collector streets:
         a.   Rigid concrete–seven-inch 3,500 or 4,000 psi concrete mix; three-
inch #73 stone.

hot asphaltic base; four-inch #73 stone; six-inch #2 stone.
   H.   Local streets/Columbia City. A local street is a residential street
designed to provide access to adjacent property and to conduct traffic from low
volume streets to an activity center or higher classification street. The
following data comprise the minimum, unless otherwise stated. For purposes of
this ordinance, a local street is a low volume street or a local street which
forms a part of a boulevard, unless otherwise determined by the Columbia City
Board of Public Works and Safety, or the Superintendent of the City Street
Department.
      1.   Construction material for local streets:
         a.   Rigid concrete–six-inch 3,500 or 4,000 psi concrete mix; three-
inch #73 stone.

§ 4.20 STREET LIGHTS.
   Street lights are required along all streets in subdivisions within the
corporate limits of the City of Columbia City.
   This requirement shall be construed to permit the installation of street
lights in subdivisions in the city's jurisdictional area. A homeowners
association shall be responsible for the maintenance of the lights until such
time as the subdivision is annexed to the city at which time the responsibility
is transferred to the city.
   Installation of the street lights shall conform to the requirements of the
Board of Public Works and Safety. The subdivider shall provide the street
lights. The city shall install the street lights.

§ 4.21 SIDEWALKS/ PEDESTRIANWAYS/ DRIVEWAY APPROACHES/ PRIVATE STREETS.
   A.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all public
streets.
      1.   Residential sidewalks. Residential sidewalks shall be constructed as
illustration for a concrete sidewalk. A green space may be provided between the
curbing and the front face (side nearest the curb) of the sidewalk and a one
foot or more space which shall be provided between the back of the sidewalk and
the property line as shown in Figure 8-11, General Sidewalk Detail. The minimum
width of residential subdivision sidewalks shall be four feet, one-half inch
deep construction and expansion joints, and wire mesh reinforcement
requirements are indicated in Figure 8-11 General Sidewalk Detail. Concrete
used in the construction of the sidewalks shall be 3500 or 4000 psi mix.
      2.   Commercial district sidewalks. Figure 8-10, Commercial Detail
Curbface Walks and Wingwalk describes the requirements of commercial areas. The
minimum width of sidewalks in a commercial area shall be five feet. Re-rods or
wire mesh shall be used as reinforcement materials. Concrete used in the
construction of the sidewalk and curb shall be 3500 or 4000 psi mix.
      3.   If sidewalks are not provided, the street grade shall be completed
so that additional grading will not be necessary for any future provision of
sidewalks.
   B.   Additional considerations for sidewalks.
      1.   Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of a public, or private,
bridge where a sidewalk or sidewalks exist entering onto the bridge. All new
bridges shall have either one or two sidewalks for the convenience, safety and
welfare of pedestrians.
      2.   Curb ramps shall be provided at all intersections of sidewalks with
the corners of the block, crosswalks, pedestrianways and at other locations
deemed necessary by the Commission. For details of construction refer to Figure
8-12, Typical Curb Ramp Detail, and Figure 8-13, Typical Intersection Curb Ramp
Detail. Detectable warning surface as shown in the figures are required.
Consult with the City Street Superintendent for specific construction details.
      3.   New sidewalks shall be extensions of existing sidewalks when a new
subdivision is adjacent to an existing community which has sidewalks.
      4.   For additional information relative to the care and maintenance of
sidewalks refer to Columbia City Code
Chapter 97, §§
97.10 through
97.28 as amended.
      5.   The Commission may waive the provision for sidewalks for good cause.
   C.   Crosswalks/pedestrianways/bicycle paths shall be placed at street
intersection and, when desirable at mid-block. They shall have a minimum width
of six feet. A warning sign shall be posted. A pedestrian operated signal light
is required at such places when a state highway is affected.
Consideration should be given for warning devices at other potentially
dangerous locations as designated by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   D.   Driveway approach/driveway surface drainage. Driveway construction
regulations shall be as indicated in city ordinance specifications referenced
in §
97.20. Driveways shall be constructed so as not to impede the surface drainage
system.
   E.   Applicability to private streets. The Board of Public Works and Safety
or the County Board of Commissioners recognizes that there are justifiable
reasons for inclusion of privately maintained streets in new subdivisions such
as privacy and security. The Board of Public Works and Safety and the County
Board of Commissioners also recognize that the inclusion of privately
maintained streets in new subdivisions for the purpose of evading the
respective road specifications is not a justifiable reason for such purposes,
therefore all streets proposed to be privately maintained shall be required to
meet the same specifications, requirements and procedures required by this
ordinance for publicly maintained streets during the construction and through
the required maintenance period.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.21) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001; Am. Ord. 2010-13,

shall be required if the subdivision is contiguous with the corporate limits,
or is adjacent to, or between, subdivisions which are provided with curbs and
gutters.
   C.   Lot size considerations. Curbs and gutters are not required if the lots
are greater than 80,000 square feet or 1.837 acres in area, and storm water
drainage is adequately provided for by means of ditches, culverts, as detailed
in §
4.08, Storm Water Drainage.
   D.   Curb and gutter specifications. Plans for the installation of curbs and
gutters shall be approved by the City Engineer or appropriate authority. Said
plans shall be designed by a licensed civil engineer. The curbs and gutters
shall be constructed according to the following specifications:
      1.   The base for the curb and gutter shall be well compacted on the
existing base or grade of the street associated with them and shall be on each
side of the pavement (traveled portion) of the street.
      2.   The minimum specifications shall be as shown in Figures 8-8 through
8-10.
      3.   All concrete used in the curb and gutter shall be either 3,500 or
4,000 psi concrete mix.
      4.   The Planning Commission may waive the provision for curbs and
gutters for good cause.
      The waiver request applies only to minor streets internal to the
subdivision and does not include existing arterial or collector streets or
extensions of the same where curb and gutter exist or have been planned for
installation.
      5.   Plans must be approved by the Columbia City Board of Public Works
and Safety or appropriate authority.
      6.   These guidelines must be met in order to request a waiver, and are
not criteria, which if met, denote automatic approval. Approval of the waiver
shall be considered a completely discretionary decision on the part of the
Commission and shall be noted on the recorded final plat.
      7.   Where curbs and gutters are not required, the subdivider shall
provide one of the types of improvements discussed in §
4.23C.2., and the requirements of Figure 8-5 shall be followed.

   A.   Access easements. The width of an access easement to a lot or tract of
land shall be at least 50 feet.
   B.   Easements for public services. Each lot in a subdivision shall have an
easement(s) for sanitary sewers, storm water sewers, potable water lines,
public utilities such as electrical, gas, telephone, and cable television
(CATV).
      1.   The easement shall be a minimum 20 feet in width with the common lot
line dividing the easement equally between the two properties. Where the
easement merges into the main easement along a street or a non-developed area
the total 20-foot width easement shall be along the lot line adjacent to the
street or non-developed area.
      2.   Easements shall run along the rear lot lines unless approval has
been given for another location.
      3.   Easements shall be aligned to provide a continuous straight strip;
easements in new subdivisions shall align with existing easements.
      4.   Every plat shall contain a statement as follows: “All utility and
drainage easements as dedicated on the face of this plat shall be kept free of
all permanent structures and the removal of any obstructions by a utility
company shall in no way obligate the utility company in damages or to restore
the obstruction to its original form.”
      5.   Under no circumstances shall trees or shrubbery be planted within
the easement area.
      6.   Easements for all utility lines and other facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat and
on the final plat.
      7.   The developer shall provide the buyer of the property with a copy of
the layout of the lot showing and describing the easements.
      8.   When topographical or other conditions are such that the placement
of utilities along the rear lot line are impractical, perpetual unobstructed
easements having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be provided along the side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road and/or rear lot line.
      9.   Any deviations from these requirements shall be with the written
approval of the appropriate authority.
      10.   All utility lines, including but not limited to gas, electric
power, telephone and CATV cables shall be located underground throughout the
subdivision subject to the granting of a waiver by the Plan Commission.
   C.   Storm water drainage, easements.
      1.   The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with an adequate storm
water system whenever curb and gutter are installed and whenever the evidence
available to the Commission indicates that the natural surface drainage is
inadequate. This system must empty either into the city storm sewer system or
into another legal drain. When the surface drainage is adequate, easements for
such surface drainage shall be provided. Deep open ditches for drainage are not
permitted in the street, but where curb and gutter are not provided, a shallow
swale with its low point at least three inches below the elevation of the
subgrade of the pavement may be permitted.
      2.   In a subdivision where curb and gutter are not provided, the
subdivider shall furnish one of the following types of improvements to
facilitate roadside drainage and to assure suitable entrances for private
driveways which are proposed to intersect the roadway:
         a.   A corrugated pipe, at least 12 inches in diameter, and with a
length equal to the width of the driveway, with at least two feet of extension
on each side, with flared end sections to be placed where required.
      3.   For a subdivision within the city corporate limits, the proposed
storm drainage system shall first be approved by the Columbia City Board of
Public Works and Safety, or engineering firm representing the city and shall
meet city standards for subsurface storm water drainage. All engineering costs
shall be borne by the subdivider.
      4.   In no case shall water from the storm sewer system empty into the
sanitary sewer system, nor should sewage from the sanitary sewer system empty
into the storm sewer system.
   D.   Alley easement alternative. Where alleys are not provided in commercial
areas, easements for public services (utilities, etc.) shall be provided. Such
easements shall have minimum widths of 20 feet, and where located along lot
lines one-half of the width shall be taken from each lot. Before determining
the location of such easements, the subdivider shall consult with the
appropriate agency(s).
   E.   Cross-easement agreements. Where adjacent property owners have common
traffic arrangements between adjoining lots, each of the owners shall have
responsibility for reaching an agreement for common usage of the area involved
with maintenance, and general upkeep for that portion of the common use area
serving their respective lots. Where possible, parking areas shall be designed
so as to minimize the requirement for vehicles to back into through traffic
internal to the property or the traffic lanes of collector streets and/or
arterials. A common through-traffic lane(s) along the border of each lot
sharing a common parking area and furthest from the entrance(s) to buildings,
shall be provided.
   F.   Legal drain easements. Maintenance easements along legal drains shall
be provided in consultation with the Drainage Board of Whitley County and in
accordance with the Indiana Code on Legal Drains. Where appropriate, the
Commission shall require maintenance easements not specified by governmental
authority, if deemed appropriate for the specific area. These easements shall
not be less than 75 feet on each side of the legal drain unless waived by the
Whitley County Drainage Board.
   G.   Farm tile easements. Where there are farm tiles which are to remain on
property proposed for subdivision, an easement of at least 20 feet in width
shall be provided for the protection and maintenance of such tiles. The
Commission may require larger easements when it deems such larger easement is
necessary.
   H.   Farm access easements. All parcels, including agricultural property,
shall have legal access meeting the minimum standards of this ordinance. In
addition to the legal access, access easements at least 25 feet in width for
farm machinery and other agricultural purposes, may be provided.
   I.   Construction access easement. While construction is on-going, a
temporary access may be provided for entry on to the property being subdivided.
Environmental debris shall be held to a minimum. At the completion of
construction activity, any temporary access easement shall be eliminated.
   J.   Street tree maintenance easement. The local government has the right to
plant trees within the street right-of-way bordering the lot line of the
property adjacent to the street. Maintenance and removal of the street trees,
if necessary, shall be the responsibility of the local government.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 4.23) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 4.24 OPEN SPACE.
   A.   If a proposed development will include at least 40 units (in one phase
or a combination of phases), the subdivider shall be required to plat a minimum
of one acre of open space for each 40 dwelling units to be constructed when the
gross density of such development is three dwelling units per acre or greater.
A dwelling unit shall be defined as a single-family home, condominium unit,
apartment/rental unit, or villaminium unit, or a duplex rental unit.
   The subdivider shall permanently dedicate the aforementioned open space
acreage for recreational purposes. The land may be deeded by the subdivider to
the city, if accepted by the city and the Park Board, or to a duly organized
homeowners' association within the subdivision. The Plan Commission shall have
final approval as to the use and location of dedicated open space.
   B.   Pedestrianway/crosswalks. Pedestrianways/ crosswalks shall be
considered “open space.” In blocks over 1,000 feet in length, pedestrianways or
crosswalks, such walks shall be required, such walks shall have at least 12
feet width/right-of-way. Said pedestrianways at other appropriate places and at
the end of cul-de-sacs may be required by the Commission when it deems such
ways are desirable so as to provide for pedestrian/bicycle circulation or
access to neighboring uses. Pedestrianway/Crosswalks independent of an existing
street or road shall be constructed as required for a sidewalk. (Refer also to
§
4.21A.)
   In determining whether pedestrianways are required, the Commission shall
consider methods of maintaining such ways and their usefulness in providing
access to any open spaces, water areas, recreation areas, schools, churches,
and other surrounding uses. Pedestrianways shall be perpetual, unobstructed
easements. Maintenance may be assigned to the developer, a home owners'
association or dedicated to the city. The landscaping material depicted upon
the approved plat shall be considered a binding element of the project.
   C.   Natural feature preservation. Existing natural features which add value
to residential development and enhance the attractiveness of the community
shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision and may be incorporated
into dedicated open space.
   D.   Open space layout and landscaping. Easements, crosswalks, and road
frontage to provide public access to the open space shall be shown on the
secondary plat. The landscaping materials depicted upon the approved plat shall
be considered a binding element of the project. Plant material which exhibits
evidence of insect pests, disease, and/or damage shall be removed and replaced
within the next growing season. This maintenance responsibility shall rest with
the developer and subsequent owners for the duration of the subdivision.
   E.   Conservation areas. Land within a proposed subdivision which is located
in a flood plain and/or flood fringe area as described in §
4.08E.8. and 9. of this ordinance may be referred to as Conservation Areas and
considered in the Open Space category; such land may be treated in the manner
described above in division 4.24D.

CHAPTER 5: ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 5.01 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   Before any secondary plat is approved and affixed with the Commission seal,
the subdivider shall construct all streets and other required improvements in
accordance with the approved construction plans, or the subdivider shall
provide a guarantee of performance as specified in this section. The
performance guarantee shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all
public facility and all other requirements contained in this ordinance
including, but not limited to, soil preservation, final grading, lot drainage,
erosion and detention seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing, and all
other lot improvements required by the Commission.
   A.   All performance guarantees must be acceptable to and be approved by the
Board of Public Works and Safety/Board of County Commissioners, and shall be in
such form, sufficiency and manner of execution satisfactory to the City/County
Attorney.
   B.   If the subdivision is in phases, the Board of Public Works and Safety/
Board of County Commissioners may require that the performance guarantee be in
such amount as is necessary for each phase filed for secondary approval and may
defer guarantees for the remaining phases of the plat until they are offered
for approval. However, in the establishment of performance guarantees, overall
subdivision improvements must be considered and any improvements which are
necessary for more than one phase must be constructed or guaranteed at the time
of approval of the first applicable phase.
   C.   In order to obtain secondary approval it is permissible for the
subdivider to construct part of the improvements and guarantee the remaining
part of the improvements, if approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety/
Board of County Commissioners.
   D.   Performance guarantees may consist of any of the following:
      1.   The subdivider may post a performance bond payable to the city/
county in an amount equivalent to 120% of the estimated cost of completion of
all required improvements. Such estimate shall be prepared by the subdivider
and reviewed by the City/County Engineer or appropriate body who shall
recommend the amount of guarantee to the Board of Public Works and Safety/Board
of County Commissioners. Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory
requirements and the Board of Public Works and Safety/Board of County
Commissioners may request information on the bonding company and may deny a
performance bond if necessary.
      2.   The subdivider may submit a certificate of deposit or certified
check made out to the city/county and/or the subdivider, to be held by the City
Clerk-Treasurer/County Auditor, in an amount equivalent to 120% of the
estimated cost of the required improvements. Such estimate shall be prepared by
the City/County Engineer or appropriate body. If the subdivider is named singly
or jointly on such certificate or check, then the subdivider shall endorse it
before submitting it to the city/county so that the city/county may secure the
funds. If other than escrow account is used, the subdivider shall receive any
interest accrued on funds provided under the terms of this section.
      3.   The subdivider may submit irrevocable letters of credit in behalf of
the subdivider and securable by the city/county in an amount equivalent to 120%
of the estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required
improvements. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is utilized it shall
be written for a maximum length of two years and the Executive Director, two
months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall determine if the
public improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the city/county and
if they have not been accepted shall so notify the subdivider of intent to
secure the funds and then commence procedures to secure the funds pledged by
such letter of credit.
      4.   The Board of Public Works and Safety/ Board of County Commissioners
may, at its discretion, accept another financial guarantee which the Board of
Public Works and Safety/Board of County Commissioners deems appropriate to
accomplish the objectives of this ordinance.
   E.   Any performance guarantee submitted under this section shall be for a
period not to exceed two years. The Board of Public Works and Safety/Board of
County Commissioners may grant an extension of up to one year for the
completion of improvements, upon evidence that such extension is justified.
Before granting an extension, the Board of Public Works and Safety/County
Commissioners shall secure a new estimate of the cost of the improvements from
the City/County Engineer, or appropriate body, and if the estimate has
increased, the Board of Public Works and Safety/County Commissioners shall
require an increase in the amount of the guarantee.
   F.   The performance guarantee shall be released or allowed to expire by the
Board of Public Works and Safety/Board of County Commissioners only upon
certification that all required improvements have been installed satisfactorily
by the certifying professional engineer or land surveyor and improvements
accepted. The Board of Public Works and Safety/Board of County Commissioners
may, at its discretion, approve a partial release of the financial guarantee
upon certification that a portion of the improvements has been completed
satisfactorily. The City/County Engineer or appropriate body shall provide an
estimate of the cost of the remaining improvements, and a guarantee sufficient
to cover such cost shall be retained by the city/county.
   G.   For subdivisions for which no performance guarantee has been posted, if
the required improvements are not completed within the period of validity of
the subdivision approval, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In
those cases where a performance guarantee has been posted and the improvements
have not been installed prior to the expiration of the guarantee, the Board of
Public Works and Safety/Board of County Commissioners shall declare the
guarantee to be in default and cause all improvements to be installed according
to the approved plans, regardless of the extent of building development at the
time the guarantee is declared to be in default. The Board of Public Works and
Safety/County Commissioners may grant an extension.
   H.   The subdivider shall build and pay for all costs of any temporary
public improvements required by the Commission and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction of any temporary
public facility of improvement, the subdivider shall file with the Board of
Public Works and Safety a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities,
which bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly
constructed, maintained, and removed.
(1980 Code, Ch. 154, § 5.01) (Ord. 2001-4, passed 3-27-2001)
§ 5.02 INSPECTION.
   All installations and improvements required under the terms of this
ordinance shall be inspected by appropriate city and/or county officials during
and after construction. In no case shall work be commenced without specific
approval to do so from the City/County Engineer or appropriate body. The City/
County shall not be obligated to accept any work which has not been inspected
as required by this section, nor shall it accept any work not completed in
conformance with the approved plans and specifications.
   A.   At least 48 hours before commencing any improvements or installations
shown on the approved plans of a subdivision, the subdivider shall notify the
City/County Engineer, or appropriate body. The City/County Engineer, or
appropriate body, shall inspect all work during and after construction. If the
construction ceases at any time for more than one week, such 48-hour notice
shall again be required before resumption of construction.
   B.   The City/County Engineer or appropriate body shall have authority over
the project as necessary to ensure compliance with the approved plans and
specifications. This authority includes the right to order work to be suspended
for due cause. Due cause includes but is not limited to questionable materials,
questionable methods of construction, noncompliance with the approved plans and
specifications, and adverse weather conditions.
   C.   In the event that work is commenced without the required inspection and
approval, the City/County Engineer, or appropriate body, the Executive
Director, or any other person designated by the Board of Public Works and
Safety may require that work be suspended until such inspection has been made
and approval given.
   D.   Any remedial work determined by the City/County Engineer or appropriate
body to be necessary before the improvements are accepted by the Board of

in the plat must declare the plat or part of the plat to be vacated in a
written instrument, and that instrument must be executed, acknowledged, and
recorded in the same manner as a deed to land.
   A.   Before offering the instrument for recording under this section, an
owner must file a copy of the instrument with the County Auditor and must
submit the instrument vacating the plat for the approval of the Commission
having subdivision control jurisdiction. It must be accompanied by a petition
which:
      1.   States the reasons for and circumstances prompting the request;

Executive Director shall establish the date for a hearing before the
Commission.
      1.   Hearing procedure shall be as established by Commission Rules

      2.   It is in the public interest to vacate all or part of the plat; and
      3.   The value of that part of the land in the plat not owned by the
petitioner will not be diminished by vacation.
   D.   If, after the hearing, the Commission determines that the plat or part
of the plat should be vacated, it shall make written findings and a decision
approving the petition. The Commission may impose reasonable conditions as part
of its approval. The decision must be signed by the Executive Director. The
Commission shall furnish a copy of its decision to the County Recorder for
recording.

vacation, it shall make written findings that set forth its reasons in a
decision denying the petition for vacation and shall provide the petitioner
with a copy. The decision must be signed by the Executive Director.
   F.   The approval, disapproval, or imposition of a condition on the approval
of the vacation of all or part of a plat is a final decision of the Commission.
The petitioner or an aggrieved party may seek review of the decision of the
Commission as provided by I.C. 36-7-4-1016.
   G.   The County Recorder may record the instrument only if a certificate
showing the approval of the vacation by the Commission is attached to it. If
the instrument is not executed and approved as required by this section, it is
void.
   H.   An instrument recorded under this section terminates the effect of the
plat or part of the plat declared to be vacated, and it also terminates all
public rights in the public ways and public places described in the plat or
part of the plat. However, a public way that has been improved, or that is part
of an improved plat, may be vacated only in accordance with §
6.04.
   I.   If any platted land is vacated, the descriptions of the lots and
parcels of that land shall be preserved as set forth in the plat, with the
proportionate parts of vacated streets and alleys added as provided by law,
unless all the owners of land in the vacated area consent in writing to the
description of the area by: 1) the method used before the plat was made; 2)
metes and bounds; or 3) other appropriate description. However, a vacated tract
of five acres or more that is owned by one person, or jointly by two or more
persons, need not be described by lot number and may be described by metes and
bounds or some other method.

CHAPTER 1: LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 1.01 TITLE.
   This ordinance shall be known and may be cited hereinafter as the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Columbia City, Indiana.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.01) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.02 REPEAL OF PREVIOUS ORDINANCE.
   The City of Columbia City Zoning Ordinance Number 379, adopted on April 12,
1955, and all subsequent amendments thereto, are hereby repealed effective
coincident with the effective date of this ordinance.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.02) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.03 PURPOSE.
   As established by I.C. 36-7-4-601, the purpose of this ordinance is to
regulate and control the zoning of land and the consequent use of said land
within the city, and its jurisdictional area, in order to secure adequate
light, air, convenience of access; safety from fire, flood, and other danger;
lessen or avoid congestion in public ways; and promote the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general welfare. To achieve these
purposes, these regulations are specifically designed to:
   A.   Protect the character and stability of residential, recreation,
commercial, industrial, and open space areas within the city and promote their
orderly and beneficial development.
   B.   Provide privacy and convenience of access to property.
   C.   Regulate the intensity of land use and establish open areas surrounding
buildings and structures necessary to provide adequate light and ventilation,
and to protect public safety and health;
   D.   Regulate and limit the height of buildings and structures.
   E.   Lessen and avoid congestion on public streets by providing for off-
street parking and loading areas.
   F.   Regulate and limit the density of population based on the city's
ability to provide for water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other essential
public services.
   G.   Divide the city into zoning districts and establish by reference to a
map, the boundaries of said districts.
   H.   Fix reasonable standards to which land, buildings, structures, and
their uses must conform.
   I.   Prohibit uses, buildings, or structures which are incompatible with the
character of development or uses, buildings, or structures permitted within
specified zoning districts.
   J.   Prevent illegal additions or alterations of existing buildings or
structures.
   K.   Protect against fire, explosion, noxious fumes, odors, heat, dust,
smoke, glare, noise, vibration, radioactivity, and other nuisances and hazards,
in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare.
   L.   Prevent the overcrowding of land and the undue concentration of
buildings and structures so far as is possible and appropriate in each zoning
district by regulating the land around them.
   M.   Preserve and enhance the taxable value of land, buildings, and
structures throughout the city and its jurisdictional area.
   N.   Provide for the completion, restoration, reconstruction, or extension
of nonconforming uses. (Please see
Chapter 2).
   O.   Designate and define the powers and duties of the official(s)
administering and enforcing this ordinance.
   P.   Provide penalties for the violation of this ordinance.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.03) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.04 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT, AND SEPARABILITY.
   A.   In their interpretation and application the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, or other
provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or
other provision of law, those provisions which are more restrictive or impose
higher standards shall control.
      Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any
easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in enforcing these regulations, and such private provisions are not
inconsistent with these regulations or determinations thereunder, then such
private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and
determinations made thereunder. Private provisions can only be enforced
privately unless a public agency such as the Common Council or Plan Commission
has been made a party to such agreements.
      Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The city hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any
such part, provision, or application.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.04) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.05 COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set by this ordinance within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, except as hereinafter provided.
   A.   No building shall be erected, converted, placed, enlarged,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used
except for a purpose and in the manner permitted in the district in which the
building or land is located.
   B.   No land required for yards, open spaces, or off-street parking or
loading spaces about an existing building or any building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be considered as required yard or lot area for more
than one building, unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance.
   C.   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
located on a lot, and in no case shall there be more than one main building on
one lot, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance.
   D.   The provisions of these regulations shall be considered the minimum
requirements of the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
and general welfare. Where the provisions of the regulations of this ordinance
impose greater restrictions than those of any other statute, ordinance, or
regulation, the provisions of this ordinance shall be controlling. Where the
provisions of any other statute, ordinance, or regulation impose greater
restrictions than this ordinance, the provisions of such statute, ordinance, or
regulation shall be controlling.
   E.   This ordinance is not intended to abrogate or annul any easement,
covenant, or other private agreement. However, where any provision of this
ordinance is more restrictive or imposes a higher standard or requirement than
such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, the provisions of this
ordinance shall govern.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.05) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.06 JURISDICTIONAL AREA.
   This ordinance shall apply to all incorporated land within the city, and the

§ 1.08 SAVING PROVISIONS.
   This ordinance shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of prior existing zoning ordinance, or as discontinuing,
abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as
affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any
right of the city under any section or provision existing at the time of the
effective date of this ordinance, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful action of the city
except as shall be expressly provided for in this ordinance.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.08) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.09 EXCLUSION.
   Nothing in this ordinance or in any rules, regulations, or orders issued
pursuant to this ordinance shall be deemed to restrict or regulate or to

exercise of the power of eminent domain by the state, the United States of
America, or by their agencies.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 1.09) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 1.10 AMENDMENTS.
   The Common Council shall have the authority to amend, supplement, change,

50% of the area to be involved in the proposed zoning change.
   A.   Application and submission requirements for amendments: The application

Planning and Building Department. Said application shall be signed by the

         (f)   The date of the filing of the application.
         (g)   The present and proposed zoning classifications and the reasons

   B.   Fees and costs for amendments: In all cases where an application is
initiated by a private party, the application shall be accompanied by the fee
established by the Joint Advisory Board and on file in the offices of the
Columbia City/Whitley County Joint Planning and Building Department.
Additionally, the applicant, on filing such an application, shall pay all costs
and expenses associated with the application, whether or not the proposed
amendment is enacted, including the drafting, advertising, and recording of the
amendatory ordinance.
   C.   Approval process for amendments:
      1.   The Plan Commission: All such applications shall be referred to the
Plan Commission for consideration and a report. The Plan Commission shall hold
a public hearing, as required by law. Any such hearing may, for good cause
shown, be continued from time to time at the request of the applicant or at the
discretion of the Plan Commission.
         (a)   Certification of action: Upon completion of the public hearing,
the Commission shall approve, deny or send the application with no
recommendation. A certification, in writing, of its action, together with its
recommendation shall be transmitted to the Common Council.
         (b)   Approval of the rezoning of a portion of the property: The Plan
Commission may recommend, and the Common Council may approve, that an
application for a change of a zoning district classification be approved for
all, or only a portion of the property described in the application.
         (c)   Approval of a different classification: The Plan Commission may
recommend, and the Common Council may approve, a zoning district classification
other than the classification requested in the application as long as the
recommended and approved zoning district is of the same “family” and of lower
intensity. Example: Requested zoning district classification is R-2, Plan
Commission may recommend R-1, but not R-3 or commercial, industrial, or other
classification “family.”
      2.   The Common Council: After receiving the Plan Commission's
certification on the proposed amendment, the Common Council may proceed to take
action on the proposed amendment. At the first regular meeting after the
proposed amendment is certified, the Common Council may adopt, reject, or amend
the proposal.
         (a)   Adoption: If the Common Council adopts the proposal as certified
by the Plan Commission, it takes effect as any other ordinance.
         (b)   Failure to act: If the Common Council fails to act upon the
proposal within 90 days following the Plan Commission's certification, the
action recommended by the Plan Commission in their certification shall
automatically take effect.
         (c)   Rejection or amendment: If the Common Council rejects the action
recommended by the Plan Commission's certification, or amends the proposal
contrary to the recommendation of the Plan Commission, the proposal shall be
returned to the Plan Commission for its further consideration, with a statement
of the Common Council's reasons for the rejection or amendment.
            (1)   If the Plan Commission approves the action of the Common
Council, or fails to act within 45 days of the Common Council's report, the
Common Council's action stands as passed by the Common Council, upon the filing
of the Commission's report of approval, or the end of the 45-day period.
            (2)   If the Plan Commission rejects the Common Council's action,
the original action of the Common Council stands only if confirmed by another
vote of the Common Council within 45 days following the report of the Plan
Commission's rejection. If the Common Council fails to confirm its original
action within this 45-day period, then the action recommended in the Plan
Commission's original certification on the proposed amendment takes effect.
      3.   Basis for consideration and action: In preparing and/or considering
proposals to amend the zoning ordinance, the Plan Commission and the Common
Council shall pay reasonable regard to: [Taken from I.C. 36-7-4-603, the
Indiana Planning and Zoning Statute.]
         (a)   The Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   The current conditions and the character of current structures
and uses in each district.
         (c)   The most desirable use for which the land in each district is
adapted.
         (d)   The conservation of property values within the neighborhood and
jurisdiction.
         (e)   Responsible development and growth.
(I.C. 36-7-4-603)
      4.   Burden of proof: In assessing the relevance or acceptability of a
proposed amendment, the burden of proof in justifying the request shall rest
with the applicant, both before the Plan Commission and the Common Council.
      5.   Withdrawal: Any request for withdrawal of a legally filed
application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance must be filed in writing
and must be applied for prior to final action on the proposal by the Plan
Commission.
   D.   Reapplication for amendments: In the event that any application to
amend the zoning ordinance is denied on final review by the Common Council,
reapplication for the purposes of additional review of the same application
shall not be accepted by the Plan Commission until 12 months following the date
of the final action on the original application has elapsed, unless it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that substantial new evidence,
not available during the original review of the application, will be presented.

moving of any building or structure or any portion thereof, no new use,
extension or alteration of an existing use, or conversion from one use to

proposed word it is the responsibility of the person or firm hired to ensure
that all required permits and approvals have been secured prior to any work
being initiated.
         Blank forms shall be provided by the Department for the use of those
applying for permits as provided in this ordinance. Any permits issued by the

separate permit for each building or structure to be constructed, altered, or
erected except for accessory buildings which may be included in the permit for
the principal building when construction is simultaneous. Following issuance of
the required permit, the applicant's copy shall be prominently posted at the
site of the proposed work to the public view.
         Any ILP/BP under which no construction work has been commenced within
one year after the date of issuance of said permit or under which proposed
construction has not been completed within 18 months of the time of issuance
shall expire by limitation. A new permit must be obtained before any further
construction can occur. The new permit will be issued on the basis of the

or her agent, or contractor, or upon any person employed on the building or
structure for which such permit was issued, via a stop work order for
construction, which shall be posted in a prominent location, or a certified
letter citing the violation(s) for the character of use, and thereafter no such
construction or use shall proceed in violation of this ordinance.
      3.   Certificates of occupancy: No building or structure or part thereof
shall hereafter be constructed or altered until issuance of a proper ILP/BP. No
building or structure or part thereof shall be occupied without issuance of a

regular certificate of occupancy, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued by the Department for a period not exceeding 30 days from the issuance
of the temporary certificate of occupancy, during completion if not deemed to
endanger health or safety. Upon expiration of the original temporary
certificate of occupancy, one extension not exceeding 30 days may be granted
provided there remains no danger to health or safety.
      5.   Partial certificates of occupancy: Pending issuance of a regular

reconstruction, alteration, conversion, or maintenance in violation of this
ordinance may be effected by posting a stop work order, stating the nature of
the violation, to the owner of the property involved or to his or her agents or
to the person doing the work.
      8.   Compliance with permits and certificates: Permits or certificates
issued on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use,
arrangement, and construction set forth in approved plans and applications, and
no other use, arrangement, or construction. Use, arrangement, or construction
at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance,

1.14
§ 2.11 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A.   Scope of provisions: The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
nonconforming uses, lands, and structures. A nonconforming land use or
structure is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, on
the date this zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto became effective, and
which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable regulations of the
zoning ordinance or such amendment thereto. Such nonconformities may be
incompatible with and detrimental to permitted land uses and structures and may
inhibit present and fixture development of nearby properties; and they confer
upon their owners and users a position of unfair advantage.
   B.   Statement of intent: Existing nonconformities are not to be extended
expanded or changed; however, their continued, lawful existence, within the
requirements of this ordinance, is expressly acknowledged.
   C.   Nonconforming uses of lots: When, on the date of adoption or amendment
of this ordinance, an existing nonconforming use of a parcel or lot may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful but shall be subject to the
following provisions:
      1.   Enlargement: No such nonconforming use of parcel or lot shall be
enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied on the date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and no
additional accessory use, building, or structure shall be established thereon.
      2.   Relocation: No such nonconforming use of a parcel or lot shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not so
occupied on the date of adoption of this ordinance or to a parcel or lot not in
conformance with this ordinance.
      3.   Discontinuance: If cessation of such nonconforming use exceeds more
than 180 consecutive days, except where government action causes such
cessation, the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the
regulation and provisions set by this ordinance for the district in which such
parcel or lot is located. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an extension of
up to another 180 days as a special exception for the continuance of a
nonconforming use. For the purposes of the ordinance, cessation of the
nonconforming use shall mean no further active use of the property in the
principle nonconforming manner. Continued simple ownership or use of the
property for some clearly secondary purpose, such as storage, shall be
considered a continuance of the nonconforming use.
      4.   Change: An existing nonconforming use of land shall not cause
further departures from the zoning ordinance. Although an existing
nonconforming use may continue, except as hereinafter limited, it may not be
changed to another use, except to a use permitted in the district in which it
is situated and provided it complies with all other requirements of this
ordinance.
   D.   Nonconforming buildings and structures: Where, on the date of adoption
or amendment of this ordinance, a lawful building or structure exists that
could not be built under the regulations of this ordinance by reasons of
restrictions upon lot area, lot width, lot coverage, height, open spaces, off-
street parking, loading spaces and setbacks, or other characteristics, such
building or structure may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Enlargement: Such building or structure may be enlarged, expanded,
extended, or altered only if the nonconformity is removed, except as otherwise
provided herein. A building or structure may be improved to the extent that the
proposed improvement does not increase the nonconformity of the particular
setback or create a new and different nonconformity such as a different yard
setback, parking, or so forth.
      2.   Destruction: Should any such building or structure be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance.
      3.   Relocation: Should any such building or structure be moved for any
reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
   E.   Nonconforming uses of buildings and structures: Where, on the date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance, a lawful use of a building or
structure exists that is no longer permissible under the regulations of this
ordinance, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Enlargement: No existing building or structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be
enlarged, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally extended or
altered except in changing the use of such building or structure to a use
permitted in the district in which such building or structure is located.
      2.   Change in use not permitted: An existing nonconforming land use or
structure shall not cause further departures from the zoning ordinance.
Although an existing nonconforming use may continue, except as hereinafter
limited, it may not be changed to another use, except a use permitted in the
district in which it is situated and provided it complies with the requirements
of that district.
      3.   Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use of a building or structure
is discontinued or abandoned for more than 180 consecutive days (except where
government action prevents access to the premises) the building or structure
shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   F.   Repairs and maintenance: Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to
prohibit the restoration of any structure and its use where such structure has
been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent less
than 50% of its replacement value (excluding the value of the land, the cost of
preparation of land, and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming
use) at the time of destruction, provided the restoration of such structure and
its use in no way increases any former nonconformity, and provided further that
restoration of such structure is begun within six months of such destruction
and diligently prosecuted to completion within one year following such
destruction. Whenever such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the
control of the owner to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement value
(excluding the value of the land, the cost of land and the value of any
foundation adaptable to a conforming use) at the time of destruction, as
determined by the Building Inspector by any means within the control of the
owner to any extent whatsoever, the structure shall not be restored except in
full conformity with all regulations of the district in which such structure is
situated. When a structure is determined to be substandard by the proper
administrative official of the city under any applicable ordinance of the city,
and the cost of placing the structure in condition to satisfy the standards
under such ordinance shall exceed 50% of the reconstruction cost of the entire
structure, such nonconforming structure shall not be restored for the purpose
of continuing a nonconforming use.
   G.   Change in ownership or tenancy: There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership, or management of an existing nonconforming use, building, or
structure, provided there is no change in the nature or character, extent, or
intensity of such nonconforming use, building, or structure.
   H.   Completion of pending construction and building permits: To avoid undue
hardships, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been carried on diligently. Nothing herein contained shall require any change
in the plans or designated use of a building for which a building permit had
been heretofore issued, or the plans or final subdivision plats which have been
approved by the Board at the time of the passage of this ordinance.
   I.   Substandard nonconforming lots-of-record: In any district in which
single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings or structures may be erected on any single lot of record at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. Such lot must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership as of the date of adoption of this ordinance. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district. Yard dimensions
and other requirements, not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. If
two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment
of this ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements
for lot width and area as established by this ordinance, no portion of said
parcel or lot shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this ordinance, nor shall any division of the
parcel or lot be made which leaves remaining any parcel or lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in the ordinance.
   J.   Existence of a nonconforming use or structure:
      A nonconformity shall not be deemed to have existed on the date this
zoning ordinance, or any amendment thereto, became effective; unless:
      1.   It was in being on a continuous basis and to its fullest extent on
such date.
      2.   If such nonconformity is a use, such use had not been abandoned as
herein defined.
      3.   If such use existed lawfully under the previous zoning ordinance.
   In cases of doubt, and on specific questions raised, whether a nonconforming
use exists shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the Board of
Zoning Appeals after notice, a public hearing, and receipt of a report and
recommendation of the Planning Department.
   K.   Nonconforming uses not validated: A use in violation of a provision of
the ordinance which this repeals shall not be validated as a nonconforming use
by this ordinance and it shall conform to the provisions of this ordinance.
   L.   Non-Conformity as Basis for Variance: The existence of any present
nonconformity anywhere in the city or its jurisdictional area, shall not itself
be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance for other property.
   M.   Eventual conformance with environmental performance standards: Within
five years of the date of the adoption of this ordinance or the date of
adoption of any applicable amendments to this ordinance, any use which is or
becomes a nonconforming use, shall be brought into conformance with the
environmental performance standards established in § 2.10, environmental
performance standard regulations, of this chapter.

§ 2.12 CODE OF ETHICS.
   The Mayor or any member of the Common Council, Planning Commission, or Board
of Zoning Appeals to whom some private benefit, direct or indirect, financial
or otherwise, may come as a result of a public action concerning this
ordinance, shall not be a participant in that action. The possibility, not the
actuality, of a conflict shall govern. The individual experiencing a conflict
of interest shall declare his or her interest, abstain from voting on the
matter, and refrain from any deliberations on the matter. The individual shall
not discuss the matter with a fellow official for the purpose of influencing a
decision thereon.

following districts:
      1.   A-1 Agricultural District.
      2.   GB General Business District.
      3.   I-1 Light Industrial District.
      4.   In any district where the antennas are to be located upon pre-
existing structures or buildings owned or operated by units of government or
public utilities so long as the antennas and antenna support structures do not
exceed the height or more than 100 feet from adjacent ground level.
      5.   In any district, in a non-urban area, a term associated with I.C.
36-7-4-1103, URBAN AREA is defined in the Indiana Code as follows: all lands
and lots within the corporate boundaries of a municipality, any other lands or
lots used for residential purposes where there are at least eight residences
within any quarter mile square area, and other lands or lots that have been or
are planned for residential areas contiguous to the municipality.
   C.   Electronic communication towers shall be bound by the standards below
as well as the applicable requirements of the zoning district in which they are
located except where otherwise noted in subsection 2, Development Standards
below.
      1.   Procedural standards. All electronic communication towers shall meet
the following requirements:
         a.   The applicant for an electronic communication tower must
demonstrate that they have exhausted all efforts to locate the proposed
facilities upon existing antenna support structures in the geographical area of
the proposed electronic communication towers. They must submit a plan for all
their electronic communication towers throughout the jurisdictional area where
the city exercises planning and zoning jurisdiction. That plan must show
efforts to minimize the size and number of antenna support structures
throughout the geographical area, taking into consideration existing
technology.
         b.   The placement of antennas upon existing antenna support
structures may be administratively approved by the Planning Director.
         c.   In the event an antenna support structure ceases to be used, the
antenna support structure shall be removed within 180 days of termination of
use.
      2.   Development standards. All electronic communication towers shall
meet the following requirements:
         a.   The height of the antenna support structure shall not exceed 200
feet. The Board may approve an increase in this height requirement subject to
the submittal of FAA and FCC approvals, and as long as the tower will not
unreasonably interfere with any pre-existing private airports or landing
strips.
         b.   The antenna support structure shall be set back a minimum of 40
feet from the property line, unless the adjoining property is zoned or used for
a residential use. If the antenna support structure adjoins property, which is
zoned or used for residential use, the setback shall not be less than the
height of the support structure.
         c.   Except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration or
Federal Communications Commission, the antenna support structure shall not be
illuminated by any artificial means and shall not display strobe lights.
         d.   No signs or advertising shall be placed upon an antenna support
structure and associated equipment, buildings or structures.
         e.   The support structure and any antenna located on the support
structure must be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through
the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment. (Unless regulated by
FAA standards.)
         f.   All utility buildings and structures accessory to the antenna
support structure must be architecturally designed to blend into the
surrounding area.
         g.   A landscaping plan for the electronic communication tower shall
be submitted with the application and shall be substantially similar to
landscaping required for other uses in commercial and industrial zones.
         h.   All electronic communication towers shall be designed
structurally, electrically, electronically, and in all other respects to
accommodate the user's equipment and the equipment of at least two additional
service providers.
         i.   A qualified and licensed engineer must approve the design of the
antenna support structure and certify that it is constructed to comply with the
requirements set out in paragraph (h) above.
         j.   All applications shall include a notarized letter of intent
committing the antenna support structure owner or lessee on behalf of
themselves and their successors in interest that the antenna support structure
shall be shared with additional users if the additional user(s) agrees to meet
reasonable terms and conditions of shared use.
         k.   No transmissions from an electronic communication tower shall
interfere with any existing public safety communications.
      3.   Limitations on zoning authority.
         a.   The Board of Zoning Appeals in consideration of the special
exception shall not consider any evidence or base a denial of the location of
an electronic communication tower on any evidence concerning adverse
environmental or health effects of radio frequency emissions so long as those
emissions meet the standards of the Federal Communications Commission.
         b.   Nothing herein shall be construed as a prohibition of the
location of electronic communication towers within the planning jurisdiction of
the city.
         c.   Nothing herein shall be construed or applied to unreasonably
discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent service, or services,
which compete one against the other for various wireless communication
services.

   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost,
or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes made there
to, the Common Council may, by ordinance, adopt a new official zoning map which
shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions on the prior official zoning map,
but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the zoning ordinance
or the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map shall bear the
following words:
“This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in the
Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance Number 1995-7), adopted on June 5, 1995; this Map
replaces and supersedes the previous Official Zoning Map.”
   Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or totally destroyed, the
prior map, or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved
together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.

§ 3.05 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the provisions of this ordinance
as they pertain to the location of district boundaries where uncertainty exists
as to the location of the district boundaries in relation to the Official
Zoning Map. The following rules for interpretation shall apply:
   A.   A boundary indicated as approximately following the centerline of a
highway, street, alley, or easement shall be construed as following such
centerline.
   B.   A boundary indicated as approximately following a recorded lot line or
the line bounding a parcel shall be construed as following such line.
   C.   A boundary indicated as approximately following the corporate boundary
line of a city, village, school district, section, or township shall be
construed as following such line.
   D.   A boundary indicated as following a railroad line shall be construed as
being midway between the main tracks.
   E.   A boundary indicated as following a shoreline shall be construed as
following such shoreline, and in the event of change in a shoreline shall be
construed as following the actual shoreline.
   F.   A boundary indicated as following the centerline of a stream, river,
lake, or other body of water shall be construed as following such centerline.
   G.   A distance not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall
be determined by the scale of the map.
   H.   Where a physical or cultural feature existing on the ground is at
variance with that shown on the official zoning map, or in any other
circumstance not covered by Paragraphs A. through G. above, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall interpret the zoning district boundary.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 3.05) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)

         The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve other forms of roofing
materials as a special exception in those instances where it can be
specifically shown by the applicant that the material proposed is compatible
with that used on conventionally built housing in the immediate neighborhood of
the proposed location. Tar paper, tar, or asphalt “build-up” roofs, or riveted
or welded medal roofing shall not qualify for consideration under this
provision.
      3.   Permanent foundation:
         Type I and II manufactured homes shall be placed upon a permanent
foundation. For the purposes of this ordinance, a “permanent foundation” is
defined as a structural system that:
            (a)   Transfers loads imposed by the home to firm substrata;
            (b)   Has a lower surface placed below the frostline;
            (c)   Is attached to the home in such a way as to secure the home
to the foundation so that the home becomes a part of the real estate; and
            (d)   Causes the home to be assessed for taxation as an improvement
to the real estate.
         The design and construction of these load-bearing foundations shall be
in conformance with the requirements of the Indiana One and Two Family Dwelling
Code, and with the manufacturer's installation specifications.
      4.   Permanent perimeter enclosure: Type I and II manufactured homes
shall utilize a permanent perimeter enclosure. For the purposes of this
ordinance, a “permanent perimeter enclosure” shall mean a structural system
consisting of materials such as portland cement, mortared cement block, or
mortared brick completely enclosing (with the exception of required openings)
the space between the floor joists of the home and the under-floor grade. The
permanent perimeter enclosure and the permanent foundation may be constructed
as a unified structural system for those homes with a design compatible with
such an approach. Design and construction of the permanent perimeter enclosure
shall comply with the requirements of the Indiana One and Two Family Dwelling
Code.
      5.   Structural alteration: Due to its integral design, any structural
alteration or modification of a manufactured home after it is placed on the
site shall be approved by the authorized County Building Administrator.

§ 5.09 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   A.   Nonconforming homes: Where, on or before June 5, 1995, a manufactured
or mobile home has been lawfully placed and maintained on a tract of land that
would no longer be permissible under the provisions of this ordinance, such
home may be continued to be used, at that location, so long as it conforms to
the other applicable requirements of this ordinance.
   B.   Replacement of nonconforming homes: If, following June 5, 1995, should
a nonconforming manufactured or mobile home be removed, it shall only be
replaced by a manufactured home conforming to the requirements of this
ordinance.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 5.09) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 5.10 MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME PARK.
   A.   Purpose: The Manufactured Mobile Home Park (MMHP) designation is
intended to provide for and encourage, the organization and development of
mobile homes and other pre-manufactured dwellings in a single-family
residential neighborhood setting, and to:
      1.   Bring about manufactured home developments which are an asset to the
community and to prevent the development of those which would be a detriment to
the community.
      2.   To promote manufactured home developments with the character of
residential neighborhoods.
      3.   To protect the health, safety, and welfare of manufactured home
residents and the surrounding community.
      4.   To harmonize this type of residential development with other
existing and proposed land uses.
      5.   To assure adequate service by essential public facilities and
services such as roads, police, water and sewers, drainage structures, and that
the establishment of any manufactured home development shall not equal
excessive public expense for the facilities and services.
   B.   Location of manufactured/mobile home park: To adequately insure the
purpose of the manufactured/mobile home park designation, applicants will be
required to be in an R-3 Multi-Family Residential District and to acquire a
special exception is set forth in
Chapter 12, Board of Zoning Appeals.
   C.   Limitation on permitted uses: Within all nonconforming parks, the
permitted uses of such parks shall be limited to the following:
      1.   Manufactured homes, mobile homes, and modular homes.
      2.   Accessory buildings or structures, under park management and
supervision, used only as office space, storage, laundry facilities, recreation
facilities, garage storage, or other necessary service for park resident use
only. An accessory building or structure shall not exceed 25 feet in height, or
two stories; and shall meet the requirements of the City Building Code.
      3.   Each residence may have one accessory building on a lot. The
accessory building shall not exceed a height of 16 feet, nor two stories in
height, nor be closer than 5 feet from any side or rear property line.
      4.   Signs as regulated by
Chapter 11, Signs.
   D.   General regulations:
      1.   Minimum development area: The total land area of a manufactured home
development shall be not less than ten acres.
      2.   Application of regulations: A manufactured home unit shall not be
permitted to occupy a site, either initially when brought into a manufactured
home development or upon addition to or replacement of an existing manufactured
home, which violates the yard or area requirements established herein. It is
recognized that due to the pre-manufactured nature of such homes, lots
exceeding the minimum area requirements of this ordinance may be necessary to
accommodate some models within the required yard setbacks. Recognizing this
fact, it is assumed that suitable provision will be made by the developers of
the manufactured home development in their advance planning to provide for such
homes in their design. Based upon this guideline, the fact that the size of a
particular home, or class of home, would create a violation of any of the yard
requirements of this ordinance when applied to a specific lot, shall not, in
itself, be considered an adequate basis for the granting of a variance from
such requirements. Further, it is the express intent of this ordinance to
encourage and promote manufactured home developments similar in nature to and
recognizable as, single-family residential neighborhoods. The mere desire of an
individual to rezone a single lot, or a series of lots not clearly in
conformance with the intent, shall not be considered adequate basis for a
variance from the minimum development size requirements previously stated in
this chapter.
      3.   Recorded plat required: No permit for the erection or location of a
manufactured home within a manufactured/mobile home park shall be issued until
a subdivision plat for the land encompassed by the manufactured home park has
been approved in accordance with the requirements of the subdivision
regulations. It is the intention of this requirement to provide for the
eventual sale of the lots within the manufactured home development to the home
owners who shall reside upon those lots. The recording of a site plan or other
similar instrument shall not be considered as meeting this requirement.
      4.   Minimum accommodations: Recognizing that a variety of manufactured
buildings exist not specifically designed for residential purposes, each
manufactured home placed, erected or located within a manufactured home
development shall contain, at a minimum, a flush toilet, sleeping
accommodations, a tub or shower bath, kitchen facilities, and plumbing and
electrical connections designed for attachment to appropriate external systems.
      5.   Permanent foundation/perimeter enclosure required: All manufactured
homes located within an approved manufactured home development shall be placed
upon a permanent foundation and provided with a perimeter enclosure as defined
by §
5.08 E.4. of this chapter. For the purposes of this ordinance, placement of a
manufactured home upon uniform jacks or blocks, upon a concrete pad, skirted
with sheet metal, aluminum, wood, or other temporary material, and secured by
tiedowns, shall not be considered a permanent foundation and perimeter
enclosure meeting this requirement.
   E.   Area regulations and performance standards:
      1.   Park area regulations and performance standards:
         (a)   The minimum area for a manufactured/mobile home park is ten
acres.
         (b)   Buffer zone: A 40 feet wide buffer zone along the perimeter of
the manufactured/mobile home park shall contain plantings so as to provide an
opaque barrier, or screen, between the park and adjacent property and along
adjacent roadways. No plantings or other visual barriers shall encroach beyond
the home park property line. No home or accessory structure shall encroach upon
the buffer zone.
         (c)   Manufactured homes shall be located on lots containing an area
of at least 4,500 square feet, or more.
         (d)   For uses other than manufactured homes, the lot area shall be
adequate to provide the yard area required to meet the setback requirements of
this district and the off-street parking requirements contained in
Chapter 10, but in no case shall be less than 4,500 square feet.
         (e)   Not less than 10%, exclusive of community building facilities,
of the gross area of the park, and not less than 10% of any expansion area,
must be improved for recreational activity for the residents of the park.
         (f)   Entrance exit: The park shall be provided with primary and
secondary access points with suitable signage placed in a landscaped setting.
      2.   Individual lot area regulations and performance standards:
         (a)   Minimum lot depth shall be 100 feet.
         (b)   Minimum lot width at the minimum building setback line shall be
45 feet. Where a lot fronts on a cul-de-sac, a 35-foot lot width at the street
right-of-way is required.
         (c)   Front yard setback: Not less than 25 feet.
         (d)   Side yards setback: Not less than eight feet on each side of the
dwelling.
         (e)   Rear yard setback: Not less than ten feet.
         (f)   Height requirements: The height of structures within the park
shall not exceed 25 feet or two stories. Accessory structures shall not exceed
16 feet.
         (g)   Off-street parking: Off-street parking for two vehicles shall be
provided for each home. In no case shall that portion of the paved area
designated for the off-street parking encroach upon the street right-of-way.
   F.   Development standards:
      1.   Design and construction of improvements: All improvements, including
but not limited to roadways, sidewalks, storm drainage facilities, water
distribution facilities and sanitary sewer facilities shall be designed and
constructed in conformance with the adopted standards and specifications of the
city for public improvements whether intended as private improvements
maintained by the owner(s) or for eventual dedication to the city.
      2.   Access: A lot within a manufactured home development shall have
frontage on, and access to, a public or private street. Where double-frontage
lots occur, access shall be limited to the minor street.
      3.   Sidewalks: Sidewalks not less than four feet in width shall be
required on both sides of all interior streets. In those instances where the
manufactured home development borders one side of an arterial or collector
street, sidewalks conforming to this requirement shall only be required upon
that side of the street.
      4.   Underground utilities: All electric, telephone, and other utilities
extended within the home development to each lot shall be constructed
underground. All water and sanitary sewage service connections shall not exceed
ten feet in length above ground directly beneath the manufactured home, and
shall be suitably protected against freezing.
      5.   Street trees required:
         A deciduous tree of a minimum of two inches in caliper as measured one
foot above the ground level shall be planted on each lot within the
manufactured/mobile home park.
         Some trees, such as ailanthus, silver maple, poplar, boxelder, catalpa
or willow have roots which penetrate through or under the surface of any public
place in the city, therefore they are hereby declared to be an undesirable
species of tree for street planting.
      6.   Landscape maintenance: The landscaping materials depicted upon the
approved plat shall be considered a binding element of the project. The
developer, his or her successor, or subsequent owners of the overall
development shall be responsible for its continued maintenance. Plant material
which exhibits evidence of insect pests, disease, and/or damage shall be
removed and replaced within the next planting season. This maintenance
responsibility shall rest with the developer and subsequent owners for the
duration of the manufactured/mobile home park.
      7.   Street lights: Street lights are required to be put in at the
developers expense, as per Director of Community Development and/or Board of
Public Works and Safety standards.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 5.10) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 5.11 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME PARKS.
   A.   General: Mobile home parks are a historic anachronism. Originally
designed to serve the same function as today's recreational vehicle parks and
campgrounds, changes in technology and the public's attitudes towards the use
of mobile homes as residences have largely changed mobile home parks from
locations of temporary occupancy to locations of permanent residence.
Unfortunately, as mobile homes have become larger and more permanent, the
design and organization of mobile home parks have not correspondingly changed
to keep pace. As a result, such parks often reflect unacceptable density of
development, lack of open space, substandard private improvements, and a
general lack of amenities, among other problems, not conducive to the
development of a single-family residential neighborhood.
   B.   Intent: Nonconforming mobile home parks are declared by this chapter to
be incompatible with the buildings, structures, and uses permitted by this
ordinance. Such parks are not to be expanded and should be reduced to
conformity as quickly as the fair interest to the parties involved will permit.
With this background, it is the intent of this section to permit such
nonconforming parks to continue until such time as they are discontinued,
damaged (see §
5.11 G. of this chapter), or removed.
   C.   Application of the regulations: Where, on the date of adoption, or
amendment of this ordinance, a lawful mobile home park existed that is no
longer permissible under the provisions of this ordinance, such mobile home
park may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject, to the
following provisions.
      1.   Violations not validated: A nonconforming mobile home park in
violation of a provision of the ordinance which this repeals shall not be
validated by the adoption of this ordinance.
      2.   Enlargement: No such nonconforming mobile home park shall be
enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy on the date of adoption or amendment
of this ordinance and no additional accessory use, building, or structure shall
be established thereon, unless in complete compliance with the requirements of
this ordinance. Nor shall the mobile homes within the existing site be
rearranged to increase their number or density within the existing confines of
the park.
      3.   Relocation: No such nonconforming mobile home park shall be moved in
whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not so occupied on
the date of adoption of this ordinance.
      4.   Destruction: Should any such nonconforming mobile home park be
destroyed by any means to an extent of 50 or more percent of its replacement,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the requirements of
this ordinance (see §
5.11 B. of this chapter).
      5.   Discontinuance: If such nonconforming mobile home park ceases to
exist for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days (except
where government action causes such cessation) the subsequent use of such
parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this
ordinance for the district in which such parcel or lot is located.
   D.   Ownership: Nonconforming mobile home parks shall remain in one
ownership and shall be primarily designed for the purpose of renting spaces for
the placement of mobile home dwelling units. In no instance shall a
nonconforming mobile home park be sold as individual lots for permanent mobile
home residence.
   E.   Minimum distances: Within all nonconforming mobile home parks, the
minimum distances maintained between mobile homes shall be maintained as they
currently exist on the date of adoption of this ordinance, subject to no
existing violation being present from the previous ordinance which this
ordinance repeals. In no case shall the mobile homes within a nonconforming
mobile home park be rearranged to increase their number or density within the
existing confines of the park. In addition, these minimum distances shall be
subject to the health and safety requirements of the city's adopted Building
Fire Codes, applicable state laws, and/or a development plan previously
approved by the city.
   F.   Minimum accommodations: All mobile homes within nonconforming mobile
home parks shall be subject to the requirements of §
5.10 D.4. of this chapter.
   G.   Limitation on permitted uses: Within all nonconforming mobile home
parks, the permitted uses of such park shall be limited to the following:
      1.   Manufactured homes, mobile homes and modular homes.
      2.   Accessory buildings or structures, under park management and
supervision, used only as office space, storage, laundry facilities, recreation
facilities, garage storage, or other necessary service for park resident use
only. An accessory building or structure shall not exceed 25 feet in height,
nor two stories; and shall meet the requirements of the City Building Code.
      3.   Each residence may have one accessory building on a lot. The
accessory building shall not exceed a height of 16 feet, nor two stories in
height, nor be closer than 5 feet from any side or rear property line.
      4.   Signs as regulated by
Chapter 11.
   H.   Periodic replacement of mobile homes: Recognizing the mobile home parks
are designed for the purpose of renting or leasing locations for mobile homes
owned by others, it is understood that, from time-to-time, existing mobile
homes within the park will be replaced. Such replacements are permissible,
provided the other requirements of this ordinance are maintained.
   I.   Park maintenance: Park owners and management are required to maintain
the physical and natural facilities and features of the park in a neat,
orderly, and safe condition.
   J.   Parking: No parking area or parking space which exists at the time this
ordinance becomes effective or which subsequent thereto is provided for the
purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall thereafter be
relinquished or reduced in any manner.
   K.   Siding/skirting: All manufactured or mobile homes without a permanent
perimeter enclosure shall have an approved foundation siding/skirting enclosing
the entire perimeter of the home. Foundation siding/skirting and back-up
framing shall be of weather-resistant, noncombustible, or self-extinguishing
materials, which blend with the exterior siding of the home. Below grade level
and for a minimum distance of six inches above finish grade, the materials
shall be unaffected by decay or oxidation. The siding shall be installed in
accordance with the manufacture's recommendations or approved equal standards.
The siding shall be ventilated by openings, which shall have a net area of not
less than one and one-half square feet for each linear feet of exterior
perimeter. The openings shall be covered with corrosion resistant wire mesh not
larger than ½ inch in any dimension. The under-floor area shall be provided
with an 18-inch by 24-inch minimum size access crawl hole, which shall not be
blocked by pipes, ducts, or other construction interfering with the
accessibility of the under-floor space, or other approved access mechanism.
   L.   Support system: All mobile homes not placed on a permanent foundation,
shall be installed on a support system in conformance with the manufacturer's
installation specifications or with the support system regulations in the ANSI/
NFPA 501a 1977 Installations Standards.
   M.   Existence of a nonconforming mobile home park: In cases of doubt, and
on specific questions raised concerning whether a mobile home park has
nonconforming status, or if an element of such park has nonconforming status,
it shall be treated as a question of fact and shall be decided by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
(1980 Code, Ch. 156, § 5.11) (Ord. 1995-7, passed 6-5-1995)
§ 5.12 CONTINUATION OF HISTORIC PUDs.
   Where a residential planned unit development ("PUD"), formerly known as
"planned unit project", was approved as a special exception prior to the
effective date of this ordinance, the development standards set forth in the
special exception approval shall continue to be in effect regardless of the
current zoning classification. Any standards not specified in the approval
shall be governed by the current zoning classification.
   The standards of such a special exception PUD shall cease to be in effect if
the PUD is modified so as to alter the essential character of the original
approved PUD, as determined by the Director. At such time, the provisions of
the current zoning classification and/or §
2.11 apply.

CHAPTER 8: FLOOD HAZARD   OVERLAY DISTRICT
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 8.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of Columbia City does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 2012-16, passed 6-26-2012; Am. Ord. 2015-10, passed 3-24-2015; Am. Ord.
2015-11, passed 3-24-2015)
§ 8.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (1)   The flood hazard areas of Columbia City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2012-16, passed 6-26-2012; Am. Ord. 2015-10, passed 3-24-2015; Am. Ord.
2015-11, passed 3-24-2015)
§ 8.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
   (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (6)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2012-16, passed 6-26-2012; Am. Ord. 2015-10, passed 3-24-2015; Am. Ord.
2015-11, passed 3-24-2015)
§ 8.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this ordinance are:
   (1)   To protect human life and health.
   (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges,
located in floodplains.
   (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-blight
areas.

§ 8.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage,
and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding
is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding), where average depths are  between
one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of
a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete
for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood
protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion.
No base flood elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE) means a structure with a floor
area of 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure, and the use of which is incidental to the use of
the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal
initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and shall be designed
to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE) means any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this ordinance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM), with base flood depths from one to three feet,
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual
chance flood.
   BASEMENT means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary
between Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY means the floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING  - see STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.

Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY means a facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and  emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but
flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating
communities, but is not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to:
      (1)   construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, orinstalling a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      (4)   construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
      (5)   mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      (6)   construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      (7)   storage of materials; or
      (8)   any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities, such as the maintenance of existing
structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing  roads; or
gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices, that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE is a certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM means the first phase under which a community participates
in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM) means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD-PRONE AREA means any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source (see FLOOD).
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG) is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA (see FREEBOARD).
   FLOODPLAIN means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland,
lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the
regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe
districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS means this ordinance and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING) is a method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation, with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris-impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE is a form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Columbia City Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE means any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property-specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR) means an official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F) means an official
revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on
fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE means the lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR means the lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   the top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   the top of the basement floor;
      (3)   the top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   the top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   the top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure, where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of floodwaters, unless:
         a).   the walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters, by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         b).   the total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         c).   such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME means a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual
cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term
risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
mitigation is two-fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) is the federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929 as corrected in 1929, is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION means any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY means the floodway of any river or stream other
than a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993, is a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile,  abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD is the flood that has a one-percent (1%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that
begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See
REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR) is an official republication of a community’s
FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood
elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas,
or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE means anything which is injurious to the safety
or health ofan entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less, when measured at the largest horizontal
projections;
      (3)   designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM means the phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available, based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure
that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood
elevation at any location is as defined in Section 8.07 of this ordinance. The
REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the terms BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict and development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdictions
of Columbia City subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
Columbia City are generally identified as  such on the Whitley County, Indiana,
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated May 4, 2015, as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM
as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
   START OF CONSTRUCTION includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds,
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed
by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“repetitive loss” or “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
requirements, or any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   SUSPENSION means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this ordinance. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2  percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2 percent.
   ZONE means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the
severity or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A - see A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X means areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and
C.)

§ 8.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.
   This ordinance’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.
   (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Columbia City, delineated on the one-
percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Whitley
County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas, dated May 4, 2015, and the
corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated May 4, 2015, as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.
   (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Columbia City, delineated as an “A
Zone” on the Whitley County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map, dated May 4, 2015, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, that party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or the absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood-prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
   (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective, less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 8.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.

§ 8.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this ordinance does not create any
liability on the part of Columbia City, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

§ 8.14 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to
comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions
of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. All
violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for Columbia City. All
violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $50.00 for each offense.
   (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues to exist.
   (2)   The Columbia City Common Council shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

Floodplain Administrator, on forms furnished by him or her, prior to any
development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following:
plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the
location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:
   (1)   Application Stage.
      a).   A description of the proposed development.
      b).   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams.
      c).   A legal description of the property site.
      d).   A site development plan, showing existing and proposed development
locations, and existing and proposed land grades.
      e).   Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD.
      f).   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed.
      g).   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering study is required, and any watercourse changes submitted to DNR for
approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See §
8.17 (6) for additional information.)
   (2)   Construction Stage. Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an
elevated structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of
the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted.
The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any
further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to
make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order
for the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation
certification shall be at the applicant’s risk.
   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed
structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer and
certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the floodproofing
certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 8.18 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all SFHAs and known flood-prone areas, the following provisions are
required:
   (1)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
   (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
   (3)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
   (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, utility meters, and other service facilities shall be located at/
above the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components below the FPG. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and
telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the FPG.
   (6)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (7)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (8)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (9)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure
that is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall meet the
requirements of “new construction” as contained in this ordinance.
   (10)   Parking lots, driveways, and sidewalks within the SFHA shall be
constructed with permeable materials.
   (11)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume of
space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the BFE
shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of excavation
taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the
volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of one to one) due to the fill or
structure.
      a).   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the same
property in which the authorized fill or structure is located.
      b).   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to take
place outside of, but adjacent to, the floodplain, provided that the excavated
volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the same
property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled.

to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding, and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement.
      g).   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator with a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites, demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (Sections 8.18 through 8.25).

§ 8.19 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:
   (1)   In addition to the requirements of Section
8.18, all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
      a).   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor area
greater than 400 square feet.
      b).   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure, where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land).
      c).   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure, where the
costs of restoring thestructure to its before-damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred.
      d).   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days.
      e).   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This ordinance does not apply to returning the
existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was
removed to avoid flood damage.
      f).   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive-loss structure.
      g).   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous addition or improvement constructed since the community’s first
floodplain ordinance.
   (2)   Residential Structures. New construction or substantial improvement of
any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood
elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Section
8.19 (4).
   (3)   Non-Residential Structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
Section 8.19 (4). Structures located in all “A Zones” may be floodproofed in
lieu of being elevated, if done in accordance with the following:
      a).   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the structure has been designed so that, below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in Section
8.17 (12).
      b).   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention
and without an outside source of electricity.
   (4)   Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures, with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade, shall be designed to preclude
finished living space, and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
      a).   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area).
      b).   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above the
exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher.
      c).   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
      d).   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      e).   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
      f).   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation
at or higher than the exterior grade.
      g).   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction in
the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to a hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted, such as typical foundation air vent
device.
      h).   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit, acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of Section
8.19 (4). Periodic inspections will be conducted by the Floodplain
Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit shall be recorded in the
office of the Whitley County Recorder.
      i).   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement, declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Whitley County Recorder.
   (5)   Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
      a).   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
      b).   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of
the structure before sloping below the BFE.
      c).   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
      d).   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
      e).   The top of the lowest floor, including basements, shall be at or
above the FPG.
      f).   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
   (6)   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
      a).   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on
a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a
flood:
         (i)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG, and
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         (ii)   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space, and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in Section
8.19 (4).
         (iii)   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
      b).   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on
a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been
substantially damaged by a flood:
         (i)   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade,
and are securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         (ii)   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space, and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in Section
8.19 (4).
         (iii)   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
      c).   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
         (i)   be on site for less than 180 days; and
         (ii)   be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-
type utilities and security devices, and having no permanently attached
additions); or
         (iii)   meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated
earlier in this section.
   (7)   Accessory Structures. Relief from the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
      a).   Shall not be used for human habitation.
      b).   Shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials.
      c).   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum

2015-11, passed 3-24-2015)
§ 8.22 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   Located within SFHAs, established in Section 8.07, are areas designated as
floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under
the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities, such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc., undertaken
before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does
exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences
in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a
non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river
floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or
letter or authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, granting approval for construction in the
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (Sections
8.18 through
8.25) of this ordinance have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   No development shall be allowed that, acting alone or in combination with
existing or future development, will adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined as
an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood by at least fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) of a foot, as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition, to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition, as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees)
the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found in 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.

§ 8.23 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the
provisions contained in Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of this ordinance
have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new
or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 8.24 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/
ORFLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a
permit for construction in a floodway, or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade, has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
      Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for
construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain
development permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain
development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions contained in
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of this ordinance have been met.
   (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis, showing the limits of
the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in Provisions for Flood
Hazard Reduction of this ordinance have been met.
   (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot, and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.

      a).   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      b).   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship.
      c).   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Section
8.22 or Section
8.24 (1) of this ordinance may be granted.
   (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Section

CHAPTER 9: DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL
§ 9.01 INTENT.
   It is recognized by this ordinance that there is a value to the public in
establishing safe and convenient traffic movement to and from higher density
sites, both within the site and on the access streets; that there is value in
encouraging a harmonious relationship of buildings and uses both within a site
and in relation to adjacent uses; that there is a value in insuring that new
development is an investment in the continued quality of life of the community
rather than a cost; and further, that there are benefits to the public in
conserving natural resources. Toward this end, the review and approval of a
development plan by the Executive Committee of the Plan Commission is required
of certain buildings and types of development that can be expected to have an
impact on natural resources, traffic patterns, and intensity, adjacent land
uses, and the character of future urban development.

for the construction of the following buildings, structures, or uses until a
development plan in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance has been
reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the Plan Commission:
   A.   Construction of any primary commercial or industrial building.
   B.   Construction of an addition to a commercial or industrial building of
5,000 square feet of gross floor area; or, the construction of a secondary
commercial or industrial building of square feet of gross floor area.
   C.   Construction of a multiple-family building containing three or more
dwelling units.
   D.   Construction of an addition or renovation of an existing residential
structure which would increase the total number of dwelling units within the
structure to three or more. This includes rooming or boarding establishments.
   E.   Construction of three or more residential structures on one lot,
parcel, or tract of land, where each structure contains two or more dwelling
units.
   F.   Construction in the Central Business District where the proposed
development does not conform to the setback lines.
   G.   Additional or multiple signs may be permitted by the Executive
Committee for one or more entrances to a residential development.

areas, or that can be encroached upon by a motor vehicle, shall be provided
with a permanent portland cement concrete curb as approved by the City's
Director of Community Development and/or the Board of Public Works and Safety
to restrict the destruction of the landscaped areas by vehicles. Adequate
scuppers and/or weep holes shall be provided through the curbing to permit
drainage.
   J.   Innovative landscape plans: It is recognized that standardized
requirements are not always responsive to all situations and circumstances. In
order to provide an avenue for the development of creative approaches to
landscaping, the Plan Director, in conjunction with the City's Director of
Community Development and/or the Board of Public Works and Safety shall have
the authority under this section to approve innovative landscape plan. Such
plans may vary the arrangement and location of landscaping and landscape areas,
such as clustering of trees, berming, and locating of plots for traffic-control
purposes that provide for a unique and functional designs using topography and
existing site characteristics provided the total area of all landscaping and
the total amount of landscape materials is maintained.
      In those instances where a plan is denied, or the applicant is aggrieved
of any decision of the Plan Director and City's Director of Community
Development, the applicant may appeal said decision to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.

number of parking spaces for a new or established expanding business, shall be
considered the total number of employees present upon the property during the
maximum shift.
   B.   Parking exception for churches: Off-street parking facilities required
for churches may be reduced by 50% where churches are located in nonresidential
districts and within 300 feet of usable public or private off-street parking
areas, and further provided that an agreement filed on record with the County
Recorder is provided reflecting that the use of such accessory parking
facilities by the church will be permitted by the property owner. For the
purposes of this ordinance, the term “church” shall be considered a building
used principally for religious worship, but shall not include or mean an
undertaker's chapel, funeral building, a religious educational building, day
care center, group home of any nature, or any other similar venture.
   C.   Parking for multiple use buildings: The number of parking spaces
required for land or buildings used for two or more purposes, shall be the sum
of the requirements for various uses, computed in accordance with this
ordinance. Parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing
the required parking facilities for any other use, except churches.
   D.   Use of required parking spaces: Required accessory off-street parking
facilities provided for the commercial and industrial uses hereinafter listed
(in §
10.05 B. and C. of this chapter) shall be solely for the parking of motor
vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants, or employees of such
uses and shall not be used for the storage of other vehicles, boats, motor
homes, campers, mobile homes, or materials or for the parking of delivery
trucks or tractor trailers used in conducting the business or use. In no case
shall any parking spaces devoted to the principal use of a lot be leased,
rented, or sold for the purpose of use by any other person, firm, company,
corporation, or use other than those located upon the property.
      Exception: In the event of special limited time sales or seasonal events,
the Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a temporary permit for a
specified period, with the opportunity for renewal for a longer period.
   E.   Number of entrances and exits: There shall be not more than one
entrance and one exit or one combined entrance and exit along any street. In
the instance of multiple properties along street frontage, the Director of
Community Development and/or the Board of Public Works and Safety may require
the use of joint access points and the recording of appropriate cross-easements
at their discretion. Concerning corner lots located at the intersection of a
major and minor road, the access to the parking area shall be limited to the
minor road. In the instance of the intersection of two major roads, the access
to the parking area shall be as approved by the Director of Community
Development and/or the Board of Public Works and Safety for the alleviation of
traffic congestion and interference of traffic movement along the related
street.
   F.   Accessory parking lots: All required off- street parking or loading
spaces shall be provided on the same parcel of land occupied by the use or
building to which it is appurtenant; provided, however, that where there are,
in the judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals, practical difficulties in
satisfying the requirement for parking space and/or if the public safety or
convenience would be better served by another location, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may authorize an alternate location for any portion of the required
parking for a nonresidential use which will adequately serve the conditions:
      1.   Required accessory off-street parking facilities may be provided
elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located,
provided that the property occupied as parking is in the same possession as the
principal use served, either by deed, by easement, or by long-term lease which
has a term equal to or exceeding the projected life of the facility occupied by
the principal use, and further provide that the owner shall be bound by
covenants filed on record in the office of the Whitley County Recorder,
requiring the owners, heirs, or assigns, to maintain the required number of
off-street parking spaces during the existence of such principal use is
provided to the Planning and Building Department.
      2.   Pedestrian access shall be available within a walking distance of
not more than 300 feet measured from the nearest point of public access
accessory parking area.
      3.   Such separated parking space shall be usable without causing
unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential neighborhood or
hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic.
      4.   All accessory parking lots shall be located on property zoned within
the same, or similar, zoning district.
   G.   Changes in use: No off-street parking space required under this
ordinance shall be used for any other purpose. Where a change in use creates
greater parking requirements than the amount being provided, an occupancy
permit shall not be issued until provision is made for the increased amount of
required off-street parking.
   H.   Additions to buildings, structures, or uses: Where an addition is made
to an existing structure served by an existing, nonconforming parking lot, only
the additional parking required for the proposed addition shall conform to all
of the requirements of the ordinance. The existing parking area shall not be
required to be reconstructed to come into conformance with the current off-
street parking requirements as a result of the addition, with the exception of
the paving requirements of §
10.03 of this chapter. However, these paving requirements shall only apply to
customer or tenant parking and the access drives to the street.
   I.   Existing parking: No parking area or parking space which exists at the
time this ordinance becomes effective or which subsequent thereto is provided
for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall
thereafter be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements
established by this ordinance.
   J.   Maintenance of parking facilities: Any persons operating or owning a
parking lot shall keep it free, as may be practical, of dust, loose particles,
trash, debris, and broken glass, and shall promptly remove the snow and ice
from the surface of the parking lot. Such persons shall also keep all adjacent
sidewalks free from dirt, ice, sleet, and snow and shall keep the sidewalks in
a safe condition for use by pedestrians. All signs, markers, or any other
methods used to indicate direction of traffic movement and location of parking
spaces shall be maintained in a neat and legible condition. Likewise any walls,
landscaping, including trees and shrubbery, as well as surfacing and curbing of
the parking lot, shall be maintained in good condition throughout its use for
parking purposes, and the Director of Community Development and/or the Board of
Public Works and Safety shall have the authority to prohibit the use of the
area for parking purposes unless and until proper maintenance, repair, or
rehabilitation is completed, including the replacement of any landscaping
material which may die from time to time, or the failure of the landscape
irrigation or surface drainage system within the parking area.
   K.   Shared parking: Notwithstanding the parking requirements set out in §
10.05 of this chapter, the number of parking spaces may be reduced by 20%, at
the discretion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, if the developer demonstrates
that the parking required is so located and designed such that shared parking
within the purposed development meets the minimum requirements of this chapter.
A reduction in required parking shall not be permitted in those instances where
the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that there is a potential for changes in
use, over the short term, creating a change in the basic mixture of uses upon
which the justification for shared parking is based.
      Note: For the purposes of this section, adequate data shall be considered
a professionally prepared survey, conducted under replicable conditions, which
yield a statistically significant result.

Revitalization Area, as established by City Ordinance Number 984, (see Plate 5)

proposed work, it shall become the responsibility of the person or firm hired
to ensure that all required permits and approvals have been secured prior to
any work being initiated.
      Blank forms shall be provided by the Department for the use of those

issuance shall expire by limitation.
   D.   Voiding of sign permit: A permit may be revoked by the Department at
any time prior to the completion of the sign for which the same was issued,
when it shall appear to him or her that there is any departure from the plans,
specifications, or conditions, as required under terms of the permit, that the
same was procured by false representation, or that any provisions of this
ordinance are being violated. Written notice of such revocation shall be served
upon the owner, his or her agent, or contractor, or upon any person employed of
the building or structure for which such permit was issued, via a stop work
order, which shall be posted in a prominent location, and thereafter no such
construction shall proceed.
   E.   Compliance with sign permits: Sign permits issued on the basis of
approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in the approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this section as
provided herein.
   F.   Violations: If it is found that a sign is in violation of this
ordinance, the Department, or its designee, shall give notice to the owner of
the sign, or if the owner cannot be located, to the owner or property
management agent of the premises on which the sign is located or, if the sign

ordinance shall be subject to the penalties established in §
1.14 of this ordinance.

§ 12.10 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   A commercial or professional activity, regardless of whether engaged in for
profit, conducted by one or more residents in his, her, or their dwelling, or
structure accessory thereto, and is clearly incidental and secondary to the use
of the principal structure for dwelling purposes, and is located within a
residentially or agriculturally zoned district may be classified as a home
occupation.
   A.   General restrictions and limitations: Home occupations shall be
permitted as an accessory use to a permitted residential use in any
residentially or agriculturally zoned district subject to the requirements of
this section.
      1.   Home occupations shall be entirely operated from an enclosed, four-
walled structure, provided that all doors (including garage doors greater than
four feet in width) shall be kept closed during use of the structure for a home
occupation, except during incidental use for ingress and egress.
      2.   Such use shall not occupy a total floor area greater than the amount
of square footage represented by 20% of the total square footage of the
principal structure whether operated from within the dwelling or in an
accessory structure. For the purposes of this section, “total floor area of the
dwelling” shall not include basements or cellars (whether finished for
habitation or not), garages (whether attached or detached), attics, or other
non-habitable portions of the residence. For the purposes of this section, the
total floor area occupied by the home occupation activity shall include the
total floor area of any room or rooms, where the home occupation is conducted
or supplies, material, inventory, or equipment is stored.
      3.   The use of the property for an accessory home occupation shall be
clearly incidental and subordinate to its principal use as a residence by its
occupants, and shall not dominate or cause variations in the residential
character of the property, principal structure, or surrounding neighborhood.
      4.   There shall be no visible evidence of the home occupation, including
but not limited to alterations to the exterior of the residence which changes
the character thereof as a residence, exterior displays, or the outdoor storage
of materials or equipment used in the home occupation. For the purpose of this
section, “outdoor storage” shall include not only equipment or materials
generally used in the occupation, but also the accumulation of used, discarded,
or worn-out materials or manufactured products, any of which may or may not be
reusable or saleable.
      5.   Parking generated by the conduct of the home occupation shall be
provided off-street and in conformance with this zoning ordinance. The
conducting of the home occupation shall in no way result in the parking of any
motorized vehicle, other than those owned and registered in the name of the
residents, either upon the lot upon which the home occupation is conducted, or
the adjoining public or private street, overnight or longer.
      6.   The home occupation shall comply with the requirements of the
general performance standards of
Chapter 2. In no case shall any equipment or process be used which creates
visual or audible interference in any radio or television receiver located off
the lot on which such home occupation is conducted, or which causes fluctuation
in line voltage beyond the property line of the lot upon which the home
occupation is conducted.
      7.   The use of any tool or equipment powered by electricity, gasoline or
diesel engine, or high pressure gas shall not be used before 7:00 a.m. or after
7:00 p.m. of any day.
      8.   Permitted home occupations shall be limited to those occupations
conducted entirely by mail or telephone, those occupations in which the offered
goods or services are delivered directly to a location other than the property
where the home occupation is located, or those occupations where items are
picked up from the customer at a location other than the property where the
home occupation is located, the work performed, and then returned to the
customer at the customer's location.
         Note: Home occupations requiring customer visits to the location of
the home occupation for the purpose of receiving the goods or services offered
may be permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a special exception.
      9.   Persons who are not residents of the dwelling where the home
occupation is being conducted, and who are engaged either as employees,
subcontractors, independent contractors, or otherwise in the home occupation,
shall not exceed one.
      10.   Signage: Non-illuminated home occupation wall sign not exceeding
two square feet wall-mounted on the dwelling; and, if allowed with the special
exception, one non-illuminated yard sign not exceeding six square feet in size
per face. Other restrictions may apply. See
Chapter 11, Signs.
   B.   Home occupation permits: No building or structure or part thereof shall
hereafter be used for the purposes of a home occupation without first having
applied in writing to the Plan Commission's designated Administrator for a home
occupation permit to do so, and the required permit is issued. Blank forms
shall be provided by the Administrator for the use of those who apply for a
home occupation permit as required by this ordinance.
      Note: In those instances where a special exception is required, the home
occupation permit shall not be issued until after the special exception has
been granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   C.   Home occupations permits nontransferable: All home occupation permits
shall be approved for the originating applicant for a specific location, and
may not be transferred to any other location by that applicant. Should the
property upon which the home occupation is conducted be sold or conveyed to a
different ownership or resident, a renewal of the home occupation permit will
be required.
   D.   Revocation of home occupation permit: Upon a finding that an approved
home occupation permit has become unsuitable or incompatible with the
residential nature of the property or neighborhood where it is located through
noncompliance with any of the requirements of this ordinance, the Board of
Zoning Appeals reserves full authority to revoke the home occupation permit.
The Board, or its designee, shall notify the property owner that such an action
is imminent, that the property owner will have 35 days in which to prepare a
response to the violations specified in the letter-of-intent to revoke the home
occupation permit, and that the Board shall schedule the matter for a public
hearing at the next available regular meeting date following the 35-day notice
period, at which time, all interested citizens will be given the opportunity to
be heard. Said notice to the property owner of the intent to revoke the home
occupation permit shall be delivered by either the United States mail or
through personal service. The public hearing shall be advertised in accordance
with state law and the rules and procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

§ 156.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction by:
minimizing increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to
reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion; minimizing increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
minimizing the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and reducing
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety. The city has produced a Stormwater Development Manual
as a guide to meet the purpose stated above.

(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.08 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All sites shall develop a stormwater pollution prevention plan. The
plan must include: a description of potential pollutant sources from the
proposed land use, that may reasonably be expected to add a significant amount
of pollutants to stormwater discharge; location, dimensions, detailed
specifications, and construction details of all post construction stormwater
quality measures; a description of measures that will be installed to control
pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction
activities have been completed; a sequence describing when each post
construction stormwater quality measure will be installed; and a narrative
description of the maintenance guidelines for all post construction stormwater
quality measures to facilitate their proper long term function.
   (B)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize swales and natural depressions as site conditions allow,
utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater
runoff generated from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (C)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the city. In no case shall the impact on functional values
be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).
   (D)   All sites shall preserve buffer strips and riparian zones, create
filter strips, minimize land disturbance, minimize surface imperviousness,
minimize directly connected impervious areas, maximize open space, direct
growth away from sensitive areas and toward areas that can support it without
compromising water quality, have storage, have infiltration, in any
combination, where appropriate to reduce the impact of pollutants in stormwater
runoff on receiving waters.
   (E)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas.
   (F)   Discharges from an MS4 area will not be allowed directly into
sinkholes or fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge
meeting Indiana ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
   (G)   Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must ensure
that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground water quality
standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
   (H)   As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through the
MS4 conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream bank
erosion. Where necessary, channel protection shall be provided to protect
stream channels from degradation.
   (I)   As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of appropriate
width shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches.
   (J)   New retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal, or
institutional refueling areas, or outlets and refueling areas that replace
their existing tank systems shall be required to design and install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff.
   (K)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., wellhead protection areas, cold water fisheries, shellfish beds,
swimming beaches, recreational waters, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs)
may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or
restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   (L)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan in accordance with 327 IAC 15-6, and shall
file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution
prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (M)   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural stormwater treatment practices and pollution prevention
practices.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.09 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a
stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site shall execute a maintenance agreement, that can
be found in the Columbia City Stormwater Development Manual, and shall be
binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management
facility. The agreement shall provide an easement for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or their contractor or
agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that
the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards
and any other provisions established by this chapter. The maintenance agreement
shall be recorded by the city in the land records.
   (B)   Maintenance agreement. Maintenance of all stormwater management
facilities shall be ensured through the creation of the maintenance agreement.
For residential and non-residential subdivisions, a stormwater provision shall
be included in the subdivision covenants that shall be approved by the city
prior to final plat approval, and recorded into the land record prior to final
plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed by the
owner with the city's approval for when and how often maintenance will occur to
ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant
shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance
of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
   (C)   Requirements for maintenance agreement. All stormwater management
facilities shall undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document
maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of
this chapter and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include:
removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found shall be addressed in a
timely manner, as determined by the city, and the inspection and maintenance
requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning
of the stormwater management facility.
   (D)   Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses
to meet the requirements of the maintenance agreement, the city, after
reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or
maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in
proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility
becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the
party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in
writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have three
days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner.
After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the
cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien
on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and
may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the county.

I.C. 36-1-4-11 and I.C. 36-1-6-2.
   (B)   Post construction inspection.
      (1)   Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations;
inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical
sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges
of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water
or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and joint
inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws.
Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and
repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material
or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of
drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices.
      (2)   Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all
operational activities. This "cease and desist order" will be in effect until
the city confirms that the operational activity is in compliance and the
violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of
violation in a timely manner can result in civil or monetary penalties in
accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter.
   (C)   Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the city the right to enter
the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of
inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a
reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring or
has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or
correction of a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.12 PROPER CREDENTIAL OR IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   The city shall present proper credentials or identification before entering
upon the property of the person.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.13 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Stop work order.
      (1)   The city shall post a stop work order if:
         (a)   Any land-disturbing activity regulated under this chapter is
being undertaken without a permit;
         (b)   The post construction stormwater plan is not being implemented
in good faith; or
         (c)   The conditions of the permit are not being met.
      (2)   Upon appeal to the city's Board of Public Works, a stop work order
or the revocation may be retracted.
      (3)   Ten days after posting a stop work order, the city may issue a
notice of intent to the violator stating that 14 days after issuing the notice
of intent the city may use the surety bond or impose civil penalties to perform
the work necessary to provide compliance with this chapter.
      (4)   If, within five days after notification, a permit holder does not
comply with the erosion and sediment control plan or permit conditions, the
city shall revoke the permit.
      (5)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter are
subject to a forfeiture or fine of not more than $2,500 and the costs of
prosecution for each violation. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a
separate offense.
      (6)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter also may be enforced
by injunction.
   (B)   Cease and desist orders. When the city finds that a person has
violated, or continues to violate, or that the person's past violations are
likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the person directing it to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the person to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (3)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.14 PROJECT TERMINATION.
   An orderly and timely termination of a project with land-disturbing
activities should be planned between all persons involved with a site.
   (A)   Prior to final land grading, seeding, and mulching, the person holding
the permit should petition the city, in writing, to obtain or allow the
installation of any remaining utility lines on the site. Those persons involved
in the installation of utility lines shall perform their work promptly to
minimize the time period during which some of the land may be left in a
relatively unprotected state. After the utility lines have been installed, the
person holding the permit shall promptly complete all stormwater management
activities.
   (B)   When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit shall
petition, in writing, the city for approval of stormwater management measures
which are to remain on the site to evaluate the adequacy of these control
measures. The person with local approval shall submit "as built" drawings with
their petition. If "as built" drawings are not submitted with the petition, the
petition will not be accepted.
      (1)   If the stormwater management measures are approved, any surety
bonds and/or letters of credit shall be released forthrightly. However,
maintenance responsibilities (See §
156.09) shall remain with the person owning the land.
      (2)   If the stormwater management measures are not approved because they
are not in line with either the stormwater pollution prevention plan or the
general principles of this chapter, the city shall notify, in writing, the
person holding the permit of unacceptable features. After a minimum period of
two weeks during which corrective measures are taken, a petition, again in
writing, may be sent asking the city to evaluate the adequacy of the stormwater
management measures. If, in good faith, the city again decides that the
stormwater management measures are inadequate, the city may delay the release
of any surety bonds and/or letters of credit for up to two months. After an
agreed upon time period of two months or longer has lapsed without corrective
measures being taken, the city may use the surety bonds to finance changes or
additions to the stormwater management measures needed to complete the project.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.15 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the enforcement process and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of the
chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and
deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
(Ord. 2005-30, passed 8-23-2005)
§ 156.16 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the city finds that a person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an NPDES permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other standard or requirement, the city may petition
through any court of general jurisdiction within Whitley County, for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction. The city may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the person to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a person.
   (B)   Civil penalties. In addition to the administrative fines available
herein, a person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other standard or requirement
shall also be liable to the city for total civil penalty fines of $2,500 per
violation, per day. Penalties and fines shall accrue for each day during the
period of the violation.
   (C)   The city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
   (D)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the person's violation,
corrective actions by the person, the compliance history of the person, and any
other factor as justice requires.
