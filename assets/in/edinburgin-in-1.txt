   (P)   The provisions of IC 36-8-5-3, et seq., apply to leaves of absence for

Retirement Fund ("PERF") or it may participate in the 1977 fund. The town will
take the appropriate measures for its firefighters to participate in the PERF.
   (R)   Attendance and punctuality. Firefighters shall report at their
scheduled shift start time. If the firefighter is unable to report for the
shift on time or it is necessary to call off regarding the shift, the
firefighter shall call the on-duty officer in charge to report the absence or
that the Firefighter will be arriving late. After doing so, the firefighter
shall log into Fire Manager system and submit a request for time off. The on-
duty officer in charge will be responsible for relaying this information to the
officer in charge of the shift or the Fire Chief, and will attempt to fill the
hours in the event a reported absence adversely affects staffing. Excessive
absenteeism may result in the inability to be assigned to a dedicated shift or
submit hours on the shift schedule. Excessive absenteeism may also result in
disciplinary action.
   (S)   Reserve firefighter request for time off.
      (1)   Reserve firefighters of the Department who are scheduled for a
shift or assigned to a dedicated shift may request approval for time off with
advanced notice to the officer in charge of the shift or the Fire Chief.
      (2)   In the event requested time off will adversely affect the daily
staffing, the reserve firefighter must asked to trade the hours or attempt to
give them away.
   (T)   Regular pay and overtime.
      (1)   Overtime will be paid to members of the Fire Department who are
firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, rescue workers, ambulance personnel, hazardous
material workers and reserve firefighters who have worked over 212 hours during
the Fire Department's 28-day work period.
      (2)   Other employees of the Fire Department, such as dispatchers, alarm
operators, equipment repair, maintenance workers, and others who are not
employees in fire protection activities as defined by 29 C.F.R.553.210(a) will
be paid overtime when they have worked more than 40 hours in a workweek.
      (3)   Overtime compensation is paid to all non-exempt employees at the
rate outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act.
      (4)   Firefighters and reserve firefighters must receive authorization
from the Fire Chief or his designee prior to working unscheduled overtime. It
is the employee's responsibility to record and verify regular hours and
overtime hours on their time sheet.
      (5)   Overtime compensation will be compensated to employees at a rate
of:
         (a)   One and a half times the regular rate of pay for each hour of
overtime work (overtime pay); or
         (b)   One and one-half hours of compensatory time for each hour of
overtime work.
      (6)   Each employee has the option of receiving either overtime pay or
compensatory time off for their overtime hours worked. Employees must inform
the Fire Chief as to whether they want to receive overtime pay or compensatory
time off.
      (7)   The Fire Department retains the option to pay overtime in
additional salary in lieu of providing compensatory time off in any workweek or
work period. This substitution will not affect subsequent granting of
compensatory time off in future workweeks or work periods.
      (8)   Overtime pay will be paid along with regular pay on the employee's
paycheck. Compensatory time off will be placed in a compensatory time bank.
Employees may not accrue more than 24 hours of compensatory time.
      (9)   Payments for unused compensatory time may be made at any time and
shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the
employee receives such payment.
      (10)   Employees may request to use their compensatory time off. They
will be permitted to use the time off within a reasonable period after making
the request if the use does not unduly disrupt the operations of the Fire
Department.
      (11)   Upon termination of employment, the employee will be paid for
unused compensatory time at a rate not less than:
         (a)   The average regular rate received by the employee during the
last three years of employment; or
         (b)   The final regular rate received by the employee, whichever is
higher.
   (U)   Kelly Day (full time employees only).
      (1)   All full-time firefighters of the Fire Department will receive a
Kelly Day (assigned leave day) in order to partially reduce the Fair Labor
Standards Act overtime impact on the town. Kelly Days will be credited as a
leave time bank thus not to affect the employee's hourly pay rate calculations.
The employee will receive a Kelly Day during any 28-day period that the
employee is scheduled to work ten shifts.
      (2)   At times, the employee may be asked to work their Kelly Day at the
discretion of the Fire Chief in order to avoid critical staffing shortages.
Additionally, the town reserves the right to cancel or reschedule an employee's
Kelly Day during a particular 28 day work period as needed to maintain adequate
staffing levels.
   (V)   Pay schedule. Employees are paid on a weekly basis on Thursday. The
pay cycle starts on Monday and includes all hours worked through Sunday.
Employees will receive all earnings the week following the close of the weekly
payroll cycle. Any overtime earnings will be paid the first payroll date
following the completion of the 28-day Fair Labor Standards Act period.
   (W)   Time keeping rules for non-exempt employees.
      (1)   The town will maintain strict compliance with the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
      (2)   Employees must keep accurate record of all of their work hours in
the manner designated by the town (e.g., scheduling and verifying hours,
submitting signed timecards in Fire Manager). Employees must review the
accuracy of the time records before submitting them to the applicable
supervisor for processing.
      (3)   Employees are responsible for reporting accurate time records and
verifying the exact time of the beginning and end of the shift.
      (4)   Employees must obtain their supervisor's approval before working
over and above their regularly scheduled work hours. However, employees are not
required to obtain prior approval when handling emergency situations and runs
that last longer than their scheduled shift.
      (5)   In the event an employee is unable to physically sign their time
sheet, the employee's supervisor may do so with the employee's consent.

provide the best degree of treatment of wastewater consistent with
technological feasibility and economic reasonableness. To determine what kind
of treatment is the "best degree of treatment" within the meaning of this
division, a person shall consider the following:
         (a)   What degree of waste reduction can be achieved by process
change, improved housekeeping, and recovery of individual waste components for
reuse; or
         (b)   Whether individual process wastewater streams should be
segregated or combined.
      (2)   Measurement of contaminant concentrations to determine compliance
with the effluent standards set forth herein shall be made at the point of
discharge to the town's sewage works.
   (D)   Background concentrations. Because the effluent standards set forth
herein are based upon concentrations achievable with conventional treatment
technology that is largely unaffected by ordinary levels of contaminants in
intake water, they are absolute standards that must be met without subtracting
background concentrations. However, it is not the intent of these regulations
to require users to clean up contaminations caused essentially by upstream
sources or to require treatment when only traces of contaminants are added to
the background. Compliance with the numerical effluent standards is therefore
not required when effluent concentrations in excess of the standards result
entirely from influent contamination, evaporation, and/or the incidental
addition of traces of materials not utilized or produced in the activity that
is the source of the waste.
   (E)   Sampling. Any person subject to reporting requirements of this chapter
shall submit the results of the sampling and analysis in accordance with 40 CFR
403.12 (b)(5). Except as otherwise specifically provided, compliance with the
numerical standards set forth herein shall be determined on the basis of 24-
hour composite samples. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the Superintendent and IDEM within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent
and IDEM within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not
required to resample if the Superintendent and IDEM monitors at the user's
facility at least once per month, or if the Superintendent and IDEM samples
between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling.

§ 50.39 CERTAIN DISCHARGES TO BE APPROVED.
   If any sewage is discharged, or proposed to be discharged to the sewage
works which contains the substances or possesses the characteristics enumerated
in §§ 50.31 through 50.39, and which in the judgment of the town or
Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment
works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the town may in writing, reject
the waters, require pretreatment to an acceptable condition prior to discharge
to the sanitary sewers, require flow equalization of the rate of discharge, or
require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not
covered by the existing sewer service charges. If the town permits the
pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, plans and specifications shall be
submitted to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) for
review and approval. Such plans and specifications shall also be subject to
review and approval by the town, before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and specifications will in no way relive that person from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the town, under the provisions of this subchapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the town.

§ 50.58 CERTAIN RATES MODIFIED DUE TO STRENGTH, CHARACTER OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In order that the fees and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the town shall base its charges not only on
the volume, but also on the strength and character of the sewage and wastes
which it is required to treat and dispose of. The town shall require the owner
or other user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes
discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in
a manner and by the method as the town may deem practicable in the light of the
conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the
proper charge. The owner or other user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the town at all times.
   (B)   Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes
shall be made on the following basis, with Phase I being implemented July 1,
2015, and Phase II being implemented on July 1, 2016:
      (1)   Fee surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.30 (for Phase I and Phase II) per 1,000 gallons of flow
for each 100 milligrams, or fraction thereof, of suspended solids in excess of
200 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Fee surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $0.30 (for Phase I and Phase II) per 1,000 gallons of flow for each 100
milligrams, or fraction thereof, of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 200
milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Fee surcharge based upon ammonia-as-nitrogen. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.81 (for Phase I and Phase II) per 1,000 gallons of flow
for each ten milligrams, or fraction thereof, of ammonia-as-nitrogen in excess
of 30 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (4)   Fee surcharge based upon total phosphorus. There shall be an
additional surcharge of $0.12 per 1,000 gallons of flow for each four
milligrams, or fraction thereof, of total phosphorus in excess of eight
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (C)   To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and
analysis shall be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the
town.
   (D)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,"
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation.

§ 50.59 SPRINKLING LAWNS.
   (A)   In order that domestic and residential users of sewage services shall
not be penalized for the sprinkling of lawns during the
months of July, August, and September, the billing for treatment plant sewage
services for residences and domestic users for the months of July, August, and
September shall be based on the water usage for the previous months of October,
November, and December. In the event the water usage for the previous months of
October, November, and December is greater than the water usage for the months
of July, August, and September, then the billing for sewage service shall be
computed on the actual water used in the month for which the sewage service
bill is rendered.
   (B)   Domestic and residential sewage service, as applicable to the
sprinkling charge, shall not apply to each lot, parcel of real estate, or
building which is occupied and used as a residence. The sprinkling charge shall
not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for industrial or
commercial purposes. In the event a portion of the premises shall be used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of
separating the water service so that the residential portion of the premises is
served through a separate meter. In this case, the water usage registered by
the water meter serving the portion of the premises used for residential
purposes, would qualify under the sprinkling charge.

(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.031 STORM WATER RATE AND FEE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Each parcel of property assigned a separate tax identification number
shall be individually subject to a storm water service charge, unless a parcel
is determined to be exempt from such a charge pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this chapter.
   (B)   For each parcel that directly or indirectly contributes to the storm
water system of the district, the storm water service charge shall be based on
the presence of and/or measure of impervious surface area on the parcel or
property.
   (C)   Each parcel shall be classified as residential property or non-
residential property. The Director is authorized to establish the
classification of an individual parcel or property based upon its primary use.
If, in the opinion of any user, the classification of an individual parcel or
property is incorrect, the individual may appeal using the provisions of §

§ 53.032 RATE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION.
   (A)   For the purposes stated in §§
53.004 and
53.015, there is hereby assessed a storm water service charge to each user in
the district who contributes directly or indirectly to the storm water system
of the district, in an amount defined below.
   (B)   The DSM hereby establishes that an equivalent residential unit (“ERU”)
shall be based upon 3,225 square feet of impervious surface area.
   (C)   All parcels having impervious surface area within the district shall
be assigned an ERU, or multiple thereof, with all properties having impervious
area assigned at least one ERU excepting contiguous residential properties as
defined in this section.
   (D)   The storm water service charge for one ERU is hereby established
according to the Town Fee Schedule. The total service charge for a particular
property shall be determined by taking the number of ERUs assigned to a
particular property and multiplying it by the service charge for one ERU.
   (E)   Residential properties. A monthly flat rate charge for storm water
service rendered to residential properties shall be charged to each account
within the district. All residential properties are assigned one ERU. This flat
fee shall apply to all residential properties as defined herein.
      (1)   Contiguous residential properties having common ownership and
sharing a single structure containing four or less dwelling units may be
assigned a common ERU.
      (2)   Contiguous residential properties having common ownership, one of
which contains a dwelling building, and the remainder of which contain
impervious surface area but serve an accessory or incidental use, may be
assigned a common ERU.
   (F)   Non-residential properties. The impervious surface area of each
nonresidential property shall be individually calculated Non-residential
properties shall be assessed a monthly rate for storm water service based upon
the total number of ERUs that encompasses the measured impervious surface area
on the individual property. The calculation to determine the total number of
ERUs for a non-residential property shall be completed by dividing the total
square footage of measured impervious surface area for a property by 3,225
square feet. The division shall be calculated to the first decimal place. Total
ERUs shall not be less than one for any non-residential property containing
measurable surface area.
   (G)   Only whole ERUs shall be used in determining the assignment of gross
ERUs to a property. All rounding necessary to reach the appropriate whole ERU
shall be done according to mathematical convention (0 - 0.4 rounded down to the
nearest whole ERU; 0.5 - 0.9 rounded up to the nearest whole ERU).
(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)

approximately 15 days after the bill is rendered, shall be subject to a
collection or deferred payment charge of 10% on the outstanding balance.
Payments returned for nonsufficient funds (“NSF”) shall be subject to an NSF
fee of $20.00 plus an amount equal to the actual charge by the depository
institution for negotiable instruments returned for insufficient funds. When an
NSF fee is imposed, the town shall notify the maker or drawer, or the person
for whose benefit the instrument was given, to inform him or her that the
instrument was dishonored or returned unpaid and that the person has ten days
after the date the notice is mailed to pay the total amount due, including the
NSF fee, in cash, certified check, or other guaranteed payment. If the person
fails to make payment within the ten-day period, the town may file a civil
action for the amount due, including the NSF fee, court courts, reasonable
attorneys' fees, and treble damages. If payment is not received with respect to
dishonored checks within 90 days after the check is initially received, the
matter will be referred to the corresponding County Prosecutor in accordance
with IC 36-1-8-13.
   (C)   Payment priority.
      (1)   Partial payments shall be applied in this order:
         (a)   Any NSF fee on the account;

      (3)   Land-disturbing activities where there will be no additional
impervious surfaces associated with the final completed project, including but
not limited to, ditch construction/reconstruction and utility installation/
maintenance activities.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
53.061, those site developments where the storm water management system has
been designed such that:
         (a)   After combining flows from both the off-site and on-site
drainage areas, there will be no increase in the total peak discharge from the
developing site during the two-, ten-, and 100-year storm events; and
         (b)   The volume of runoff for each project site outlet has not been
increased for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events; and
         (c)   The flow width and velocity at the property boundary line of
each sub-basin is less than or equal to that flow width and velocity which
existed prior to the development for the two-, ten-, and 100-year storm events.
(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.061 POLICY ON STORM WATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Detention policy. It is recognized that most streams and drainage
channels serving the town do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
storm water runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, except
for situations provided in §
53.045(C) and (D), the storage and controlled release of excess storm water
runoff shall be required for all developments and redevelopments (as defined in
§
53.075) located within Edinburgh.
   (B)   Floodplain storage policy.
      (1)   Floodplains exist adjacent to all natural and manmade streams,
regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been previously
identified or mapped. Due to potential impacts of floodplain loss of peak flows
in streams and on the environment, disturbance to floodplains should be
avoided. When the avoidance of floodplain disturbance is not practical, the
natural functions of floodplain should be preserved to the extent possible.
      (2)   Compensatory excavation equivalent to the floodplain storage lost
(no net loss) shall be required for all activities within floodplain of streams
located in the town where the drainage area of the stream upstream of the
project is equal or larger than one square mile. This requirement shall be
above and beyond the minimum requirements provided in the applicable flood
hazard areas ordinance currently in effect in the town. The DSM and/or the
permitting officer may alter the compensation ratio, based on extenuating
circumstances, for a specific project.
      (3)   Compensatory storage is the replacement of the existing floodplain
storage lost due to fill. Compensatory storage is required when a portion of
the floodplain is filled or because of a project a change in the channel
hydraulics occurs that reduces the existing available floodplain storage. The
compensatory storage should be located adjacent or opposite the placement of
the fill and maintain an unimpeded connection to an adjoining floodplain area.

(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.076 POLICY ON STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (A)   Effective storm water pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   All permittees shall manage storm water discharges as necessary to
meet the narrative water quality criteria (327 IAC 2-1-6(a)(l)(A-D) and 327 IAC
2-1.5-8(a) and (b)(l)(A-D) for any discharge authorized by this chapter and
CSGP, with compliance required upon beginning such a discharge. For storm water
discharges, the use of storm water management measures and planning principles
is expected to achieve the control necessary to meet water quality criteria.
   (C)   The SWPPP will serve as a guideline for storm water management but
should not be interpreted to be the only basis for implementation of storm
water measures for a project site. The permittee is responsible for
implementing all measures necessary to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and the CSGP.
   (D)   All storm water management measures, including erosion and sediment
control measures and post-construction measures, shall be implemented in
accordance with this chapter, the Standards, the terms and conditions of the
approved storm water management permit, and CSGP.
(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.077 CALCULATIONS, DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this chapter to the project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land-
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must
comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
      (3)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this rule,
the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of
land disturbance for improvements, such as roads, utilities, or common areas,
and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the
following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all storm water pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Storm Water Quality Manual or the Standards. The methods and procedures
included in these two references are in keeping with the above stated policy
and meet the requirements of CSGP.

   (A)   Following approval of the SWPPP by the DSM and commencement of
construction activities, the DSM and/or the permitting officer has the
authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with
this chapter, the Standards, the terms and conditions of the approved storm
water management permit, and CSGP.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program shall be implemented by the project site
owner to ensure the SWPPP is working effectively in accordance with the CSGP.
At a minimum, the self-monitoring program shall meet the requirements in the
Standards.
   (C)   Following the final completion of construction and the receipt of as-
built drawings, the DSM and/or the permitting officer has the authority to
inspect new development and redevelopment sites to verify that all on-site
storm water conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system are in
compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to DSM
and/or the permitting officer, the DSM and/or the permitting officer has the
right to request complete records of maintenance and monitoring activities
involving storm water pollution prevention measures. All evaluation reports for
the project site must be made available to DSM and/or the permitting officer,
in an organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request.

STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 53.085 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   Projects subject to this section are the same per the applicability and
exemption criteria for construction sites described in §
53.060 (A) and (B). Additional exemptions under this section include:
   (A)   Land-disturbing activities where there will be no additional
impervious surfaces associated with the final completed project, including but
not limited to, ditch construction/reconstruction and utility installation/
maintenance activities;
   (B)   Single-family residential strip development offered for sale or lease
without land improvements and the project is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale; and
   (C)   Residential developments consisting of four or fewer lot developments

Impervious is determined by the sum of all infrastructure (roads, paths,
parking, etc.) and the average projects hard surfaces associated with all
building lots within the project.
(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.086 POLICY ON STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Developed areas, as compared to undeveloped areas, generally have
increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates, increased runoff rates,
and increased concentrations of pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides,
greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new development and redevelopment
continues in Edinburgh, measures must be taken to promote runoff volume
reduction, infiltrate storm water into the ground and intercept and filter
pollutants from storm water runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams,
rivers and wetlands. Using BMPs, harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and
contaminants will be reduced in storm water runoff.
   (B)   Storm water quality measures are incorporated as a permanent feature
into construction projects and are left in place following completion of
construction activities to continuously treat storm water runoff from the
stabilized site. The following will be implemented as a minimum:
      (1)   The control of storm water quality will be based on the management
of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The town requires a minimum of 80% removal of
TSS including floatables without resuspension. TSS is defined as particles
smaller than 125 microns in diameter.
      (2)   New retail gasoline outlets and refueling areas or those that
replace their existing tank systems, regardless of size, are required to
install appropriate measures to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons in storm water runoff.
      (3)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas as the primary water quality treatment measure, unless the measure is
designed to treat the pollutant(s) of concern that originate in the drainage
area of the measure.
      (4)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
      (5)   Outfalls must be designed to reduce outfall scouring and bank
erosion.
(Ord. 2023-22, passed 12-28-23)
§ 53.087 CALCULATIONS, DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all storm water quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana Storm Water
Quality Manual or the Standards. The methods and procedures included in these
two references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the
requirements of IDEM's CSGP and MS4GP.
   (B)   A pre-approved list of BMP(s) is specified in the Standards. The noted
BMPs must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines
provided or referenced in the Standards. Practices other than those specified
in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to
whether the performance (minimum 80% TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of
such practices will be according to guidelines provided in the Standards, would
be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for
consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are provide in the Standards.

officer and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter.
   (C)   In considering any such appeal, the DSM may grant a variance from the
terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action
being appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements are
satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided; however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses to comply with the
chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of storm water runoff.

STORM WATER RUNOFF
§ 150.65 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE.
   (A)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water
runoff rates, runoff volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition. This storm water runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants. Storm water runoff, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of storm water runoff from development sites.
   (B)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum storm water
management requirements and controls to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation and to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the town. This
subchapter seeks to meet that purpose through minimizing increases in storm
water runoff rates and volumes, erosion and nonpoint source pollution caused by
storm water runoff, wherever possible, through storm water management controls
and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council hereby adopts the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2007-8, passed 7-23-07; Am. Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-24-14)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2007-8, passed 7-23-07; Am. Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-24-14)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas, by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters, or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2007-8, passed 7-23-07; Am. Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-24-14)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding, and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges,
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-blight
areas.
(Ord. 2007-8, passed 7-23-07; Am. Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-24-14)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage,
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   "A ZONE." Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones Al-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   "ZONE A." Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   "ZONE AE" and "Al-A30." Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations
are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones Al-A30.)
      (3)   "ZONE AO." Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   "ZONE AH." Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding), where average depths are one to
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   "ZONE AR." Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   "ZONE A99." Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special
flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base
flood elevations or depths are shown.
   "ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)." A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure, and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and shall be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   "ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE)." Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   "APPEAL." A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   "AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING." A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), with base flood depths from one to three feet,
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   "BASE FLOOD." The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   "BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)." The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   "BASEMENT." That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   "BOUNDARY RIVER." The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   "BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY." The floodway of a boundary river.
   "BUILDING." See "STRUCTURE".
   "COMMUNITY." A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   "COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS)." A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   "CRITICAL FACILITY." A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   "D ZONE." Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities, but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   "DEVELOPMENT." Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      (4)   Construction of flood control structures, such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      (7)   Storage of materials; or
      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
"DEVELOPMENT" does not include activities for the maintenance of existing
structures and facilities, such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing roads, or
gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation or the construction of permanent structures.
   "ELEVATED STRUCTURE." A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings or columns (posts and piers).
   "ELEVATION CERTIFICATE." A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   "EMERGENCY PROGRAM." The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   "EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   "EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   "FEMA." The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   "FLOOD." A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   "FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)." An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   "FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)." An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   "FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS)." The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   "FLOOD-PRONE AREA." Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See "FLOOD".
   "FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE." The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. See "FREEBOARD".
   "FLOODPLAIN." The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake
or watercourse that have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The "FLOODPLAIN" includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT." The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS." This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power that control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, that provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage. "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS" are
also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage
prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   "FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING)." A method of protecting a structure that
ensures it, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is
watertight to the floodproofed design elevation, with walls that are
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of
these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris-impact forces.
   "FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE." A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   "FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel that are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   "FREEBOARD." A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
that is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   "FRINGE." Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   "HARDSHIP." As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURES." Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   "INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC)." The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   "LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD)." A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process that establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period, unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   "LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC)." A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   "LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA)." An amendment to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property-specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      (2)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR)." An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F)." An official
revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on
fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   "LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE." The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   "LOWEST FLOOR." The lowest of the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure, where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of floodwaters, unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls, by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   "MANUFACTURED HOME." A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
built on a permanent chassis, and designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "MANUFACTURED
HOME" does not include a "RECREATIONAL VEHICLE".
   "MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   "MARKET VALUE." The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between
a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate
market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified
appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value),
or adjusted assessed values.
   "MITIGATION." Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk
to people and property from hazards and their effects.
   The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and
to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.
   "NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP)." The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   "NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929." As corrected in 1929, a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   "NEW CONSTRUCTION." Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   "NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION." A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   "NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY." The floodway of any river or stream other
than a boundary river.
   "NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88)." As adopted in 1993, a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   "OBSTRUCTION." Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse that may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   "ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD." The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See "REGULATORY FLOOD".
   "PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR)." An official republication of a community's
FEMA map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations,
floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric
features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or
improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or
correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
   "PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE." Anything injurious to the safety or health of
an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or
that unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of
any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   "RECREATIONAL VEHICLE." A vehicle that is: (1) built on a single chassis;
(2) 400 square feet or less, when measured at the largest horizontal
projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a
light-duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   "REGULAR PROGRAM." The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available, based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   "REGULATORY FLOOD." The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is
acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any
location is as defined in §152.07. The "REGULATORY FLOOD" is also known by the
terms "BASE FLOOD", "ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD", and 100-year flood.
   "REPETITIVE LOSS." Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairing the
flood damage at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or
exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   "SECTION 1316." That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, that states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for
any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   "SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS (SFHAs)." Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the Town
of Edinburgh are generally identified as such on the Bartholomew County,
Indiana, and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated December 9, 2014, as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date; the Johnson County, Indiana, and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, dated August 2, 2007, as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date; the Shelby County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
dated November 5, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, Al-A30,
AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
   "START OF CONSTRUCTION." Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement,
the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   "STRUCTURE." A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes a
recreational vehicle to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   "SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE." Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   "SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT." Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements, or any
alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
   "SUSPENSION." The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
it has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations
required for participation in the NFIP.
   "VARIANCE." A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter, where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   "VIOLATION." The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
"WATERCOURSE" includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   "X ZONE." The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   "ZONE." A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.
   "ZONE A." See definition for "A ZONE".
   "ZONE B, C, AND X." Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate
or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

§ 152.34 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §152.07, are areas designated as
floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and have erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under
the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities,
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before
the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude
non-substantial additions/ improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a
non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-
substantial additions/improvements to residences in a non-boundary river
floodway, without obtaining a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that, if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, granting approval for construction in
a floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
this subchapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed that, acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, will adversely affect the efficiency of,
or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined
as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a
foot, as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the
project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven
with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per the mapping standard
regulations found in 44 CFR §55.12.

§152.99
§ 152.35 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure
shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2007-8, passed 7-23-07; Am. Ord. 2014-17, passed 11-24-14)
§ 152.36 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment, citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation, and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions
contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and the 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot, and will not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.

§ 152.48 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary

or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §152.34
or §152.36(A) may be granted.
   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §152.34 or §152.36(A)
will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (D)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §152.31 may
be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre
or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built, and stating that the cost
of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See §
152.49).
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See §152.49).

floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade, shall be
given written notice, over the signature of a community official, that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder, and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Official Thoroughfare
Plan, a Section of the Master Plan of Edinburgh, Indiana, 1967."
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)
§ 155.02 OFFICIAL MAPS.
   The official thoroughfare plan of the town is shown on two maps, entitled
"Comprehensive Development Plan, Edinburgh, Indiana, dated 1967," with a sub-
title: "Major Street and Highway Plan, Sheet 1 of 2 and Sheet 2 of 2." These
maps show the locations of existing and proposed thoroughfares of various types
and widths within the town and areas within the jurisdiction of the Town Plan
Commission. Notations, references, indications, and other details shown on the
official thoroughfare plan maps are as much a part of this chapter as if they
were fully described in the text of this chapter.
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)
§ 155.03 DRAWING OF THOROUGHFARE CROSS-SECTION INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE.
   A drawing entitled "Typical Thoroughfare Cross-Section, Edinburgh, Indiana",
which shows cross-sections for streets as designated on the official
thoroughfare plan maps, is hereby declared to be a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)
§ 155.04 CLASSIFICATION OF THOROUGHFARES.
   The thoroughfares are classified as to width and type in accordance with
their function as a part of the thoroughfare plan system, and are designated as
arterial, feeder, parkway, and residential streets as shown on the official
thoroughfare plan maps. Such streets are to be provided with the right-of-way
widths, shown on the official thoroughfare plan as set out in §§155.05 through
155.07, and §§155.20 and 155.21 of this chapter. They are to be improved as
required by the effective subdivision control regulations (Chapter 154) of the
town.
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)   Penalty, see §10.99
§ 155.05 OPENING, WIDENING OF STREETS.
   Whenever a street designated on the official thoroughfare plan is to be
platted as a part of a subdivision of land, the right-of-way shall conform to
the policies and specified designations and indications in the official
thoroughfare plan. However, where a street borders a tract of land to be
subdivided, the owner of that land shall be required to plat only one-half of
the right-of-way width designated for that street, measured at 90° to the
center line thereof.
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)   Penalty, see §10.99
§ 155.06 LOCATION OF STREETS TO CONFORM TO THOROUGHFARE PLAN.
   (A)   Whenever the locations of streets are indicated on the official
thoroughfare plan as following existing roads or streets, or as following
section or half-section lines or other established property lines, they shall
conform to such locations. However, streets lying wholly within a subdivision,
and not designated as following an existing road or a section line, may be
varied in their alignment when such variance promotes the plan of a
neighborhood development and provides for the continuity of traffic movements.
   (B)   Streets which follow irregular alignment, or indicate revised
alignments, or are not referenced to established lines, shall follow in a
general manner the alignment shown on the official thoroughfare plan. Their
alignment shall be subject to detailed surveys which may be made by the town,
the Town Plan Commission, by other public agencies, or by the owners of land to
be subdivided. Such surveys shall be subject to the approval of the Town Plan
Commission prior to the acquisition of land or the filing of subdivision plans
affecting such streets.
(Ord. 1967-12, passed 9-5-67)   Penalty, see §10.99
§ 155.07 STREET RIGHTS-OF-WAY TO BE PROTECTED FROM ENCROACHMENT.
   In the case of permits authorized by the Town Board of Trustees for the
erection or alteration of structures and other improvements, the permit shall
be issued only if the proposed street and thoroughfare rights-of-way, as set
forth by this chapter, will be protected from encroachment. For planning and
zoning purposes, the proposed street and thoroughfare right-of-way lines will
be considered as the front line of lots and tracts bordering such streets and
thoroughfares.

street improvement purposes to participate with the owners of land abutting
streets within the town in the improvement of such streets, in accordance with
the requirements of the Town Board of Trustees and the "standards for street
improvement" established in §154.52 of the subdivision code.
   (B)   For any participation project, the Board shall be governed by the
following policies:
      (1)   All alley and street intersections will be paved at town expense.
The cost of such work is not to be considered as a part of the town's share of
other street improvements.
      (2)   The cost of grading and excavating in connection with the
improvement of alleys and streets existing at the time of the passage of this
chapter is to be considered a town expense and not as a part of the town's
share of other street and alley improvements.
      (3)   The cost of grading and excavating in connection with the
improvement of streets and alleys hereafter dedicated is not to be considered a
part of the improvement cost in which the town can participate.
      (4)   The town may participate to the extent of 50% of the cost of
improving an alley located in a business district, as shown in the Town Zone
Map. The town shall not participate in the cost of improving alleys other than
those indicated above.
      (5)   The amount of the participation of the town in the cost of street
improvements is indicated below as a percentage of the total of such cost, as
may be modified by preceding statements, in accordance with the street
designation and width of surface to be improved. This may include curb and
gutter of the integral ro11-type where that type of curb may be installed.

   (B)   The Town Board of Trustees, in the carrying out of any project under
the official thoroughfare plan adopted by this chapter, shall consider and
determine what proportionate part of the cost of the project or of any separate
phase of improvement thereunder, shall be paid by the town out of the
Thoroughfare Fund, including any increase of damages ordered by any court on
appeal, as benefit the town at large. At that time, the Board shall determine
the amount, if any, of the total cost of such a phase or improvement under the
project, including damages awarded by the Board, which shall be assessed as
benefits upon the real estate within a special benefit district.
      (1)   In the event the cost of acquisition and the benefits assessed
against the town by reason of such a project shall, at any time, be in excess
of the amount of money then standing to the credit of the Thoroughfare Fund of
the town, the town shall have the power, and the Town Board is hereby
authorized by ordinance, to issue a bond in a sum sufficient to pay for the
benefit, or any part thereof, as deemed necessary. These shall be issued and
sold in the same form and manner, and with the same rate of interest and with
such maturities, as are by law provided for the issuance and sale of bonds of
the town for the general purposes thereof.
      (2)   The proceeds of the sale of such bonds shall be deposited in, and
credited to the Thoroughfare Fund, to be used in the payment for the cost of
acquisition, the benefits assessed against the town at large, and any increased
damages which may be ordered paid by any court on appeal.
