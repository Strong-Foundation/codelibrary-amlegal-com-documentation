(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)

representatives of the Commission while such persons are carrying out the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.156 REMOVAL.
   (A)   The Commission may remove, prune or cause to be removed and pruned,
all trees, shrubs, or any other plants that are planted on the public right-of-
way or municipal property, when it is determined the pruning or removal will be
beneficial to the peace, health, and safety of the public and public
improvements or where trees, shrubs, or plants are detrimental to the growth of
adjacent trees.
   (B)   Permission must be obtained before removing any street tree. Such
permission must be obtained from the Tree Commission.
   (C)   Any tree removed from the public right-of-way or municipal property,
must be cut low to the ground within four inches of ground level and no brush,
limbs, or other parts of the tree are to be allowed to remain in any city
street overnight. All stumps of street or park trees shall be removed below the
surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the
surface of the ground. The stump area shall be cleaned up and backfilled with
appropriate dirt and re-seeded back to grass.
   (D)   The Street Commissioner has the right to remove a street tree, or part
of a street tree, that the Street Commissioner determines is hazardous. Unless
an emergency exists, the Street Commissioner shall notify the Commission of his
decision and seek the input of the Commission in advance of removal of a street
tree or part of a street tree. The Street Commissioner or his designee shall
report in writing to the Commission the following month the removal of all
street trees or parts of street trees that the Street Commissioner determined
were hazardous.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.157 LOCATION OF TREES ALONG THE STREET.
   (A)   On streets with a narrow planting strip between the sidewalk and curb,
consideration should be given to planting trees on private property inside the
sidewalk.
   (B)   Where there is a planting strip of at least three feet, trees can be
grown satisfactorily on the city-owned property between the sidewalk and curb.
The Commission shall determine the kinds of trees that should be planted,
taking into consideration the space available.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.158 PERMISSION TO PLANT.
   (A)   Permission must be obtained before planting any tree or shrub in the
planting strip between sidewalk and curb. This permission to plant is granted
by the Commission. The goal of this restriction is to reduce overhead line
clearance and tree removal costs, and lessen potential highway hazards by
reducing interference with street lighting and the danger of falling limbs and
trees. The Commission is authorized to refuse the granting of permission when
the planting is likely to create a public danger or nuisance or be detrimental
to the growth of adjacent trees. The purpose of this permission to plant is to
insure the planting of appropriate types of trees and proper spacing along the
streets.
   (B)   No permission is needed to plant trees on private property inside the
sidewalk. It is suggested, however, that the property owner use trees such as
those mentioned in this subchapter as being desirable and take into
consideration the space available for tree growth.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.159 PLANTING AND CARE.
   (A)   In general it will be more satisfactory to engage a nurseryman,
arborist, or someone familiar with tree care to do the planting. If the
property owner does the planting, he or she should familiarize himself or
herself with the requirements for successfully transplanting trees. Property
owners should follow the planting guidelines found in the publication of the
Commission called "Rising Sun, Indiana Tree Guide."
   (B)   All materials to be planted shall be of nursery stock.
   (C)   Proper watering is extremely important for trees the first two years
following transplanting. During dry periods, add enough water to soak the soil
to root depth once a week. Transplanted trees can be over watered. If the soil
is heavy and drains poorly the trees can be injured by too much water as well
as too little. Instructions for watering can be found in "Rising Sun, Indiana
Street Tree Guide" and in the Street Tree leaflet. Bark or cypress mulch
applied to the soil around the tree will help conserve moisture.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.160 SPACING OF STREET TREES.
   (A)   The spacing of shade trees classified as small or medium or large in
the list of acceptable trees in "Approved Street Trees for Rising Sun" shall be
established by the mature height of the street tree and in no instance shall be
less than that of the anticipated mature height of the desired street tree or
street trees. Large street trees can be spaced a minimum of 50 feet apart,
medium street trees 45 feet apart and small street trees 40 feet apart.
   (B)   No trees shall be planted within ten feet of a fire hydrant.
   (C)   No tree shall be planted within three feet of a curb cut.
   (D)   The clearance from existing features such as utility poles, existing
trees, or alley lines shall be maintained at one-half the anticipated mature
height of the tree.
   (E)   No tree shall be planted within 30 feet of a curb defining an
intersection of streets or the edge of the pavement at an intersection of
streets where there is no curb
   (F)   Areas which are unique for purposes of tree planting should be
addressed to the Commission for study and recommendation.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)
§ 32.161 PROTECTION OF TREES.
   (A)   No person shall molest, deface, destroy, any street tree or part
thereof, or injure any street tree, shrub, or plant on public right-of-ways or
municipal property, nor shall any person permit any chemical, either solid or
fluid to seep, drain, or be emptied on or about any street tree, shrub, or
plant that is now or thereafter, growing on a public right-of-way or municipal
property. Owners of property immediately adjacent to a public right-of- way, or
insured arborists hired by them, members of the Rising Sun tree crews, members
of the Rising Sun Tree Commission or workers or crews under their supervision,
and Rising Sun Municipal Utilities in their work functions may properly prune
(as defined by the National Arbor Association) a street tree; provided, the
adjacent property owners shall be limited to pruning at a height not to exceed
ten feet.
   (B)   No person shall fasten to a street tree or shrub, for the purpose of
anchorage, any wire, rope, chain, or cables. No person shall nail, tie, or in
any other manner fasten any cords, signs, posters, boards, or any other
particle to any street tree, shrub, or plant that is now or may hereafter be
growing on any right-of-way or municipal property. The only exception to this
rule will be the first year staking of newly planted trees.

cyclists and obstructing the view of traffic signs or signals. The minimum

portion of streets and alleys.
(Ord. 2007-1, passed 6-7-07)

behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the city will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.

encouraged to volunteer to participate in an approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the employee and family assistance program, before work

barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this subchapter or any other city policies or job requirements.
   (D)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.

of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline).

reasonably indicative of substance abuse.
      (2)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation
program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the city.
      (3)   When required by law.
   (C)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/or
job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor (with
the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
city. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
   (D)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the city. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.

asset loan project by other lenders and investors, the term of the loan may be

Appendix A, attached to Ordinance No. 1996-10, passed May 2, 1996.
(Ord. 1996-10, passed 5-2-96)
Editor's note:
   This ordinance is effective upon passage provided that the Peak Management
Credit described therein shall not become effective unless approved by the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
§ 50.04 INTERRUPTIBLE SERVICE TARIFF.
   (A)   Applicability. Interruptible service is available to any retail
customer capable of meeting the terms and conditions listed below. The retail
customer shall enter into a contract with the Indiana Municipal Power Agency
(IMPA) and the municipal utilities for an interruptible load of at least 500
kW. The customer shall be billed according to the terms and conditions of the
applicable retail service schedule and this section shall be applied as a
credit to the bill determined under that schedule.
   (B)   Terms and conditions of service.
      (1)   The customer shall enter into a contract with IMPA and the utility
for a specific amount of firm load and an additional amount of interruptible
load greater than or equal to 500 kW.
      (2)   IMPA reserves the right to request interruption of the customer's
interruptible load at any time at its own discretion subject to the limitations
listed below.
      (3)   The number of interruptions shall not exceed one per day, and the
total hours of interruption shall not exceed eight hours per occurrence or 250
hours per year.
      (4)   IMPA and/or the utility will attempt to provide as much notice as
possible of pending interruptions, however, the customer shall interrupt
service within 30 minutes if requested to do so.
      (5)   The customer shall enter into a contract with IMPA and the utility
specifying the firm load, the interruptible load and the terms and conditions
of service. The initial contract shall be for a term of three years.
      (6)   Neither IMPA nor the utility are responsible for any loss or damage
to the customer's products or equipment as a result of an interruption under
this schedule.
   (C)   Monthly capacity credit.
      (1)   During months when the customer's interruptible load is interrupted
during the hour of the utility's billing demand, IMPA will credit to the
utility and the utility will credit to the customer an amount equal to $2.50
per kW times the interruptile billing demand. The interruptible billing demand
is the four hour average of the customer's 60 minute demands prior to the hour
of interruption minus the greater of the customer's contracted firm load or the
customer's actual metered load during the hour of the utility's billing demand.
      (2)   During months when there is no interruption during the hour of the
utility's billing demand, IMPA will credit to the utility and the utility will
credit to the customer an amount equal to $2.50 per kW times the customer's 60
minute demand minus the customer's contracted firm load during the hour of the
utility's billing demand.
   (D)   Failure to fully interrupt.
      (1)   During any month, if the customer fails to reduce its total load to
no more than its contracted firm load plus 10% of its contracted interruptible
load when requested to do so, the customer will incur a penalty for such
failure. Such penalty will be in addition to the regular charges payable under
the utility's applicable rate schedule.
      (2)   The penalty will be an additional fee per kW applicable to the
customer's metered kW during the hour of the utility's billing demand less the
sum of the customer's contracted firm load and 10% of the customer's contracted
interruptible load. During any 12 consecutive months, this additional fee will
be $2.50 per kW for the first month, $5.00 per kW for the second month and $15
per kW for all subsequent months of such failure to interrupt. This additional
fee will be billed by IMPA to the utility and by the utility to the customer.
   (E)   Request for/acknowledgment of interruption. Requests for interruption
and permission to terminate interruption will be made, at IMPA's option, by
telephone or by electronic signal at the customer's premises. Specific
procedures for requests for interruptions and acknowledgment of such requests
shall be included in the customer's contract with IMPA and the utility.
   (F)   Metering. The customer will provide space, facilities and cost
reimbursement to the utility for a utility-provided recording demand meter to
measure the customer's 60 minute integrated demand. IMPA and the utility shall
have the right to obtain meter readings and inspect and test meters at all
times.
   (G)   Other. All other provisions of the utility's applicable retail rate
schedule apply to this section.

current obligations, including those for operating expenses, sinking funds,
bond and interest retirement funds, or any other priority fund requirement
fixed by ordinance or law. Such surplus earnings shall be paid into the cash
reserve fund and carried on the books of the utilities as such.
   (C)   Funds in the cash reserve fund may be used for maintenance, repairs,
and future planning of the utility. Funds in cash reserve may also be used to
make loans to another utility owned by the same municipality, for periods not
to exceed five years, at any interest rate. The repayment of the loans and
interest shall be returned to the cash reserve fund.

INTERCONNECTION STANDARDS
§ 50.20 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City of Rising Sun of, Indiana owns and operates its own electric
utility under the supervision and control of the Board under I.C. 8-1.5-3-4;
   (B)   The City of Rising Sun desires to encourage the development of
renewable energy resources, such as solar or wind, and to promote the wise use
of Indiana's natural energy resources to meet growing electricity demand and it
would be beneficial to allow customers of the utility to own or lease renewable
electric generation systems to help offset the customer's electric load;
   (C)   The safety of utility workers and the general public requires
inspection and testing of equipment arranged for the production of electricity
from solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, or hydroelectric facilities ("renewable
generation facilities") that are owned and operated by residential, commercial

§ 52.22 SEWER RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. Since the sewer rate is based on the customer's water usage,
every customer must pay according to their metered water usage. This policy
shall serve all customers equally and fairly in order to maintain a low rate
and distribute the burden of the rate without any individual customer having to
subsidize another customer's liability.
   (B)   Exclusions. Sewer adjustments will not be allowed for watering
gardens, tobacco, and lawns, or for filling pools and water beds.
   (C)   Inclusions. Sewer adjustments will be allowed for water leaks in a
customer's service line. A SERVICE LINE is that line which extends from the
water meter to the point where the line enters the customer's residence. At the
point where the service enters the residence, it is the customer's
responsibility to install a cutoff valve.
   (D)   Metering fire hydrants. The practice of the Utilities Water Department
installing water meteringequipment on fire hydrants to water gardens, tobacco,
and lawns, or for filling pools and waterbeds is not an acceptable practice,
since this service is not cost effective.

maps and plans must be submitted to the Utilities Water Department. Plans must
outline the proposed distribution system, showing all mains and fire hydrants,
as well as valve locations. Further, planning of the proposed project should
consist of, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Location of other utility service lines, (gas and telephone
underground);
      (2)   Staking of line and grade;
      (3)   Determination of material quantities;
      (4)   The acquisition of all necessary material;
      (5)   Planning and arrangements for the necessary tools, equipment, and
personnel to effectively complete the installation;
      (6)   Obtaining necessary barricades, signs, and safety equipment for
safety on and around the project site; and,

   (A)   Size of water mains will not be less than six inches in diameter,
residential, and not less than eight inches in diameter for commercial/
industrial zoned installations. Material of all mains must be C-900 PVC or cast
iron.
   (B)   Depths of lines shall be not less than three and one half feet but not
more than four feet below ground surface.
   (C)   Loops rather than dead-ends are recommended. Where dead-ends are used,
a two inch minimum blowoff hydrant shall be installed.
   (D)   All material must be provided by the independent contractor from his
supplier. All material is to be of standard quality and weight and mains are to
be provided with properly serviced valves applicable to the size of the main.
   (E)   Under the guidelines and rules of the state, as well as the advice and
instruction of the State Board of Accounts Examiner, the Utilities must not
purchase for resale to contractors, or reduce their inventory by sales to

pipe if a flat bottom trench is permissible. The new main should be back-filled
with clean fill only.
   (C)   All bends, terminal points, and extended appendages, not anchored
positively to the pipe line, should be adequately blocked since pressures tend
to “blow-off” non-anchored ending points.
   (D)   Blowoff valves in low areas and on the ends of pipes shall be provided
for cleaning of a main by flushing.
   (E)   Prior to cover-up of the main, inspection of the work must be made by
the Water Department Superintendent.

§ 53.43 FIRE HYDRANTS.
   Standard “waterous” three-way hydrants are to have six inch or larger
connection to mains with a minimum of five inch valve opening. Hydrants are to
be properly located so that there will be a fire hydrant every 300 feet in the
mercantile (commercial) and industrial areas, and every 600 feet in residential
areas, thus providing every building in the city limits access to a standard
city fire hydrant within 500 feet.

both the contractor and the Utilities Water Department.
      (1)   Before disinfection, the new main must be thoroughly flushed by the
City Water Department with supervision of the Superintendent.
      (2)   The disinfection and bacteriological testing shall be done by the
Water Department Superintendent.
      (3)   During the process of disinfection, a solution of chlorine and
water is put into the main through a corporation stop on the upstream end near
the valve where water is introduced into the system. A 50 PPM (parts per
million) residual shall be required. After 24 hours, there should be a well-
defined residual remaining in the pipe.
      (4)   A subsequent test of a bacteriological sample taken after pipe is
refilled with system water must show no coliform organisms present. The service
line must be tested two consecutive times, 24 hours apart.
   (C)   Fees shall be as set forth in the schedule of non-recurring charges in
§
53.25.
(Ord. 1990-1U, passed - - ; Am. Ord. - , passed 2-4-93)

papers, excess and broken material, excess spoil bank, felled trees, trash, and
the like. Sod, shrubs, and/or trees that have been destroyed or removed in the
process must be replaces. Sidewalks, streets, and curb and gutter, steps,
walls, other utility services, driveways and borrow ditches shall be restored
to original condition or better. Once the restoration is complete and approval
has been made, follow-up inspection of the site should be made by the
contractor or developer or builder to perform necessary maintenance because of
settling of the terrain.

pool of water or any depression in the ground in which water may collect and
become stagnant.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every police officer to report, in writing, at

premises upon which a depression exists, as described above, demanding the
nuisance be abated within ten days.
   (C)   If the person so served does not abate the nuisance within ten days,

lien for the charges as provided in the following division.

above shall be sold for nonpayment of the same and the proceeds of the sale
shall be applied to pay the charges after deducting costs, as is the case in

city. The City Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute these
proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction over

days after it has been rendered.

party/parties regarding any real estate, structure, or building that is in
violation of §

(Ord. 2015-5, passed 5-7-15; Am. Ord. 2023-10, passed 9-7-23)

notified in writing by the Clerk-Treasurer, at the last known address of record
as listed in the records of the Auditor and Treasurer of Ohio County, Indiana,
that the property is in violation of §
93.25 due to the accumulation of weeds and/or other rank vegetation on the
property. The notice shall identify the weeds and/or other rank vegetation that
need to be removed and/or cut, and shall also set forth the area or portion of
the property which requires remediation. The notice shall specifically describe
the real estate by street address, property tax identification number,
location, or other discernible identification.
   (B)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall send notice via First Class U.S. Mail
postage prepaid with a certificate of mailing. In addition, the Clerk-Treasurer
will have a copy of the notice delivered and/or posted at the property by an
officer of the City of Rising Sun Police Department or the Ohio County Sheriffs
Department. The failure on the part of a property owner to receive or collect
their mail shall not serve as a defense to any abatement action or action to
collect for the cost of abatement, administrative costs, or fines.
   (C)   The owner, agent, occupant, leaseholder, individual(s), manager or
representative shall have ten days from the date the above referenced notice is
sent to take the necessary corrective actions or measures to comply with §
93.25.

event the city is required to take whatever action is set forth in the notice
(the “abatement action”), that the expense incurred by the city shall be billed
to the property owner and, if necessary, recovered by appropriate legal action
to obtain a lien against the real estate for the expenses incurred, that the
person to whom the notice is given may be found to have committed a Class A
infraction and, in addition to said expense, may be assessed a fine of up to
$2,500 by a court of competent jurisdiction. The notice shall also include,
pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1-3, that if the weeds and/or other rank vegetation
are required to be removed by the city, any removal costs and administrative
costs of $250 per abatement action, if not paid as hereinafter set forth, will
be collected as delinquent taxes pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1-4. The notice shall
also set forth that the bill is due and owing and must be paid within 30 days
of the date it is mailed by the Clerk-Treasurer if there is a failure to act
upon the notice within ten days.
   (E)   Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1-3(d), if the initial notice of the
violation was provided by First Class U.S. Mail postage prepaid with a
certificate of mailing and delivered and/or posted at the property by an
officer of the City of Rising Sun Police Department or the Ohio County Sheriffs
Department, or equivalent service under I.C. 36-7-10.l-3(c), a continuous
abatement notice may be posted at the property at the time of the abatement
action instead of by registered mail, first class mail or equivalent service as
required under I.C. 36-7-10.1-3(c). This shall be in the form of a notice
posted on the residence or on a sign located on the property. A continuous
abatement notice serves as notice to the real property owner that each
subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial notice of the
violation was provided may be abated by the city or its contractors.

owner as outlined in §
93.28, the Street Commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to take
whatever action was set forth in the notice, including entering the property
and abating the violation, or by directing contractors to do so, and to tender
to the Clerk-Treasurer the costs, expenses, and fees incurred by the Street
Department in executing whatever action the city took to effectuate the action
set forth in the notice. The Clerk-Treasurer shall mail a bill to the address,
as listed at the Offices of the Auditor and the Treasurer of Ohio County,
Indiana, which shall represent removal expenses and administrative expenses/
costs of $250 per abatement action, with a demand for payment within 30 days of
the date said bill is mailed by the Clerk-Treasurer. If the bill is not paid
within 30 days as herein set forth, the Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized
and directed to collect the bill by either manner provided in I.C. 36-7-10.1-4.
If disbursement is received from the County Auditor pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.l-
4(a), said disbursements should be placed in the general fund of the Street
Department in accordance with I.C. 36-7-10.1-5.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 5-7-15; Am. Ord. 2023-10, passed 9-7-23)
§ 93.30 APPEAL.
   Any individual, company, corporation, or any other entity receiving a notice
in violation of §
93.25 or a bill issued because of any abatement action taken by the city, the
individual, company, corporation, or any other entity has a right to appeal the
notice or such bill by filing with the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office a request for
an appeal within ten days of the date the notice or bill was mailed. The
request for an appeal must be in writing and the appeal will be reviewed at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Common Council. The individual,
company, corporation, or any other entity appealing the notice or bill shall
personally appear before the Common Council to present the nature of the appeal
and the decision of the Common Council regarding the notice or billing shall be
final. Should the individual, company, corporation, or any other entity fail to
appear for the appeal review, the appeal will be dismissed and the Street
Department shall be directed to carry out all necessary abatement actions and
the property owner will be billed by the city accordingly.

   DECIBEL (dB). A unit for measuring the volume of a sound, equal to 20 times
the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound
measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons
per square meter).
   NOISE LEVEL. The A-weighted sound level produced by a motor vehicle.
   SOUND LEVEL METER. An instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS
detector, integrator or time average, output meter and weighting networks used

or other device operated by engine exhaust; the use of any such signaling
device when traffic is for any reason held up AFTER a termination request. The
operation of any such horn, whistle, or signaling device in such a manner as to

the attention of the public to any building or structure in a continuous or
repeated unreasonably loud and raucous manner AFTER a termination request. The
operation of any such set, instrument, phonograph, machine or device in such a
manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet from the building,
structure, or vehicle in which it is located after a termination request shall

defective muffler or exhaust system as to create an unreasonable loud and/or
unnecessary engine noise, grating, grinding, rattling, or other noise AFTER a
termination request. The operation of any such automobile, motorcycle, or
vehicle in such a manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet from
the vehicle in which it is located after a termination request shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation of this division (B)(5).

unnecessary grinding, rattling, or other vehicle disrepair AFTER a termination
request. The operation of any such automobile, motorcycle, or vehicle in such a
manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet from the vehicle in
which it is located after a termination request shall be prima facie evidence
of a violation of this division (B)(6).
      (7)   The creation of an unreasonably loud and excessive noise in
connection with loading or unloading any vehicle or the opening and destruction
of bales, boxes, crates, and containers AFTER a termination request. The

street adjacent to any school, institution of learning, church, or court, while
the same are in use, or adjacent to any hospital, which unreasonably interferes
with the workings of such institution, or which unduly disturbs patients in the
hospital, provided conspicuous signs are displayed in such streets indicating

of a violation of this division (B)(8).
   (C)   Decibel based prohibition. In addition to the prohibitions at division
(B)(1) through (B)(8) of this section, the following acts are declared to be
loud, raucous, or disturbing noises in violation of this section, based on
decibel (dB):
      (1)   Any noise that exceeds a level of 83 dBA based on a distance from
the noise source of not less than 15 feet, and irrespective of the 50 feet
standard set forth in division (B)(1) through (B)(8) of this section, shall be
prima facie evidence of a noise prohibited by this section. All provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence to the contrary notwithstanding, noise that
creates fewer decibels than 83 dBA from 15 feet also constitutes noise
prohibited by this section if such noise otherwise constitutes a prohibited
noise stated in this section. Further, there is not any decibel measurement
requirement necessary to prove the existence of a noise prohibited by this
section.
   (D)   Additional prohibitions unrelated to termination request or dBA level.
      (1)   The operation by a business of outdoor public address systems
within 500 feet of any residence.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2006-4, passed 7-6-06; Am. Ord. 2013-11, passed 12-19-13)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Rising Sun are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2006-4, passed 7-6-06; Am. Ord. 2013-11, passed 12-19-13)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and,
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2006-4, passed 7-6-06; Am. Ord. 2013-11, passed 12-19-13)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2006-4, passed 7-6-06; Am. Ord. 2013-11, passed 12-19-13)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one to
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating  purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system
has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (to an existing structure). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See the definition for STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:

of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.

provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to innudation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.

residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,

greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.

currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the

below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters,
by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in
a minimum of two exterior walls, if a structure has more than one enclosed
area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city are
generally identified as such on the Ohio County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated March 3, 2014, as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footing, installation of
piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation for
placement of a manufactured  home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.

or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a
historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted to DNR for
approval and then to FEMA as a letter of map revision (See §
151.22(B)(6) for additional information).
   (B)   Construction stage.  
      (1)   Upon establishment/placement of the lowest floor, before framing
continues, to indicate and floodproofing it shall be the duty of the applicant
to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or
NGVD elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same.
When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer
or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of
the floodproofing certification shall be at the applicant’s risk. (The
Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing
elevation survey data submitted.) The applicant shall correct deficiencies
detected by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure
to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall
be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      (2)   Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation
certification shall be at the applicant’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation survey data submitted.
The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such review. Failure
to submit the elevation certification or failure to make correction required
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, a FEMA
elevation certificate, Form 81-31, which depicts all finished construction, is
required to be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project
includes a floodproofing measure, a FEMA floodproofing certificate, Form 81-65,
is required to be submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

(Ord. 2006-4, passed 7-6-06; Am. Ord. 2013-11, passed 12-19-13)
§ 151.34 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in a
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition so that under the national or pre-floodway condition as
proven within hydraulic analysis.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. 65.12.

§ 151.35 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the focal floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 151.36 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in the floodway permit (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
construction in a floodway permit (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodway, fringe and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.30 through
151.36 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.
