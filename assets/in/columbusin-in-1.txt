PREFACE
   The Columbus Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company
in 1994, is being kept current by regular supplementation by American Legal
Publishing as of 2006.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of Peter King, city attorney and Betty Jean Beshear, purchasing coordinator.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine
vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions.
Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
   In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying
the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative
history is complemented by a prior code cross-reference table, which sets out
the location of individual sections of the prior code, and an ordinance
disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all
ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. A
subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code
provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 27-2024, passed
August 6, 2024.

be certified, within thirty days, to the common council for final approval. If
an application or funding recommendation has been denied then that portion
which pertains to the city's fund shall be certified, within thirty days, to
the common council only upon the written request of the applicant. In the event
that such application does not receive a majority vote, the application shall
automatically be certified within thirty days to the common council. The

be obligated to develop a set of standards and applicable rules concerning the
processing of grants and the purposes and goals for which the grant money will
be utilized. Such standards shall include a limitation of the total annual
amounts being limited to a maximum of the annual interest earned on the

   i.   From time to time, take official action by granting or denying

nonreverting fund, to pay the county's portion of such request. If the county
commissioners deny the request it will not be forwarded to the county council;
   iii.   In the event that an application would be approved by the county, but
denied by the city, the application shall be returned to the county
commissioners for a hearing to determine whether the county is willing to fund
the entire cost of the application solely from the county's portion of the
funds. If the county commissioners approve utilizing only county funds to fund
the application, the county council shall appropriate the necessary funds from
the county's nonreverting fund. If the county commissioners deny the
application it shall be deemed denied and shall not be forwarded to the county
council.

3.04.050 Internal control standards.
   A.   Policy. The purpose of this policy is to communicate the common
council's objectives of a reliable internal control system to all employees and
elected officials of the city. Special consideration is being placed on the
five key components of internal controls as established by the Indiana State
Board of Accounts, which include seventeen key principles.
   B.   Component one: control environment.
   1.   Principle 1: The oversight body and management demonstrate a commitment
to integrity and ethical values.
   a.   The city has the responsibility to promote confidence in city business
regarding the official conduct of all areas of city government, including
councilors, appointees, employees, and elected officials. As part of its
commitment to an overall system of internal control, integrity, and ethical
values, the common council developed and adopted a code of ethical conduct
policy on May 7, 2013, Resolution No. 8, 2013.
   b.   The city also has the responsibility to establish and maintain an
adequate system of internal control and to furnish to the common council,
various boards and commissions, governmental agencies, creditors and others
reliable financial information on a timely basis. An adequate system of
internal control is necessary for the city to discharge these responsibilities.
   c.   Controls help ensure that assets are not exposed to unauthorized access
and use, transactions are properly recorded in the financial records, and the
financial information is reliable. External organizations and stakeholders of
the city rely on financial information to make decisions toward appropriations,
loans and other debt, grants, and other contractual relationships. city
resources are dependent upon the system of internal control. Auditors are
required annually to report upon the adequacy of the city's systems for control
over financial reporting and compliance per I.C. 5-11-1-27(e). The safeguarding
of city assets and the reliability which the city and others can place upon its
financial records is dependent upon the effectiveness of the internal control
process.
   d.   Many areas of the internal control system are covered within the
accounting and uniform compliance guideline manual for cities and towns which
was established by the state board of accounts, such as personal expenses,
personal property use, political expenditures, private property usage, etc.
This manual is a reference and guideline for all employees especially those in
the city controller's office. The city's employee personnel booklet has also
been designed to guide and train employees toward its mission of maintaining
internal control.
   e.   The city controller's office has established safeguards to promote
efficiency and minimize risks of asset loss, which helps ensure the reliability
of financial information, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. The office of the city controller and other city leaders
periodically evaluate the city's internal control system for weaknesses,
providing solutions to any discovered weaknesses, and inform employees of
necessary changes in procedures.
   f.   The city, with assistance of the Human Resources Department, will
establish a confidential reporting system for individuals to report suspected
fraud and abuse of internal control policies. In addition to the confidential
reporting, the Human Resources Department will institute procedures to address
violations of policies and consequences for violations.
   2.   Principle 2: The oversight body oversees the entity's internal control
system.
   a.   As the fiscal body for the city, the common council is responsible for
setting internal control expectations for ensuring management is aware of the
those expectations, requiring the upward communications channels are open
through all levels of management, and evaluating management's effectiveness
toward monitoring the control environment and implementing sound control
policies and procedures.
   3.   Principle 3: Management establishes an organizational structure,
assigns responsibility, and delegates authority to achieve the entity's
objectives.
   a.   Individuals with delegated approval authority, e.g. elected officials
and department heads are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and
supporting a system of internal controls within their areas of responsibility
and for creating the control environment that encourages compliance with city
policies and procedures. They should provide common council with an
organizational chart.
   b.   All levels of management and supervision are responsible for
strengthening internal controls when weaknesses are detected. Department
managers should periodically review departmental procedures to ensure that the
general principles of internal control are being followed.
   c.   The clerk-treasurer has the primary responsibility for internal
controls which provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial information and records, effectiveness and efficiency of operations,
proper execution of management's objective, and compliance with laws and
regulations. Segregation of duties, safeguarding controls over cash and all
other assets and all forms of information processing are necessary for proper
internal control. Internal controls should also be in place for receipting,
disbursing, recording and accounting for the financial activities necessary to
avoid substantial risk of invalid transactions, inaccurate records and
financial statements.
   d.   The Human Resources Department is responsible for internal controls
over employee recruitment, hiring, separation, promotion, job classification,
employee rights, and salary administration. This department is the city's
source for information and assistance on this topic and will make resources
available to assist in administering this policy.
   e.   All levels of internal control are subject to examination by external
auditors who are required to report on the adequacy of internal controls over
finance and compliance.
   f.   Department heads and the Human Resource Department are responsible for
prompt corrective action on all internal control findings and recommendations
made by internal and external auditors. The audit process is completed only
after department heads receive the audit results and take action to correct
internal control weaknesses, improve systems, or demonstrate that management
action is not warranted. Department heads have the responsibility to ensure
that those who report to them have adequate knowledge, skills, and abilities to
function within, and contribute to, an effective internal control environment.
This includes providing access to appropriate training on topics relevant to
their job responsibilities.
   4.   Principle 4: Management demonstrates a commitment to recruit, develop,
and retain competent individuals.
   a.   City leaders determine skills necessary for each level of the
organizational chart by creating job descriptions and requirements for each
position. Hiring processes will be documented. Evaluations are completed on a
regular basis and, if necessary, address any deficiency in skill level or
performance. Prior to employment, individuals may be subject to pre-employment
background screening and/or a credit history check. Department Heads will
determine required training for employees, track the process and review courses
with employees. The city will continue to assess the best recruitment pools and
tools for the different skill sets of skills necessary to adequately implement
and maintain quality internal controls.
   b.   Job descriptions will be updated where necessary to reflect internal
control responsibilities and duties. Employees will be regularly trained in
internal control methods and all training will be documented in employees'
personnel files. Employees will be regularly evaluated by their supervisors on
internal control duties and receive feedback on possible improvements.
   5.   Principle 5: Management evaluates performance and holds individuals
accountable for their internal control responsibilities.
   a.   City leaders and the Human Resources Department have developed a formal
employee evaluation system to assess performance and hold each individual
accountable for their internal control responsibilities. Performance reviews
will be filed in the Human Resources Department and kept as a permanent record.
   b.   City administration will address issues in specific departments and
positions through regular communication with all departments.
   C.   Component two: risk assessment.
   1.   Principle 6: Management defines objectives clearly to enable the
identification of risks and risk tolerances. Through the creation of standard
operating procedures and accurate organizational reporting charts, management
conveys and identifies objectives, missions, policies, and risk tolerances to
employees.
   a.   City leaders will lead a risk analysis in three major areas:
   i.   Operations - Effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
   ii.   Reporting - Reliability of reporting for internal and external use.
   iii.   Compliance - Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
   b.   City leaders will define objectives in specific measurable terms in
order to enable the design of internal control for related risks, to increase
understanding at all levels, and to assess performance. They will also identify
what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and when
it will be achieved. State statutes, and guidelines listed in the Accounting
Uniform Compliance Manual will be incorporated in the objectives.
   2.   Principle 7: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to risks
related to achieving the defined objectives.
   a.   City leaders will identify, analyze, and respond to the risks
identified in this principle by determining:
   i.   Insurance coverages;
   ii.   Worker safety training;
   iii.   How likely is the risk to occur?;
   iv.   How will it impact the objective?;
   v.   Is the risk based on complex or unusual transactions?; and
   vi.   Is the risk based on fraud?
   b.   Once each risk has been identified and analyzed, management will
determine how to respond to each risk individually and design specific actions
accordingly.
   3.   Principle 8: Management considers the potential for fraud when
identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks.
City leaders are committed to fraud prevention through continual analysis of
possible fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, and
illegal acts. Fraud responses will include statutorily required responses as
directed under Ind. I.C. 5-11-1-27(l) relating to the report of
misappropriation of funds to State Board of Accounts and Prosecuting Attorney.
Report of material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts will be conveyed to
the State Board of Accounts under I.C. 5-11-1-270). The city shall utilize a
materiality threshold of $500.
   4.   Principle 9: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to
significant changes that could impact the internal control system.
   a.   City leaders and department heads will implement a training process of
internal controls and employee policies for all new employees.
   b.   They will also regularly reevaluate policies and procedures to
determine if existing controls will continue to be effective or if new controls
need to be designed and implemented.
   D.   Component three: control activities.
   1.   Principle 10: Management designs control activities to achieve
objectives and respond to risks.
   a.   The clerk-treasurer's office will establish and maintain a system of

part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards). The guidance is applicable to entities
receiving Federal funding. As a consequence, when conducting the biennial
audit, Indiana State Board of Accounts reviews the City's expenditures
utilizing the Single Audit requirements found in 2 CFR part 200.500 - 200.521
of Uniform Grant Guidance including the Compliance Supplements for all Federal
Funding sources to assure compliance with all grant agreements, rules,
regulations, bulletins, directives, letters, letter rulings, court decisions,
and filing requirements concerning reports and other procedural matters of
Federal and State agencies.
   H.   A Single Audit or program-specific audit is required if the city
receives $750,000 or more in Federal awards during its fiscal year.
Subsequently, if the city has a non-federal governmental or nonprofit entity
administering (holding) a contract with Federal funds that pass through the
City, or a sub-recipient, the city must:
   1.   Ensure sub-recipients comply with all Federal laws including receipt
and review of their single audits;
   a.   Send form requesting listing of Federal funds received in fiscal year;
   b.   If receiving $750,000+ a single audit is due 9 months of year end or
within 30-days of completion whichever occurs first;
   2.   Monitor performance scheduled for achievement; and

applicant's representative, should the committee determine that the applicant
has failed to substantially comply and/or has wilfully failed to comply with

the statement of benefits form. Based upon the information presented at the
hearing by the applicant and other interested parties, the council shall then
determine whether the applicant has made reasonable efforts to substantially
comply with the statement of benefits form and whether any failure to
substantially comply was caused by factors beyond the control of the applicant.
If the council determines that the applicant has not made reasonable efforts to
comply with the statement of benefits form, the council shall pass a resolution
seeking the termination of the applicant's deduction under Section 3 or Section
4.5 of Indiana Code, 6-1.1—12.1-1 et seq. Should the common council adopt such
resolution, the applicant's deduction will not apply in the next installment of
property taxes owed by the property owner or applicant or to any subsequent
installment of property taxes on the specific real property or personal
property that was the subject of the deduction.
   B.   Upon passage of such resolution terminating a deduction, the common
council, through the office of the city controller, shall immediately mail a
certified copy of the resolution to:

of benefits form prior to the purchase of said personal property and/or the
construction or improvement within the designated economic revitalization area.

5.16.020   Filing and review of rates.
   
5.16.030   Provisions generally applicable to rate orders.
   
5.16.040   Franchisees' duties.
   
5.16.050   Duties of the city clerk-treasurer, city attorney and
telecommunication commission.

5.16.080   Petition for change in status.
   
5.16.090   Filing and prosecuting complaints concerning cable programming
services and equipment.
5.16.010 Scope and applicability.
   This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment
within the city for any franchisee which has been notified that: (a) the city
has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and (b)
the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and
equipment rates. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent
with all Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations governing the
regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and
interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if
those regulations were set forth in full herein; a cable franchisee is
prohibited from engaging in any activity it is prohibited from engaging in
under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein. For purposes
of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the
same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. Sec. 76.901; the term
"equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47
C.F.R. Sec. 76.923; and the term "telecommunication commission" refers to the
Bartholomew/Columbus telecommunication commission established by Ordinance No.
2998 and as thereafter amended, the term "city council" refers to the common
council of the city of Columbus, and the term "city clerk-treasurer" refers to
the clerk-treasurer of the city of Columbus. (Ord. 93-44 § 1, 1993)
5.16.020 Filing and review of rates.
   A.    Initial Filings By Franchises.
   1.   Filings—When Made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic service
and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission (the rate
filing) within thirty days of the notification, justifying its then-existing
basic service and equipment rates. All rates, for all customer classifications,
must be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by the city that its
rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for
basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This
requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates
announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to
regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of
notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic
service or equipment rates or any new basic service or equipment rate
(collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An increase occurs when
there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services.
Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review
at least thirty days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase.
This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement.
   2.   Filings—Where Made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the city
clerk-treasurer and simultaneously with the telecommunication commission. A
rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the rate filing
and all required copies are received by the city clerk-treasurer and the
telecommunication commission. Five copies of each rate filing (including all
supporting materials) must be submitted to the city clerk-treasurer and five
copies must be submitted to the telecommunication commission.
   3.   Filings—Contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden
of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the
franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable.
Except as inconsistent with FCC rules:
   a.   Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter whether it
justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The cover letter
must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part based upon cost
of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain information
that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether any part of
the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an alleged
increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief,
narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service;
   b.   The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially;
   c.   The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these forms
must be correctly completed;
   d.   If different rates are proposed for basic service for different classes
of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the differences
in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law.
   4.   If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of service,
the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an opportunity to
recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic cable service,
including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not presumed
reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A franchisee
is not entitled to recover monopoly rents in any form.
   5.   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide,
and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who seeks
to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of service must
submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs
and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by the
franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system within
the meaning of 47 U.S.C. Sec. 522(4). The cost of service must identify the
accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each
expense or revenue identified was aggregated and show clearly how the expense
or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting
level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to
the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving the city is a
part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and
supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with
which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from
the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were
included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly
show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of
that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the
derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate
for:
   a.   Operation and maintenance expenses;
   b.   Administrative and general expenses;
   c.   Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and
copyright fees separately);
   d.   Costs for PEG access and any institutional network;
   e.   Franchise fee expense;
   f.   Investment in the system and associated depreciation;
   g.   Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized; and
   h.   The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by the
franchisee.
   6.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit
the cost of service specified in subsection (A) (5) of this section for
equipment rates, and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the
costs of equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost-of-service filing
submitted to justify basic service rates must show that the cost of service
does not include equipment costs.
   B.    Initial City Review.
   1.   After receiving a rate filing, the city clerk-treasurer shall promptly
cause to be published a notice that a filing has been received and that, except
for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for
public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on
the filing, and shall provide interested parties seven days to submit written
comments on the filing to the city clerk-treasurer, who shall promptly submit
copies of all such comments to the telecommunications commission. The
telecommunication commission shall submit the comments received and its
recommendations for action to the city council no later than twenty days after
the filing, and shall make those recommendations available for public
inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or the
telecommunication commission's recommendations, but must do so no later than
three business days after the telecommunication commission's recommendations
are submitted to the city council. The response shall be filed both with the
city clerk-treasurer and the telecommunication commission, and if submitted in
a timely fashion, the city clerk-treasurer shall forward a copy to the city
council.
   2.   Within thirty days of the date of the filing, the city council shall
issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed
rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or
tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the city council tolls the rate
in whole or in part, its written order shall explain that it requires
additional time to review the rate filing, identify generally any then-known
deficiencies in the franchisee's filing and state that the franchisee may cure
any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided
in subsection C of this section. With respect to existing rates, tolling means
the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate
changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go
into effect.
   C.    Supplementary Filings.
   1.   If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee shall
submit a supplementary filing twenty days from the date the tolling order
issues, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required
supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to information filed
by interested parties or to the recommendations of the telecommunication
commission, or any additional information necessary to support the proposed
rate. Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with subsection (A) (2)
of this section.
   2.   A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city
directs the franchisee to provide.
   3.   In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide,
and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who claims
that it is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the adjustments
for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. Sec. 76.922(d) (1) —
(2) must submit the following:
   a.   A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was derived;
   b.   A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC
regulations), the amount of that external costs for the two calendar years
prior to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is
made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the
year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The
statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming
services. "Revenues" includes all revenues, in whatever form received;
   c.   If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming service
costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has increased; a
sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs increased
where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by FCC
regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than twelve
months, the prior contract for the service;
   d.   A sworn statement by the franchisee's chief financial officer or an
independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all
external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any
increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount
by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47
C.F.R. Sec. 76.922(d) (2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to
recover any external cost to the extent that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and
affirming that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the
cost of programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R.
Sec. 76.922(d)(2)(vi).
   4.   Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the city clerk-treasurer shall
promptly cause to be published a notice that a filing has been received and
that it is available for public review (except those parts which may be
withheld as proprietary). The notice shall state that interested parties may
comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties twenty days to
submit written comments on the filing to the city clerk-treasurer. The city
clerk-treasurer shall promptly forward copies of any comments received to the
telecommunication commission. The telecommunication commission shall submit the
comments received and its recommendations for action to the city council no
later than thirty days prior to the date the city council must act under
subsection (C)(6) of this section. The recommendations shall be made available
for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments
or the telecommunication commission's recommendations, but must do so no later
than ten days after the telecommunication commission's recommendations are
submitted to the city council. The response shall be filed with the city clerk-
treasurer and the telecommunication commission, and if submitted in a timely
fashion, the city clerk-treasurer shall forward a copy to the city council.
   5.   The city council shall issue a written order, which may be in any
lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the
proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in
whole or in part, subject to refund. If the city council issues an order
allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct
the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Sec.
76.933.
   6.   The order specified in subsection (C) (5) of this section shall be
issued ninety days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee
justifies based on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be issued within one
hundred fifty days of the tolling order for any rate. The franchisee justifies
with a cost-of-service showing. (Ord. 93-44 § 2, 1993)
5.16.030 Provisions generally applicable to rate orders.
   A.   Any rate order of the city council shall be effective on adoption. Each
rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee. In any case
where the city council approves, denies, or tolls a rate; orders that a rate
may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or establishes rates,
the city clerk-treasurer shall cause a public notice to be published stating
that the order has issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be
in writing.
   B.   The city council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from
taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order
or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may
require refunds, set rates and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or
through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. Any order
prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was
unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before
prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the city council shall
ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed
rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the telecommunication commission
propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the
franchisee at the time it is submitted to the city council shall be deemed to
provide the franchisee this notice and the franchisee must comment on the
refund or rate in its response to the recommendations.
   C.   No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be
interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every
such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and
refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the
same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not
limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right
to reduce a franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund any
amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by
federal law. (Ord. 93-44 § 3, 1993)
5.16.040 Franchisees' duties.
   A.   A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including
prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty days of the date the city
council issues an order mandating a remedy.
   B.   Within ninety days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a
franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of
the cable company, stating:
   1.   Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of the
city council's order; and
   2.   Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the city
council's order; and
   3.   Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and
distributed.
   C.   It is each franchisee's responsibility to keep accurate and adequate
books and records of account so that it can properly and accurately refund any
amounts owed to subscribers.
   D.   It is each franchisee's duty to submit as complete and accurate a
filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing
that is incomplete or inaccurate under applicable law shall be treated as an
evasion of this ordinance.
   E.    Information Requests.
   1.   A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or
expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to requests
for information from the city council and the telecommunication commission by
deadlines established by those bodies. A franchisee is responsible for ensuring
that such other entity responds to the city's requests of the city council and
the telecommunication commission.
   2.   Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response
to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by Section 5.16.020
(B) issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for
information regarding its filing within five days of the date an information
request is mailed to it. The information may include the information the
franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing.
(Ord. 93-44 § 4, 1993)
5.16.050 Duties of the city clerk-treasurer, city attorney and
telecommunication commission.
   A.   The city clerk-treasurer shall ensure notices are given to the public
and each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations.
   B.   The city attorney shall rule on any request for confidentiality.
   C.   The telecommunication commission shall be responsible for administering
the other provisions herein. Without limitation and by way of illustration:
   1.   The telecommunication commission may submit requests for information to
the franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in
Section 5.16.040.
   2.   For good cause, the telecommunication commission may waive any
provision herein or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to
such matters as are mandatory under FCC regulations.
   3.   The telecommunication commission shall prepare the recommendations to
the city council contemplated by Section 5.16.020 (B) and (C). If the
telecommunication commission recommends that any proposed rate increase be
denied in whole or in part, it shall:
   a.   Recommend a rate and explain the basis for that recommendation (the
telecommunication commission may also recommend that rates remain at existing
levels); and
   b.   Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and
   c.   Notify the franchisee of its recommendations at the time they are
submitted to the city council. (Ord. 93-44 § 5, 1993)
5.16.060 Penalties and forfeitures.
   Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to
penalties and forfeitures under any and all applicable provisions of law and
under its franchise agreement, and its request for approval of a rate may be
denied, if it:
   A.   Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city or the
telecommunication commission in connection with any rate proceeding;
   B.   Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city or the
telecommunication commission, including, but not limited to, a request for
information or an order setting rates; or
   C.   Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided
that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable
is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. (Ord.
93-44 § 6, 1993)
5.16.070 Proprietary information.
   A.   If these provisions, or any request for information, requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the
information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is
submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its
response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The
request must identify specifically what portions of the information are
requested to receive confidential treatment; must state the reason why the
franchisee believes the information should be treated as proprietary; and must
set forth the facts (and legal argument where appropriate) that support those
reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines
that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent
with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552. The
city shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in
information being withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the
request is denied: (1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it
may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information
will be returned to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five
working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information
will be stayed pending review.
   B.   Any interested party may file with the city clerktreasurer a request to
inspect material withheld as proprietary. The city attorney shall weigh the
policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for
permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. The city
attorney will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable
franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request.
The city may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the
franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any
appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
(Ord. 93-44 § 7, 1993)

47 C.F.R. Sec. 79.15. The petition and five copies must be filed with the city
clerk-treasurer, and five copies must be filed with the telecommunication
commission. (Ord. 93-44 § 8, 1993)

responsible for any costs incurred during confinement. If there is no known
owner of the animal, then the animal shall be quarantined at the Animal Care
Services Center.

release from quarantine, the animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian
who shall certify the animal as not being rabid. This certification must be
presented to the Bartholomew County Health Department within three days of the
examination. The owner is responsible for the certification. If the owner is
unknown, Animal Care Services shall be responsible for the certification.
   D.   It is unlawful for the owner of any warm-blooded animal, when notified
that such animal has bitten, scratched or caused an abrasion of the skin of a
human being, or is known or suspected of being rabid, to sell, give away, allow
to escape, or be taken from the limits of the city during the quarantine
period.
   E.   If the animal is a wild animal, exotic or a domestic animal that is
injured or diseased, and the owner is unknown, then Animal Care Services or the
Bartholomew County Health Department may require the animal be euthanized and
the head removed, and transported to the State Board of Health prior to the
expiration of the quarantine requirement.
   F.   If it should be determined that an animal is rabid, then it shall be
euthanized by a licensed veterinarian, the head of the animal removed by a
licensed veterinarian and transported to the State Board of Health. The cost of
euthanasia, removal of the head, and transportation shall be the responsibility
of the owner. If the owner is unknown, then the cost shall be the
responsibility of Animal Care Services.

refer the matter to the city attorney for collection. In the event the city
attorney takes action to collect any unpaid amount, the user shall be
responsible for paying the city's reasonable attorneys fees incurred as a
result. The right of the city attorney to initiate an action for collection of
unpaid fees is in addition to, and not in derogation of any other right of the
city to seek any other remedy against the user or to enforce any lien provided
by law upon the user's property.

9.24.020 Public policy.
   A.   It is the public policy of the city to provide all persons an equal
opportunity for and in education, employment, public accommodations and
acquisition through purchase or rental of real property including but not
limited to housing. Equal educational and employment opportunities and equal
access to and use of public accommodations and equal opportunities for
acquisition of real property and access to credit as defined in Indiana Code,
24-4.5-1-301, are declared to be civil rights.
   B.   The practice of denying these civil rights to a person by reason of
race, religion, color, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, ancestry,
sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or status as veteran of such
individual is contrary to the principles of equal opportunity stated in this
chapter and shall be considered discriminatory practices.
   C.   The promotion of equal opportunity without regard to race, religion,
color, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, gender identity, age or status as veteran through enforcement,
public education and other reasonable methods is the purpose of this chapter.
It is also its purpose to protect employers, labor organizations, employment
agencies, property owners, real estate brokers, lending institutions and
insurance companies from unfounded charges of discrimination through the
professional investigation and resolution of complaints.
   D.   This chapter shall be construed broadly to effectuate its purpose.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-2)
9.24.030 Discriminatory housing practices unlawful.
   The following discriminatory housing practices are declared to be unlawful:
   A.   For any person or agent to refuse to sell, lease, rent, assign or
otherwise transfer or refuse to negotiate for the sale, lease, sublease, rental
or other transfer of the title, leasehold or other interest in any housing unit
to any person or to represent that the housing unit is not available for
inspection, sale, lease, sublease, rental, assignment or other transfer, when
in fact, it is so available or otherwise deny or withhold any housing unit from
any person because of race, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry,
religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or status as veteran;
   B.   For any person or agent to discriminate in the terms, conditions or
privileges of the sale, rental or lease of any housing unit or in the

account of race, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, religion,
sexual orientation, gender identity age, or status as veteran;
   C.   For any person or agent to publish or circulate or cause to be
published or circulated any notice, statement or advertisement or to announce a
policy or to use any form or application for the purchase, lease, rental,
financing or insuring of housing in connection with the prospective purchase,
lease, rental, financing or insuring of housing which expresses directly or
indirectly any limitation or specification as to race, color, sex, disability,
national origin, religion, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, age,
or status as veteran or any intent to make any such limitations, specifications
or discrimination;
   D.   For any lending institution, including government agencies, to
discriminate in lending money, guaranteeing loans, accepting mortgages or

gender identity, age, or status as veteran of any prospective buyer or seller;
   E.   For any person, individually or in combination, to aid, incite, compel,
coerce, participate in or contact for the joining of any act declared to be an
unlawful housing practice under this section or to directly or indirectly
commit any act declared by this section to be a discriminatory housing
practice.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-3)
9.24.040 Sex discrimination.
   A.   A written or unwritten act, policy, practice or system which excludes
an individual from equal opportunities on the basis of sex or because of sex,
sexual orientation, or gender identity in any terms or conditions of
employment, education, public accommodations, credit or housing, shall be
considered a discriminatory practice.
   B.   The term "sex discrimination" as it applies to segregation or
separation in this chapter applies to all covered types of employment,
education, public accommodations and housing; provided, however, that:
      1.   It shall not be a discriminatory practice to maintain separate
restrooms; and that
      2.   It shall not be unlawful employment practice for an employer to hire
and employ employees, for an employment agency to classify or refer for
employment agency to classify or refer for employment an individual, for a
labor organization to classify its membership or to classify or refer for
employment any individual, or for an employer, labor organization or joint
labor management committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or
retraining programs to admit or to employ another individual in any such
program on the basis of sex in those certain instances where sex is a bona fide
occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that
particular business or enterprise; and that
      3.   It shall not be a discriminatory practice for a private or religious
educational institution to continue to maintain and enforce a policy of
admitting students of one sex only; and that
      4.   It shall not be a discriminatory practice under Section
9.24.030 for an owner of a single family unit who resides therein but rents or
leases rooms in that same unit to lease to individuals of one sex only.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-4)
9.24.050 Sexual harassment.
   Harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity shall
be considered an unlawful employment practice. Unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of sexual
nature constitute sexual harassment when:
   A.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment; or
   B.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as
the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
   C.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment; or
   D.   In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment,
the commission will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the
circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in
which the alleged incidents occurred.
   The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from
the facts on a case-by-case basis.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-5)
9.24.060 Pregnancy discrimination.
   A.   A written or unwritten employment policy or practice which excludes
from employment opportunities applicants or employees because of pregnancy,
childbirth or related medical conditions is in violation of this chapter.
   B.   Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, childbirth or
related medical conditions, for all job-related purposes, shall be treated the
same as disabilities caused or contributed to by other medical conditions,
under any health or disability insurance or sick leave plan available in
connection with employment. Written or unwritten employment policies and
practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the
availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority and other benefits and
privileges, reinstatement and payment under any health or disability insurance
or sick leave plan, formal or informal, shall be applied to disability due to
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions on the same terms and
conditions as they are applied to other disabilities. Health insurance benefits
for abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the
fetus were carried to term or where medical complications have arisen from an
abortion, are not required to be paid by an employer; nothing herein, however,
precludes an employer from providing abortion benefits or otherwise affects the
bargaining agreements in regard to abortion.
   C.   Where the termination of an employee who is temporarily disabled is
caused by an employment policy under which insufficient or no leave is
available, such termination violates this chapter if it has a disparate impact
on employees of one sex and is not justified by business necessity.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-6)
9.24.070 Wage discrimination.
   No employer shall discriminate within any establishment between employees on
the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity by paying wages to
employees in such establishment, a rate less than the rate at which he or she
pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal
work on jobs of the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and
responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions,
except where such payment is made pursuant to:
   1.   A seniority system;
   2.   A merit system;
   3.   A system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production;
or
   4.   A differential based on any other factor other than sex.
   B.   An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of the
above shall not, in order to comply with this provision, reduce the wage rate
of any other employee.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-7)
9.24.080 Discrimination because of disability.
   A.   The prohibition against discrimination in employment, because of
disability does not apply to failure of an employer to employ or retain as an
employee any individual who because of a disability is physically or otherwise
unable to efficiently and safely perform, at the standards set by the employer,
the duties required in that job.
   B.   After a person with a disability is employed, the employer shall not be
required under this chapter to promote or transfer such person to another job
or occupation, unless, prior to such transfer, such person is qualified for
such job or occupation.
   C.   This section shall not be construed to require any employer to modify
any physical accommodations or administrative procedures to accommodate a
handicapped individual.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-8)
9.24.090 City contracts.
   Every contract to which the city or any of its political or civil
subdivisions is a party, including franchises granted to the utility service
board of the city, shall contain a provision requiring the contractor and his
subcontractors not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for
employment who is to be employed in the performance of such contract with
respect to his or her hire, tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of
employment or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment because
of his or her race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin,
ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or status as veteran.
Breach of this covenant may be considered a material breach of the contract.
(Ord. 19-2015 § 1 (part), 2015; Ord. 92-45 (part), 1992; prior code § 12-9)
9.24.100 Territorial applicability of chapter.
   This chapter applies to practices within the city and to housing units and
dwellings located within the city, except that a commission formed pursuant to
this chapter shall have no jurisdiction over the state or any of its agencies.
Such state agencies are those as defined under Section
9.20.010.

being performed or event being contemplated.

avenue names and designations, and also showing block numbers both north,
south, east and west for the annexed area which is now on file in the office of
the city clerk is incorporated by reference thereto and made part of this
chapter.
   B.   The map is available for public inspection during regular business
hours. (Ord. 33-2023, 2023; Prior code § 27-1)
12.04.020 Points of reference.
   The following points of reference constitute the base lines of the
geographical grid system: commencing on the north line of Water Street as the
basis for numbering all streets running north and south; commencing on the
meridian running north and south through a point three hundred twelve feet west
of the southwest corner of Lindsay Street and First Street as the basis for
numbering all streets running east and west. (Prior code § 27-5)
12.04.030 Numbering of buildings.
   All buildings shall be numbered according to the geographical grid system
established for the city in 1879 by Ordinance No. 230. Such system is founded
upon base lines from which number lines designated by hundreds are assigned to
generally parallel grid lines. (Prior code § 27-4)
12.04.040 Numbering of squares.
   The numbering of squares which will be bounded by grid lines, assigned one
hundred numbers, and coincide with streets insofar as practical, shall be as
follows: numbers  from one to one hundred inclusive are assigned to the square
between Water Street and First Street, and the square between such meridian
line and Lindsay Street. In the same manner one hundred numbers in consecutive
hundreds are assigned to each successive square according to the grid system.
East and West grid lines are numbered 0, 100, 200, etc., from such meridian
line east, and 0, 100, 200, etc., from such meridian line west. North and south
grid lines are numbered in the same manner from the north line of Water Street.
Streets not beginning at the base line, further out in the community, will be
numbered according to such hundred block square designated by the grid line
number. (Prior code § 27-6)
12.04.050 Street numbering maps.
   A basic master set of reproducible street numbering maps shall be maintained
by the board of public works and safety and shall be revised necessary to
maintain current status in the future. In conjunction with the master street

hundred feet and shall contain all grid lines and numbers in sequential units
of one hundred. (Prior code § 27-7)
12.04.060 Odd and even numbering systems.
   On each street, odd numbers shall be assigned on the south side and even
numbers on the north side of streets running east and west; odd numbers on the
east side and even numbers on the west side of streets running north and south.
Streets at a forty-five degree angle or less from the north-south longitudinal
line will be numbered as north and south streets. Streets more than forty-five
degrees from the north-south longitudinal line will be numbered as east and
west streets. (Prior code § 27-8)
12.04.070 Procedure for assigning numbers.
   A.   The rule for assigning individual numbers is based on lot frontage. A
number is reserved for each fifteen feet of space or frontage, or fractional
part thereof, whether improved or vacant, and always commences numbering odd or
even consecutively outward from the base lines.
   B.   When a lot or parcel is twenty-five feet, thirty-three feet or forty
feet wide, one to three numbers are reserved. When over thirty feet and up to
sixty feet, two to four numbers are reserved. When property fronts on north or
west aside of streets, even numbers are reserved from each one hundred,
beginning with two. When property fronts on the south or east side of streets,
odd numbers are reserved in the same manner, beginning with one. Numbers are
reserved in that hundred block until all lots between the two grid lines are
numbered, then the next hundred begins. (Prior code § 27-9)
12.04.080 Display of building numbers.
   All owners of buildings within the city are required to cause to be
permanently attached in some public and conspicuous place on the outside of

12.04.090 Composition and design of numbers.
   All numbers assigned in accordance with this chapter shall be of durable,
weather-proof material and of a size not less than one and one-fourth by two
inches. (Prior code § 27-11)
12.04.100 Rules and regulations.
   A.   Numbers will be assigned outward from the zero points in the grid
system to the city plan commission's jurisdictional boundaries, and into
adjacent portions of the county where agreeable.
   B.   House numbers will be assigned in relation to the house location on the
lot or parcel. For example, a three hundred foot lot or parcel would typically
be assigned twenty house numbers and identified by the exact number
representing the placement of the house on the lot or parcel. Street number
assignment shall be based on parcel street frontage.
   C.   Half numbers shall be placed upon the entrance posts or over stairways
on any business buildings or other buildings where occupancy is separate and
distinct from its ground floor.
   D.   All cities and towns within the county, and in adjacent counties if
mutually agreeable, shall be given an opportunity to participate in the
numbering and street naming so that a systematic, coordinated and integrated
system may be achieved throughout the area.
   E.   Streets which curve in several directions will be numbered for the
entire length of the street based upon the major tendency to a north-south or
an east-west direction. A street of variable direction shall carry a name, not
a number.
   F.   Streets which are broken in continuity will be numbered in the same
manner as if they ran continuously.
   G.   Street directions (N., E., S. and W.) shall be included where necessary
on maps and street signs, as a part of the street name.
   H.   Streets shall be identified by street signs to show direction and
displacement of house numbers from base lines.
   I.   On private drives, cul-de-sacs, courts, etc., that are privately
maintained and not dedicated into the public street system, the street name and
numbering system must comply with these principles. A street name and number
must be provided for each apartment house building before delivery service can
be provided.
   J.   When a building has more than one delivery point, a separate number
must be provided for each entrance. If the project includes town house
apartments having separate entrances onto a street or court, each entrance must
have an individual number. A single street number cannot be accepted for a
group of apartment buildings.
   K.   The addresses of streets which now show small gaps or variations in
numbering will not be changed unless the present numbering pattern in confusing
or inconsistent with the overall numbering objectives. (Prior code § 27-12)
12.04.110 Department of code enforcement to verify number.
   The department of code enforcement on being informed of the exact location,
existing or proposed, shall designate and verify to the owner or occupant of
any building now being erected, in the process of construction or hereafter
being erected the correct number of such building. Any decision may be appealed
to the board of public works and safety for review. (Prior code § 27-13)
12.04.120 Bringing suits for injunction.
   The board of public works and safety may institute a suit for injunction in
the circuit or superior court of the county to restrain any person who shall
take down, alter, deface, destroy or conceal any number assigned to or placed
upon any building, or who shall place or substitute or permit to be placed or
substituted an erroneous or improper number upon any building, or who shall
allow an erroneous or improper number upon any building, or who shall allow an
erroneous or improper number to be retained upon any building. Such board may
institute a suit for mandatory injunction directing a person to correct a
building number in violation of the sections of this chapter, or to make the
same comply with its terms. If such board is successful in its suit, the
respondent shall bear the costs of the action including reasonable attorney's
fees. (Prior code § 27-14)
12.04.130 Review by certiorari.
   A decision of the board of public works and safety may be reviewed by
certiorari procedure. A petition for certiorari shall specify the grounds upon
which the petition alleges the illegality of the board's action, and must be
filed in the circuit or superior court of the county within thirty days after
the date of such decision. (Prior code § 27-15)

except as provided in this section. (Ord. 92-48 § 1, 1992; prior code § 33-31)
13.08.220 Water main extensions--Computation of costs.
   Such cost computation as is referred to in Section
13.08.180 and
13.08.190 shall be based upon a six-inch main, unless a larger main is
necessary, in the judgment of the utility, to provide the proposed customer
with the necessary services, including fire protection service; in which event
the cost of such larger main shall be used in computing such cost. If, for the
utility's future extension plans, a larger main than is necessary for the
service required from the main extension involved is proposed to be installed,
the difference in the cost between the larger pipe size installed and the pipe
size required to provide the service, if any, shall be borne by the utility.
Should a prospective customer or developer offer to construct at his sole cost
and expense and to donate to the utility any transmission main extensions or
distribution main extensions necessary to serve the proposed customer, as
described by Section
13.08.200, and should the utility require, for its future extension plans, a
larger main than is necessary, for the service required for the main extension
involved, the utility may enter into a purchase agreement with the proposed
donor to purchase the oversized main; provided, that the purchase price shall
not be paid in whole or in part until such construction shall have been fully
completed and accepted by the utility  under the terms and conditions described
in Section
13.08.200, as if such main were a fully donated main. The purchase price shall
not exceed the difference in cost between the larger pipe size installed and
the pipe size required to provide the service. Any costs to the utility
referred to in this section may be determined from actual bids received by the
utility or may be computed by applying the actual average cost, not reflecting
unusual costs incident to special construction, experienced by the utility
during the preceding twelve-month period, plus or minus any amount necessary to
adjust for known cost increases or decreases, respectively. (Prior code § 33-
32)
13.08.230 Waiver of capacity charge, installation and tap on charges when.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of sections to the contrary, in any areas
outside the corporate limits of the city where the utility service board shall
determine that the water table is lowered as a result of pumping activities by
the municipal water utility to the extent that privately owned water wells in
such areas are affected by such lowered water table, no person applying for
water service to a residence located in any such area shall be required to pay
any assessment, capacity charge, installation or tap on charge in order to
obtain such service, if such residence shall have been constructed or under
construction as of the twenty-second day of January, 1974. The above waiver of
assessment, installation and tap on charges shall in no event discharge or
otherwise change the obligation of each customer to pay the deposit provided
herein and the service rates and charges established for water service. (Ord.
14-2021, 2021; prior code § 33-33)
13.08.240 Fire hydrants--Superintendent of water utility to authorize taking
water--Payment for use.
   No person except those authorized by the superintendent of the municipal
water utility shall take water from any public or private hydrant, street
washer, faucet, hose pipe or fountain except for fire purposes and for the use
of the fire department in case of fire, or in any way use or take water for
private use which is supplied by the municipal water utility, without first
paying for the same and receiving a municipal water utility receipt therefor.
(Prior code § 33-36)
13.08.250 Fire hydrants--Use.
   All pipes or hydrants placed in or about buildings for fire protection must
be used exclusively for fire protection purposes. No attachments connected for
industrial use or any other purpose shall be permitted. (Prior code § 33-37)

aggregate monthly payments made each month and the balance of the aggregate of
such monthly payments shall be credited against the principal due. Prepayment
shall be permitted without penalty. The deferred payments on such assessment
charge shall be evidenced by a promissory note. Such assessment charge shall
not be refunded to the applicant. (Ord. 14-2021, 2021; Ord. 28-2014 § 2, 2014;

upon the final billing. All cash deposits shall be refunded to the depositor
after three years from date of deposit; provided, that satisfactory credit
shall have been established by the depositor, in the opinion of the municipal

13.12.050 Estimated bills.
   The municipal water utility reserves the right to render estimated monthly
water bills to any and all customers based on the average monthly use of such
customers when, after reasonable effort has been made to gain access to the
water meter for the purpose of reading such meter to ascertain the monthly
water service charge on such meter, the meter reading could not be obtained.
(Prior code § 33-10)
13.12.060 Underpayment or overpayment.
   Payment of an estimated water bill does not in any way restrict the right of
the municipal water utility to render corrected water bills covering the period
of time included in the estimated water bills and to collect the proper amounts
as shown by a subsequent reading of the meters, less the amount paid on the
estimated water bills by the customer. If the amount paid on estimated water
bills exceeds the proper amount as computed for a subsequent reading of the
meter or by negotiation, then a proper credit or refund shall be given the
customer involved. (Prior code § 33-11)
13.12.070 Adjusting meters.
   Whenever it is discovered that a meter is not recording correctly,
adjustment shall be made covering such inaccuracy in accordance with such
applicable rules and standards of the public service commission, as may be in

   Bills shall be rendered monthly or quarterly and must be paid at the office
of the municipal water utility during business hours or at such other place or
places as may, from time to time, be determined by the utility service board.
If a bill is not paid within fifteen days from the due date thereof as stated
in the bill, the customer shall be considered delinquent in payment, and the
municipal water utility may, at any time thereafter prior to the payment
thereof after serving notice, turn off and discontinue service. Failure to
receive such bill shall not entitle the customer to a new bill if he fails to
make payment within such fifteen-day period, nor shall it affect the right of
the municipal water utility to turn off and discontinue service for nonpayment
as provided in this section. (Prior code § 33-13)
13.12.090 Refunds.
   Any refund to be made by the municipal water utility to an owner or
developer, as described in this chapter, shall be subordinate to the pledge or
revenues to bondholders of outstanding municipal water utility revenue bonds
and to the pledge of revenues to bondholders of any municipal water utility
revenue bonds which may be issued at any time or, from time to time, in the
future. (Prior code § 33-14)
13.12.100 Refunds not applicable to previous agreements.

of the city, nor shall the terms of any such prior agreements be nullified by
the terms of this chapter. (Prior code § 33-15)

any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste.
   B.   It is unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the city, or
in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any sanitary sewage, industrial
waste or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been
provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter.
   C.   No person shall place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any
unsanitary manner on public or private property within the jurisdiction of the
city, any wastewater or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment
has been provided in accordance with provisions of this chapter and the NPDES
permit.
   D.   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or
opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the utility service board.
   E.   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: 1. for
residential and commercial service; and 2. for service to establishments
producing industrial waste. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the city sewage works. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plan, specifications or other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the director. A permit and
inspection fee of seventy dollars for a residential or commercial building
sewer permit, and seventy dollars for an industrial building sewer permit,
shall be paid at the time the application is filed to the city sewage works.
   F.   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner or the person
installing the building sewer for the owner shall indemnify the city from any
loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by such
installation. The city may require adequate proof of financial responsibility
before issuing a building sewer permit.
   G.   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where two buildings are in close proximity and no private
sewer is available or can be constructed to the second building through an
adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front
building may be extended to the second building and the whole considered as one
building sewer.
   H.   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found on examination and test by the utility service board to
meet all requirements of this chapter.
   I.   The building sewer shall comply in material and workmanship to all
requirements of the Indiana Plumbing Code of Current Adoption (Title 675).
   J.   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, or gravity sewers are not available, sanitary
sewage carried by such drains shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer. The utility service board shall approve all
such devices prior to installation. No water-operated sewage ejector shall be
used.
   K.   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall
be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the utility service board.
Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM
specifications and the Indiana Plumbing Code, except that no backfill shall be
placed until the work has been inspected by the utility service board.
   L.   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight, and
as governed by the Indiana Plumbing Code in effect as of the date of adoption
of this chapter, and any provisions thereof which may be amendatory thereof or
supplemental thereto from time to time hereafter.
   M.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer does not have a properly located "Y" branch, the owner shall
at his expense install an approved tapping saddle in the public sewer at the
location specified by the utility service board. The tapping saddle shall be
installed in a neatly tapped hole cut into the public sewer; the connection
between the tapping saddle and public sewer shall be secured by the use of
epoxy compound. The center line of the building sewer at the tapping saddle
shall be at or above the center line of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint
shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight. Special fittings
may be used for the connection only when approved by the utility service board.
   1.   House connection laterals will be provided under the rules of 40 CFR
402 where public sewers are separated from property lines by adjacent public
rights-of-way. Once the building sewer is connected to these lines, the entire
line is considered as a building sewer to its connection point with the
mainline sewer and is the maintenance responsibility of the property owner.
   N.   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the utility
service board twenty-four hours in advance of when the building sewer is ready
for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made
under the supervision of the utility service board or its representative.
   O.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall comply to all
other local ordinances and procedures for work within the public right-of-way.

13.16.030 Prohibited discharge.
   No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any
pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These
general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW, whether or not they are
subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or
local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   A.   Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
   1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (sixty degrees Celsius) using
the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
   2.   Wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or more than 11.0, or otherwise
causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
   3.   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of
the flow in the POTW resulting in interference;
   4.   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with
the POTW;
   5.   Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty degrees
Fahrenheit (sixty-five degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological
activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (forty degrees Celsius);
   6.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil
origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;
   7.   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems;
   8.   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at the discharge points designated
by the utility service board;
   9.   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to
create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance or repair;
   10.   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently impart color to the treatment plant's
effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit;
   11.   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
   12.   Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof

water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the utility service board;
   13.   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
   14.   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the utility
service board in a wastewater discharge permit;
   15.   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the
treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test;
   16.   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause
excessive foaming in the POTW;
   17.   Any wastes containing fats, 300 mg/1 Polar, 100 mg/1 Non-Polar, wax,
grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l. This 100 mg/
l shall be given as non-polar oil and grease as defined in the latest edition
of standard methods, and interpreted to mean petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable
cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that could cause
interference or a pass through condition at the wastewater treatment plant;
   18.   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation and
operation of any garbage grinder (other than in a residence) may be subject to
the review and approval of the utility service board.
   19.   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or
concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not;
   20.   Unusual concentrations of inert, suspended solids (such as, but not
limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residuals) or of dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate); or
   21.   Any wastewater causing the treatment plant to fail a toxicity test.
   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not
be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the
POTW.
   B.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471
are hereby incorporated.
   1.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the utility
service board may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   2.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the utility service board
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
   3.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
   4.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   C.   The utility service board may reject any discharge to the POTW, in
whole or part, that it determines to have the potential to either adversely
effect POTW operations or cause or contribute to a violation of the city's
NPDES permit.
   D.   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial user.
Furthermore, no special agreement or arrangement shall allow any industrial
user to discharge pollutants in excess of the maximum allowable headworks
loading (MAHL) of the POTW or conventional pollutants, which will exceed the
POTW's designed capacity.
   E.   The utility service board may impose mass limitations in addition to,
or in place of, any local limit established by this chapter. The mass limits
shall not allow any industrial user to discharge pollutants in excess of the
maximum allowable headworks loading (MAHL) of the POTW or conventional
pollutants, which will exceed the POTW's designed capacity. Furthermore, the
mass limit shall not be less stringent than federal or state requirements.
   F.   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the parameters listed below. The following limits apply to the total
for any non-domestic discharge prior to entering the city sewage collection
system or at the sampling manhole:

   1.   Dischargers shall meet the most stringent discharge limitation,
federal, state or local.
   G.   The utility service board may develop best management practices (BMPs),
by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local
limits and the requirements of subsection
13.16.030(A).
   H.   Except as indicated below, the user must collect wastewater samples
using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow
proportional sampling is infeasible, the utility service board may authorize
the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples, where
the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   1.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   I.   The city shall assess charges for fees and fines to industrial users of
the POTW to compensate the city for the cost of administration of the
pretreatment program. The city may adopt charges and fees which may include,
but are not limited to:
   1.   Application fees for discharge permits.
   2.   Application fees for construction permits.
   3.   Fees charged to industries, monitoring.
   4.   Fees charged to industries, inspections.
   5.   Surcharges for high strength or high volume wastes.
   6.   Fees for filing appeals.
   7.   Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction.
   8.   Fees for investigating and processing notices of violations.
   9.   Fines for discharge of non-compatible waste.
   J.   The city may establish, in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to
comply with the intent of this chapter.
   K.   Effluent limitations are based on the most stringent level, whether
federal, state or local. Local limits are evaluated with each NPDES permit
renewal.
   L.   The control authority may develop equivalent mass and concentration
limits in lieu of production-based standards. A further explanation of this
method is given in 40 CFR 403.6.
   M.   Any industrial user wishing to change a compliance monitoring point
from end of process to end of pipe may do so with the approval of the utility
service board. Limitations in this situation will be determined by the Combined
Wastestream Formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)).
   1.   Stormwater and demineralizer backwash may be considered "unregulated
waste streams".
   2.   Samples must be flow-proportioned where only non-regulated waste
streams are combined after treatment but prior to the monitoring/control point.
   N.   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in subsection A of this
section within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the
city, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before such facilities
are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of
this chapter.
   1.   Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to
pretreatment or control facilities shall be submitted for approval of the city
and the state of Indiana, and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until approval, in writing, is granted. Where such facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operating order by the owner at his expense, and shall be subject to periodic
inspection by the city to determine that such facilities are being operated in
conformance with applicable federal, state and local laws and permits.
   O.   The utility service board shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
Users shall allow the utility service board ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   1.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the utility service board will be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   2.   The utility service board shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   3.   The utility service board may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
   4.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the utility service board, and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   5.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the utility service board access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   P.   The installation, operation and maintenance of the flow measuring and
sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the
wastes and shall be subject to the approval of the utility service board. When
required by the utility service board, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the utility service board. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
   Q.   Fats, grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the utility service board, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be
of a type and capacity approved by the utility service board, and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Provided; however, that approval of any such interceptors by the utility
service board shall not relieve any person of the responsibility of complying
with the discharge requirements of this chapter.
   R.   Fats, grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and
watertight.
   S.   Where installed, all fats, grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at
all times.
   T.   The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes having: 1.
a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter by weight; or 2. containing more than two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter by weight of suspended solids; or 3. containing any quantity of
substance having the characteristics described in subsection B of this section;
or 4. having an average daily flow greater than five percent of the average
daily sewage flow of the city, shall be subject to the review and approval of
the utility service board. Where necessary in the opinion of the utility
service board, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary
treatment as may be necessary to: 1. reduce the BOD to two hundred fifty
milligrams per liter and the suspended solids to two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter by weight; or 2. reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents
to within the maximum limits provided in subsection B of this section; or 3.
control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans,
specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed
preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the
utility service board and of the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until
such approval is obtained in writing.
   U.   Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation, by the owner at his expense.
   V.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in subsection B of this section shall be
determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136.
   W.   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the sewage works. Any person
violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of
disorderly conduct.
   X.   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.

13.16.050 Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
   The utility service board shall evaluate whether each industrial user needs
an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The utility service board may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the utility service board
may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/control slug plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   B.   Description of stored chemicals;
   C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug
discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the prohibited discharges in Section
13.16.030(A);
   D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage area, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

13.16.070 Hauled wastewater.
   A.   The utility service board may require septic tank waste haulers to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. Additionally, the utility service board
may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge, or the utility service board may collect samples of each hauled load
to ensure compliance with this chapter. Waste haulers may be required by the
utility service board to provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This
form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler,
permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste,
and volume and characteristics of waste.
   A.   Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are
established by the utility service board, provided such wastes do not violate
this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city.
   B.   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial septage"
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the city. The
utility service board shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such
wastes, if such disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operation.
Waste haulers are subject to all other sections of this chapter.

13.16.090 Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
   It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge
wastewater into the Columbus POTW without first obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit from the city. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions discussed in the
enforcement response guide listed in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with
all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law. The utility service board may
require other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, to obtain
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this
chapter.

13.16.190 Reporting.
   A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in this
chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the
case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the city,
shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless the
discharger chooses to do self-monitoring for high-strength surcharges of which
the timetable would be monthly, a report indicating the nature and
concentration, of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flow
during the reporting period. Flow shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement; provided, however, where cost feasibility considerations justify,
the city may accept reports of average and maximum daily flows estimated by
verifiable techniques. The city, for good cause shown considering such factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating
factors, may authorize the submission of such reports on months other than
those specified above. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires
compliance with a best management practice (or pollution prevention
alternative), the user shall submit documentation required by the control
authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user.
   B.   All wastewater user reports must be signed by an authorized
representative of the user and contain the following information:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information.
   C.   Within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty days after the final
administrative decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing
industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW will be required
to submit to the city a report containing the information listed in paragraph
(b)(1)-(7) of 40 CFR 403.12(b).
   D.   Upon promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard, the city will
provide the appropriate form to the dischargers who are affected by the
promulgated standard. The dischargers are then required to submit the completed
report to the city.
   E.   Within either one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the utility service board a report which contains the
information listed in subsection F, below. At least ninety days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the utility service board a report which contains the
information listed in subsection F, below. A new source shall report the method
of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A
new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.
   F.   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
   1.   Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
   2.   Environmental Permits. A list of any environmental control permits held
by or for the facility.
   3.   Description of Operations. A brief description of the nature, average
rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s)
carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process
diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
processes.
   4.   Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 4016(e).
   5.   Measurement of Pollutants.
   a.   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated
process.
   b.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and
concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the utility
service board, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or
mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of
daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
subsection
13.16.030(T) of this chapter.
   c.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in
subsection
13.16.030(H) of this chapter.

representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
   7.   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for
the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this
section must meet the requirements set out in Sections
13.16.200 and
13.16.210 of this chapter.
   8.   Signature and Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with this section.
   G.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the city. The frequency of monitoring
by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard in the discharger's wastewater permit. All analyses shall be performed
in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto.
   H.   Such measurements, test and analysis shall be made at the user's
expense. If made by the city, an appropriate charge may be assessed to the user
at the option of the city.
   I.   Self-monitoring reports from a categorical SIU must be signed by an
authorized representative, as defined in Section
13.16.010 of this chapter.
   J.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's entire
process discharge. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any pollutant at the designated sampling location more
frequently than required by the utility service board, using the procedures
prescribed in subsection G above, the results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   K.   Each user must notify the utility service board of any planned
significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the
nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ten days before the
change.
   1.   The utility service board may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application.
   2.   The utility service board may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
Section
13.16.130 of this chapter, or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under Section
13.16.150 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   3.   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent or greater, and the discharge
of any previously unreported pollutants.
   L.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the
user shall immediately telephone and notify the utility service board of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user.
   1.   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the utility service board, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   2.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection L, above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   3.   Users are required to notify the utility service board immediately of
any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
   M.   Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations which places
the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter shall
inform the city thereof within twenty-four hours of first awareness of the
commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written
follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger with the city within
five days. The report shall specify:
   1.   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact on a
discharger's compliance status.
   2.   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
   3.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   4.   A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall be an
affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the city against a
discharger for any noncompliance with this chapter, which arises out of
violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset.
   N.   Bypass.
   1.   For the purposes of this subsection:
   a.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
   b.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   2.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.
   3.   Bypass Notifications.
   a.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the utility service board, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
   b.   A user shall submit oral notice to the utility service board of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utility service board may waive the
written report, on a case-by-case basis, if the oral report has been received
within twenty-four hours.
   4.   Bypass
   a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the utility service board may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
   i.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
   ii.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
   iii.   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this
subsection.
   b.   The utility service board may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the utility service board determines that
it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this
subsection.

13.16.200 Compliance schedule progress report.
   The following conditions shall apply to compliance schedule reporting:
   A.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   B.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
   C.   The user shall submit a report to the utility service board no later
than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
   D.   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the utility service board.

13.16.210 Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
   Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Columbus city utilities a report containing information on flow
measurement, measurement of pollutants and certification. Industrial users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance
with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), shall contain a reasonable measure of
the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified only by certain corporate officers or authorized representatives
designated by the utility service board. The compliance report shall follow the
format listed in Section
13.16.190.

(Ord. 10-12 (part), 2010)
13.16.240 Recordkeeping.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices established under subsection
13.16.030(G). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates the
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the utility service board.
(Ord. 10-12 (part), 2010)
13.16.250 Notice of violation--Repeat sampling and reporting.
   A.   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
industrial user must notify the control authority within twenty-four hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
control authority within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. The
industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at
the industrial user's at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling
between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user
receives the results of this sampling. Where the control authority has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control
authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis, unless it informs the
user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.
   B.   The strength of wastewaters shall be determined, for periodic
establishment of charges provided for in the rate ordinance, from samples taken
at the aforementioned structure at any period of time and of such duration and
in such manner as the city may elect, or, at any place mutually agreed upon
between the user and the city. Appropriate charges for sampling and analysis
may be assessed to the user at the option of the city. The results of routine
sampling and analysis by the user may also be used, for determination of
charges after verification by the city.
(Ord. 10-12 (part), 2010; Ord. 99-16 (part), 1999)
13.16.260 Confidentiality.
   A.   Information and data furnished to the city with respect to the nature
and frequency of discharge will be made available to the EPA and IDEM, or any
other governmental agency without restriction. Information and data furnished
to the city with respect to nature and frequency of discharge will be made
available to the public, unless the discharger specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger.
   B.   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes will not be made
available for inspection by the public, but will only be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to the ordinance, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal
system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report will be available for use by any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
(Ord. 10-12 (part), 2010; Ord. 99-16 (part), 1999)
13.16.270 Enforcement.
   A.   All dischargers subject to local, state or federal regulations must
retain and preserve, for at least three years, any records books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries relating to
monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger
in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which
are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city
must be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement
activities have concluded and all periods of limitation concerning any appeals
have expired.
   1.   The city may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment
service to a discharger when it appears to the city that an actual or
threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to
the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment,
interferes with the operation of the POTW, or violates any pretreatment limits
imposed by this chapter. In the event such discharge poses an immediate threat
to the collection works, POTW or the health and safety of any persons, the city
shall have the right, as given in the enforcement response procedures, to
immediately terminate service. In the event a discharger does not pose an
immediate threat, the city may, at its discretion, suspend services. Any
discharger notified of the suspension of the city's wastewater treatment
service shall, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the city,
cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the discharger to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the city shall
commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's
compliance with such order. The city shall reinstate the wastewater treatment
service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the discharger of
the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions as set forth in
this chapter.
   2.   The city may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to any
discharger which fails to: a. factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge; b. report significant changes in wastewater
constituents or characteristics; c. refuses reasonable access to the
discharger's premises by representatives of the city for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or d. violates the conditions of this chapter, or any
final judicial order entered with respect thereto.
   3.   Whenever the city finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
which justifies termination of a wastewater treatment service, the city shall
serve or cause to be served upon such discharger, a written notice, either
personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within thirty days of the date of
receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond personally or in writing to
the city, advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter,
the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   4.   Where the violation of paragraph (A)(1) of this section is not
corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the city
may order any discharger which causes or allows conduct prohibited by paragraph
(A)(1), to show cause, before the city or its duly authorized representative,
why the proposed service termination action should not be taken. A written
notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service, certified or
registered, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a
hearing to be held by the city or its designee regarding the violation, the
reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement
action, and directing the discharger to show cause before the city or its
designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of a discharger.
The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the city which shall then
enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the
discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the discharger in accordance
with applicable local or state law.
   5.   Following the entry of any order by the city with respect to the
conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of paragraph (A)(1), the
attorney for the city may, following the authorization of such action by the
city, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in an
appropriate court.
   6.   The control authority shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper published in the municipality in which the city is located, a list of
the industrial users which, during the previous twelve months, were in
significant noncompliance, as defined in Section 13.16.101, with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance"
is defined in the definitions section of this chapter.
   7.   Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request,
in writing, an interpretation or ruling by the city on matters of performance
or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity relating to an
alleged violation is the subject. Receipt of a discharger's request shall stay
all enforcement proceedings, pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply.
   8.   Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this chapter may
be taken in accordance with applicable local and state law.
   9.   When the utility service board finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the utility service board may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within the time frame stated in the Letter of Violation
(LOV), an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the utility service board. Submission of this plan
in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the utility service board to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
   B.   Any discharger who is found to have violated an order of the city, or
who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the
regulations, or rules of the city, or orders of any court of competent
jurisdiction, or permits issued hereunder, shall commit an ordinance violation
and be subject to a civil penalty of up to two thousand five hundred dollars.
Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   C.   Any discharger violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who
discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the city wastewater disposal system, shall be liable to
the city for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge.
The city shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the city for any
cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge.
Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter
enforceable under the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or wastewater discharge
permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall commit an
ordinance violation and be subject to a civil penalty of up to two thousand
five hundred dollars.
   E.   Any person found to be violating any provision of Article II of this
chapter shall be served by the city with written notice, stating the nature of
the violation, and shall be required to formally reply to this citation.
   F.   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be
fined in the amount not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars for each
violation. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed
a separate offense.
   G.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become
liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city or
downstream users by reason of such violation.
   H.   The utility service board shall have full power to invoke any
authorized legal, equitable or special remedy for the enforcement of this
chapter. Further, the utility service board is authorized to institute
proceedings in the Circuit or Superior Court of Bartholomew County for
prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief of any violation of this chapter.
   I.   Any discharger violating the maximum limit given for non-compatible
pollutants may be subject to administrative fines as established by the utility
service board.

13.20.010 Definitions.
   Definitions listed in Section 13.16.010 shall apply to this chapter, and
shall include the following:
   "Normal domestic sewage" (for the purpose of determining surcharges) means
wastewater or sewage having an average daily concentration as follows:
          BOD not more than 344 mg/l
          S.S. not more than 248 mg/l
          Phosphorus not more than 11 mg/l
          NH3-N not more than 27 mg/l
          Freon trichloroerifluorethane soluble matter (oil and grease) not
more than 100 mg/l
   As defined by origin, wastewaters from segregated domestic and/or sanitary
conveniences as distinct from wastes from industrial processes. (Prior code §
26-96)
13.20.020 Classification of charges.
   Every  person whose premises are served by the sewage works shall be charged
for the services provided. These charges are established for each user class,
as defined, in order that the sewage works shall recover, from each user and
user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the treatment works in
terms of volume and load. User charges are levied to defray the cost of
operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works. User
charges shall be uniform in magnitude within a user class.
   A.   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, published in the Federal
Register August 21, 1973 (38 CFR 22523) and on February 11, 1974 (39 CFR 5252).
Replacement costs, which are recovered through the system of user charges,
shall be based upon the expected service life of the sewage works plant and
equipment.
   B.   The various classes of users of the treatment works for the purposes of
this chapter, shall be as follows:
   Class I:    Residential — single-family only.
   Class II:    All other — which includes:
   1.   Multiple-family dwellings (on a single meter);
   2.   Commercial:
   3.   Governmental;
   4.   Institutional;
   5.   Wholesale residential.   Class III:Industrial. (Prior code § 26-97)
13.20.030 Assessment charges.
   A.   Each applicant for sewage service hereafter who shall be connected to a
sewer primary main or secondary main of the sewage works, shall be required to
pay the sewage works an assessment charge equal to thirteen dollars and ten
cents per lineal foot of the applicant's lot or land abutting thereon.
   B.   Exceptions. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply however,
to the following:
      1.   Applicants whose lot or land is served by a donated sewer main
extension;
      2.   Applicants for service for lots or parcels of land which have
already been assessed under Barrett Law proceedings or assessed and paid under
board of works proceedings for a local sewer adjacent to their property;
      3.   Applicants served by lots which were the subject of an agreement
dated before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section
providing for a deposit and subsequent refund.
   C.   If no part, or an unusual part, in the judgment of the sewer works, of
the applicant's lot or land shall abut said sewer primary main or secondary
main, such applicant shall be required to pay the sewage works an assessment
charge as shall be determined to be fair and equitable in the sole judgment of
the sewage works.
   D.   Such assessment charge described above shall be in addition to the
service rates and charges established for sewer service.
   E.   Payment of assessment charge. Such assessment charge shall be paid in
full before construction of such sewer primary main or secondary main is
commenced, if such construction shall be required to provide such sewer
service, and before sewer service will be furnished by the sewage works except
as follows:
      1.   If the property owner shall make application to the sewage works for
a residential service account, then at the time application for such service is
made, or on or before the date such property owner shall be required to connect
to the sewer system of the sewage works, the sewage works may permit such
assessment charge, with interest as herein provided, to be paid in a maximum of
one hundred twenty equal, consecutive monthly payments, which include principal
and interest, commencing before connection is made. Interest is to be computed
monthly, upon the principal sum unpaid at the beginning of each monthly period.
The rate of interest is to be that rate in effect at the time of application,
as established by the utility service board from time to time. Prepayments, in
whole or in part, shall be permitted without penalty. The deferred payments on
such assessment charge shall be evidenced by a promissory note.
   F.   Such assessment charge shall not be refunded to the applicant.
   G.   Penalty for unlawful connections. It is unlawful for anyone to make
connection to a sewage works' primary line or secondary line without first
making application for connection and complying with the provisions of this
section. Violators shall be subject to a penalty of twice their assessment
charge plus twice the minimum monthly sewage rate for the period involved.
Anyone using the services of the sewage works and not paying for such services,
or not reporting the use of such services, as of the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this section, shall be subject to a penalty of twice the
assessment charge plus twice the minimum monthly sewage rate for the period
from the date of said ordinance.
   H.   State Board of Health. All sewer main extensions, whether made by the
sewage works or by developers who subsequently donate such sewer mains to the
sewage works, shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Indiana State Board of Health and all other necessary
regulatory bodies and must be approved by such bodies.

13.20.040 Sewage rates.
   A.   The need to maintain high quality wastewater, meet the state and
federal standards all the while providing continued operational and maintenance
costs and providing for future projects and system improvements necessitates a
modification of the wastewater rates and service fees.
   B.   The new wastewater rate schedule is as follows:
There shall be a fixed monthly rate, deemed a base charge, that is based upon
the size of the water meter supplying water to any user of the sewer service of
Columbus city utilities:

* In the instances where sewer volumetric usage is separately metered and is
significantly different from drinking water volumetric usage or where a water
meter size is not available, the utility will establish an equivalent water
meter size to be used in the monthly sewer base charge. The equivalent water
meter size will be based upon the metered or expected sewer volumetric usage
for the customer.

payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   C.   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of ten percent of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at twenty days after the date of mailing of the
bill.
   D.   The municipal wastewater utility shall require from all applicants for
residential service a cash deposit of not less than twenty dollars and from all
applicants for other than residential service a cash deposit in such amount as
shall equal to sixty days revenue, as estimated by the municipal wastewater
utility, but not less than twenty dollars as a guarantee against the nonpayment
of bills for service; except, that if the applicant is the legal title owner of
real estate whose credit is approved by the municipal wastewater utility, the
municipal wastewater utility may waive such cash deposits. Such cash deposits
minus any unpaid amounts for service rendered the customer shall be returned to
the depositor upon the final billing. All cash deposits be remitted to
depositors on termination of service. (Ord. 94-33 § 1, 1994; prior code § 26-
101)
13.20.080 Studies.
   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and
equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various
users of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made within a
reasonable period of time following the first twelve months of operation,
following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. Such study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user
classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its
revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance,
replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste
treatment systems.
   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time following
the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to be made
for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and charges
for sewage services on a continuing basis. Said studies shall be conducted by a
firm of certified public accountants, which firm shall have experience in such
studies. (Prior code § 26-102)

the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city of Columbus
through the reduction of pollutants in stormwater discharges and the regulation
of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent
practicable. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction
of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit process and specifically meet the requirements of 327 IAC 15-13.
The objectives of this chapter are:
   A.   To regulate pursuant to 327 IAC 15-13 the contribution of pollutants to
the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any
user;
   B.   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system;
   C.   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter; and
   D.   To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper
discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, grease,
oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste,
sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system. (Ord. 08-26,

suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or other watercourses. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or other watercourses, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   B.   Termination due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would, in the judgment of the authorized
enforcement agency, abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized
enforcement agency will notify the violator of the proposed termination of
their MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency
for a post-termination hearing regarding the termination of access. Such
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with rules promulgated by the
authorized enforcement agency. A person commits a violation of this chapter if
the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this
section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. (Ord.

during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause.
(Ord. 08-26, 2008; Ord. 06-11, 2006)
13.22.110   Access and inspection of properties and facilities.
   A.   Whenever the city has cause to believe that there exists, or
potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a
violation of this chapter, the city or its agent shall have the right to enter
the premises at any reasonable time to determine if the discharger is complying
with all requirements of this chapter. The city or its agent shall be permitted
to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If the
facility has security measures in force that require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the person in control of such
premises shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. In the event that the
owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter has been made, the
city is hereby empowered to seek assistance from a court of competent
jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. If a discharge is observed which
represents an immediate hazard to public health or safety, or aquatic life, the
city, a department of law enforcement, a department of fire and rescue
services, and any other agent of the city, may enter any property or structure,
except a dwelling, as necessary to prevent or stop the hazard.

by the use of best management practices.
   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through
the use of structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible
for premises, which are, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal
separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) or stormwater management plan (SWMP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 08-26,
2008; Ord. 06-11, 2006)
13.22.150   Notification of spills.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for any premises, facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release
of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the municipal separate storm sewer
system, or other watercourses, said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of
such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify
the city or its appointed agent in person or by phone no later than twenty-four
hours. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the city at City of Columbus, City Engineer's Office,
123 Washington Street, Columbus, IN 47201, within five calendar days of the
phone or in person notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years. (Ord. 08-26, 2008; Ord. 06-11, 2006)

13.26.010 Findings and purpose.
   A.   Findings. The city council of the City of Columbus finds that:
   1.   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non-agricultural uses including but not limited to the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings, and industrial plants,
the building of roads and streets, and the creation of recreational facilities;
   2.   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs;
   3.   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes and has resulted in the deterioration of the water resources of the
city.
   4.   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting in
increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
   5.   Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this
chapter and implementing the same will address many of the detrimental effects
associated with land development;
   6.   Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the soils
and topography of city as well as the public health, safety and welfare; and
   7. The city has the authority to adopt an stormwater management ordinance
pursuant to I.C. 36-1-3 and so that city may comply with requirements of 327
IAC 15-13.
   8.   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and may increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff may contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation
of stormwater runoff from development sites.
   9.   Therefore, the city council established this set of water quality and
quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide a reasonable
guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff to protect local water
resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater
runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and non-point source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
mitigate threats to public health and safety.
   B.   Purpose. The city council hereby declares that the purpose of this
chapter is to replace and supercede Ordinance 21-06 with a new ordinance. This
new ordinance then will re-establish minimum erosion and sediment control
requirements; establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls
to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public
by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and
maintenance of any development or other land altering activity which disturbs
or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth within the
defined boundaries of the city and as specified herein. This chapter seeks to
meet that purpose through the following objectives:
   1.   Manage stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce
flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank erosion
and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
   2.   Minimize non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
development, which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   3.   Manage the total volume of surface water runoff, which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
   4. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-point
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose a
minimal threat to public safety.
   5.   Adopt a stormwater design manual as recommended by the city engineer
and adopted through the board of public works for specific design
considerations to perform above activities. Said manuals to be modified through
the board of public works as needed and recommended by the city engineer.

greater than fifty percent in ultra-urban areas, and up to 100 percent in some
cases. These impervious surfaces can provide an effective environment to
collect and accumulate constituents from atmospheric deposition, vehicular
traffic, or other sources. Figure 1 illustrates these changes in runoff
resulting from increased impervious area. High runoff conditions efficiently
transport many water quality constituents. Several factors have been identified
as major influences on the types of constituents and their concentrations in
urban runoff. Among these are site-specific characteristics, such as land use
practices. Ultra-urban areas typically contain higher population densities.
These areas exhibit high levels of trash and debris, which tend to clog
stormwater control structures arid pollute receiving streams. In addition, the
pets of the people living in ultra-urban areas are a potential concern since
they deposit fecal matter in the urban environment. This fecal matter is washed
off during storm events and contributes pathogenic bacteria to stormwater
runoff.

the runoff from the first one-inch of rainfall.
   “Unimproved lot” means a lot that has infrastructure brought close enough to
its boundary that could allow structures to be built for human work, storage,
habitation, or recreation and has not been improved with structures for human
work, storage, habitation, or recreation.
   “Work day” means a calendar day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and City
recognized holidays.

13.26.030 Applicability and general principles.
   A.   This chapter shall be applicable to major subdivisions; site plan
reviews not part of a major subdivision with current storm water management
plan approval; and building permits for sites disturbing more than one acre
that are not part of a major subdivision or site plan review with current storm
water management plan approval.
   B.   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in Article U of this chapter, decisions on
permitting and on-site stormwater shall be governed by special stormwater
sizing criteria found in the stormwater design manual.
   C.   It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by development activities within the city. Measures taken
to control erosion and sedimentation as adopted by
13.26.050 should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from
the site by a storm event. The following principles shall apply to all
development activities within the city's jurisdiction and to the preparation of
the submissions required under
13.26.040.
   1.   Development should be related to the existing topography and soils of
the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible,
and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   2.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left unaltered
wherever possible.
   3.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   4.   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff
waters from land altering activity or development.
   5.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved.
   6.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   7.   Provisions should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
of discharge will not create additional erosion.
   8.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development.
   9.   Post construction measures should be considered for their ability to
provide long-term reduction in associated pollutant loading of the waterways.
(Ord. 08-29, 2008)
13.26.040 Storm water management plan approval.
   A.   Approval required. Storm water management plan approval is required
from the City Engineer's office for major subdivisions; site plan reviews not
part of a major subdivision with current storm water management plan approval;
building permits for sites disturbing more than one acre that are not part of a
major subdivision or site plan review with current storm water management plan
approval.

the land alteration of less than one acre of total land area as determined
under division 5. and are not part of a larger common plan of development or
sale.
   2.   For off-site construction activities, which are under the direct
control of the applicant and provide services (i.e. road extensions, sewer,
water, and other utilities) to a project site, these off-site activity areas
must be considered a part of the project site.
   3.   For an individual lot where land alteration is expected to be one acre
or more and the lot lies within a project site approved under this chapter, the
individual lot owner shall:
   a.   Complete his/her own notice of intent letter (NOD; and
   b.   Ensure that a sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted
in accordance with division C..
   4.   For an individual lot where the land alteration is less than one acre
and the lot lies within a project site approved under this chapter, the
individual lot operator shall:
   a.   Comply with:

plan developed by the project site owner; and
   ii.   327 1AC 15-5-7.5.
   b.   Not be required to submit a notice of intent letter and construction
plans.
   5.   Multi-lot project sites are regulated by this chapter in accordance
with the following:
   a.   A determination of the area of land alteration shall be calculated by
adding the total area of land alteration for improvements such as roads,
utilities, or common areas, and the expected total alteration on each
individual lot, as determined by the following:
   i.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are one-
half acre or more, one-half acre of land alteration must be used as the
expected lot alteration.
   ii.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are less
than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being altered.
   iii.   To calculate lot alteration on all other types of project sites, such
as industrial and commercial project sites, the following apply:
   •   Where lots are one acre or greater in size, a minimum of one acre of
land alteration must be calculated as the expected lot alteration.
   •   Where the lots are less than one acre in size, the total lot must be
calculated as being altered.
   b.   For purposes of this chapter, strip developments:
   i.   Are considered as one project site; and
   ii.   Must comply with this chapter;
unless the total combined alteration on all individual lots is less than one
acre and is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
   6.   Submittal of a notice of intent and construction plans is not required
for construction activities associated with a single-family residential
dwelling altering less than one acre when the dwelling is not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale.

experience.
(Ord. 08-29, 2008)
13.26.100 General performance criteria for stormwater management.
   The following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater
management at all sites:
   A.   All site designs shall establish stormwater BMP's to control the peak
flow rate of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and
reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize
pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff
from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the
maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and
quantity.
   B.   Stormwater runoff generated from new developments shall not discharge
untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body
without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method in the Stormwater
Design Manual.
   C.   For new developments, structural stormwater BMP's shall be designed to
remove 80% of the average annual post development total suspended solids load
(TSS) at the initial flows. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this
performance standard if it is: Sized to capture the prescribed water quality
volume (WQv), Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in the stormwater design manual, constructed properly, and maintained
adequately and regularly.
   D.   To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current stormwater
design manual.
   E.   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(Division of Nature Preserve check part B) (i.e., cold water fisheries,
shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may
be subject to additional performance criteria based on minimum state of Indiana
water quality standards for the specific receiving water.
   F.    The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the stormwater
design manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
(Ord. 08-29, 2008)
13.26.110 Basic stormwater management design criteria.
   A.   Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will
be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (such as
recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten year, one hundred year) as
identified in the current stormwater design manual are met.
   B.   Site Design Feasibility. Stormwater BMP's for a site shall be chosen
based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
   1.   Topography.
   2.   Maximum Drainage Area.
   3.   Depth to Water Table.
   4.   Soils.
   5.   Slopes.
   6.   Terrain.
   7.   Head.
   8.   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or ultra-
urban areas.
   9.   Applicants shall consult the stormwater design manual for guidance on
the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater
management practice.
   C.   Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be
designed to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in the
volume and rate of discharge. This shall include, but not be limited to:
   1.   Maximizing flow paths from inflow points to outflow points,
   2.   Protection of inlet and outfall structures,
   3.   Elimination of erosive flow velocities, and
   4.   Providing underdrain systems, where applicable.
   The Stormwater Design Manual shall provide detailed guidance on the
requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management
practices.
   D.   Pretreatment Requirements
Every stormwater treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water
quality pretreatment; in accordance with the pretreatment requirements found in
the stormwater design Stormwater Design Manual.
   E.   Treatment/Geometry Conditions
All stormwater management practices shall be designed to capture and treat
stormwater runoff according to the specifications outlined in the Storwater
Design Manual. These specifications will designate the water quantity and
quality treatment criteria that apply to an approved stormwater management
practice.
   F.   Vegetation plans required. All stormwater management practices must
have a plan detailing the type of vegetation to be planted in the practice
area, how will it be maintained, and who will manage arid maintain this
vegetation. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect.
   G.   Maintenance agreements. All stormwater management practices shall have
an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed. This agreement will include all maintenance easements
required to access and inspect the stormwater management practices and access
to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
practice.
   H.   Non-structural stormwater practices. The use of non-structural
stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance
on structural practices. Credit can be earned, in the form of reductions, when
nonstructural management practices are utilized to reduce the stormwater runoff
generated from the site because of the proposed construction activity. Non-
structural practices are explained in detail in the current design manual and
applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must
ensure that these management practices are documented, remain unaltered, and
binding to subsequent property owners.
(Ord. 08-29, 2008)
13.26.120 Requirements for stormwater management plan approval.
   A.   Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No
application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater
management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality
impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. A
licensed professional engineer or a licensed landscape architect must prepare
this plan. The plan must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or
off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of management
practices. The applicant must address any comments or issues raised by the city
or state government in the final stormwater management plan. This final plan
must be signed by a licensed professional engineer (PE), who will verify that
the design of all stormwater management practices meet the requirements
outlined in the stormwater design manual. No building, grading, or sediment

evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site. Other items
that will be reviewed are the potential present and future impacts of the
proposed development on the water resources affected by such development and
the effectiveness of the proposed measures to manage the stormwater runoff from
the project site. The intent of this conceptual planning process is to
determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed
project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from
the proposed development. To accomplish this goal the following information
shall be included in the concept plan:
   1.   A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural stormwater management
and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed

the commencement of the project, a description of the watershed and its
relation to the project site. This description should include a discussion of
soil conditions, forest cover, topography, wetlands, and other native
vegetative areas on the site. Particular attention should be paid to
environmentally sensitive features (i.e. fishery, wetlands) that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development.
   4.   A written description of the required maintenance for any proposed BMP.
   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed site,
an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept plan
measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the site in
accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
   C.   Final stormwater management plan requirements. After review of the
stormwater management concept plan and modifications to that plan as deemed
necessary by the engineering department, a final stormwater management plan

addition to the information from the concept plan, shall include all of the
information required in the stormwater design manual. This includes:
   1. Contact information. The name, address, and telephone number of all
persons having a legal interest in the property and the tax reference number
and parcel number of the property or properties affected.
   2.   Topographic Base Map. A one inch = two hundred feet topographic base
map of the site. The map must extend a minimum of two thousand, five hundred
feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicate existing
surface water drainage including streams, ponds, culverts, ditches, and
wetlands; current land use including all existing structures; locations of
utilities, roads, and easements; and significant natural and manmade features
not otherwise shown.
   3. Calculations. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre-

   i.   Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test
results.
   4.   Soils information. If the proposed control measure depends on the
hydrologic properties of soils (for example, infiltration basins), then a soils
report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site boring
logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of the required soil borings
or soil sits shall be determined based on the information needed to determine
the suitability and distribution of the soil types present at the location of
the control measure.
   5.   BMP O & M manual maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning
of all stormwater management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and
repair procedures to ensure their continued functionality as included in both

   A.   Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the
engineering department in advance before the commencement of construction in
writing. (Note sample form letter). The staff of the engineering department
shall conduct regular inspections of the stormwater management system
construction. All inspections shall be documented in written reports that
contain the following information:
   1.   The date and location of the inspection;
   2.   Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater
management plan;
   3.   Variations from the approved construction specifications;
   4.   Any violations that exist.
   If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing
of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added
work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously
completed has received approval by the Engineering Department.
   B.   As built plans. All applicants are required to submit "as built" plans
for any stormwater management practices located on-site after final
construction is completed. The plan must show the final design and
specifications for all stormwater management facilities. These plans must be
signed and sealed by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the
Engineering Department is required before the release of any performance
securities can occur.
   C.   Stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural
vegetative cover has either been partially or wholly cleared or removed by
development activities shall be re-vegetated within ten days from the
substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following
criteria shall apply to re-vegetation efforts:
   1.   Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time when the cover crop is established
over ninety percent of the seeded area.
   2.   Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable
of controlling erosion.
   a.   Any area of re-vegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
seventy-five percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately
following re-vegetation. Re-vegetation must be repeated in successive years
until the minimum seventy-five percent survival for one year is achieved.
   b.   In addition to the above requirements, a plan must be submitted with
the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management
techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan must
explain how the site will be stabilized after construction, who will be
responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices
will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. This
plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by the soil
conservation district, and must be approved prior to receiving a permit.
(Ord. 08-29, 2008)
13.26.140 Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities.
   A.   Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a
stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site must execute or plat a maintenance easement
agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the
stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the
facility at all times for inspection by the engineering department or their
contractor or agent. The engineering department may also perform special
assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in
proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions
established by this chapter. The easement agreement shall be recorded as part
of the record plat in the land records.
   B.   Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management
facilities or structural BMP shall be ensured through the creation of a formal
maintenance covenant that is recorded into the land record prior to final plan
approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and
how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater
management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic
inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled
cleanouts.
   C.   Requirements for maintenance covenants. All stormwater management
facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document
maintenance and repair needs, and to ensure compliance with the requirements of
this chapter and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include;
removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a
timely manner, as determined by the Engineering Department, and the inspection
and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure
proper functioning of the stormwater management facility.
   D.   Inspection of stormwater facilities or structural BMP's. Inspection
programs by the BMP owners may be established on any reasonable basis. These
programs include but are not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher sources
of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants. They may also include
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher
discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are
more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal
water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit. The City
may also choose to perform joint spot inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are
not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control
facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and
other stormwater management practices.
   E.   Right-of-Entry for Inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City the right to enter
the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of
inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a
reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring or
has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or
correction of a violation of this chapter.
   F.   Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible
for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall
make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall
retain the records for at least ten years. These records shall be made
available to the engineering department during inspection of the facility and
shall be submitted annually to the engineering department.
   G.   Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses
to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the Engineering
Department, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the
facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater
management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the
City Engineer shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the
stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the
responsible person(s) shall have ten days to effect maintenance and repair of
the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the engineering
department may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work
and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or
prorated against the beneficial users of the property.
