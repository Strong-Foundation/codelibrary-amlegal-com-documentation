any provision below and apply to individuals who are exempted or excluded from
the application of this statute. For example, a unit may prohibit the
employment of a relative that is not otherwise prohibited by this statute.
      (2)   The annual report filed by a unit with SBOA under I.C. 5-11-13-

      (1)   Section 8 of HEA-1005 creates a new statute at I.C. 36-1-21 that
establishes minimum requirements regarding contracting with relatives of
elected officials of a unit. This new statute also requires that the
legislative body of a unit adopt an anti-nepotism policy and that the unit’s
executive file an annual certified statement with SBOA stating that the unit’s
legislative body adopted such a policy. Failure to implement a policy will
prevent the Department from approving the unit’s budget or additional
appropriations for the ensuing year.

terminates at the downstream end of the outside shut off valve to the water
service. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of
any meter or ahead of any backflow prevention assembly. Service connection
shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other
temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water
system.
   (C)   Water system requirements. The water system shall be considered as
made up of two parts: the utility system and the customer system.
      (1)   The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system; and shall include all air-gaps or approved backflow
prevention assemblies properly installed and components of the facilities
utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the
distribution system. The distribution system shall include the network of mains
used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
      (2)   The customer system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
   (D)   Compliance. No water service connection to any premises shall be
installed or maintained by the city unless the water supply is protected as
required by state rules and the regulations of this section. If service of
water to any premises by this section is not installed, tested and maintained,
or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed,
bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises, service
will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
   (E)   Inspection. The customer's system must be open for inspection at a
reasonable time to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether
there exist cross-connections, including violations of this section or
regulations which are adopted through this section.
   (F)   Discontinuance of service. When a volatile condition becomes known,
the Superintendent may deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises
by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the state statutes and city
ordinances relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted
pursuant thereto.
   (G)   Installation of back flow prevention assembly. An approved backflow
prevention assembly as defined by the IDEM Rule IAC 8-10, shall also be
installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the
property line or immediately inside the building being serviced; but, in all
cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is
not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the city, the public water system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of
hazard;
      (2)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow
prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality; and
      (3)   In the case of premises having (1) internal cross-connection that
cannot be permanently collected or controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises are not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible
to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line or lines where
potential hazards could exist.
   (H)   Pre-existing facilities. 
      (1)   Any backflow preventers or plumbing systems previously installed
and/or approved by the city prior to the existence of this section will not be
deemed compliant under the terms of this section simply due to their pre-
existence and prior approval. The city will review the current operations and
system hazards posed by any premises falling under this section to determine
the acceptability of said preventer. If the backflow preventer(s) is found
unacceptable, it shall be replaced in accordance with this section.
      (2)   Pre-existing facilities that have no backflow prevention device and
where there is a definite present hazard shall be required to install an
appropriate device, regardless of whether their plumbing system was previously
approved by the city.
   (I)   Type of protective assembly. The type of protective assembly required
shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
      (1)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply, the public water system shall be protected by an approved backflow
prevention assembly as defined by the IDEM Rule IAC 8-10;
      (2)   In the case of any premises where there is water or a substance
that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
double check valve assembly;
      (3)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous
to the health such as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public
water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include, but
are not limited to sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and planting plants;
      (4)   In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection;
      (5)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against back flow from the premises by either an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly on each service to the premises; and
      (6)   In case of any premises having a lawn irrigation system, the public
water system shall be protected by an approved pressure vacuum breaker backflow
prevention assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly.
   (J)   Approval of backflow prevention assembly. Any backflow prevention
assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the city. The
term APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY shall mean an assembly that has been
manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American
Water Works Association (AWWA) entitled "AWWA C506-84 Standards for Reduced
Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices." Said
assembly shall meet the laboratory and field performance specifications of the
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCC & HR) of
the University of Southern California established by [material missing].
   (K)   Adoption of standards by reference. The AWWA and FCCC & HR standards
and specifications specifically referenced in division (J) are hereby adopted
and incorporated by reference.
   (L)   Duty to test and repair. It shall be the duty of the customer-user at
any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have
certified inspections and operational tests made upon installations at least
once per year. In those instances where the city Water Superintendent deems the
hazard to be great enough, the Superintendent may require certified inspections
at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests will be at the expense
of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the
State of Indiana and the city. It shall be the duty of the city to see that
these tests are made in a timely manner. If a customer-user does not have its
backflow prevention assembly tested within 30 days of notification, the city
may discontinue water service to the premises to maintain the safety of the
public water system. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced
at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be
defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and made
available to the city. The city shall maintain record of all testing for each
required user.
   (M)   Exemptions. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
which do not meet the requirements of this section that were approved devices
for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have
been properly maintained, shall be excluded from the requirement of these rules
so long as the city is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the
utility system. However, whenever the existing device is moved from the present
location, fails testing or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the
city finds that the assembly or its maintenance constitutes a hazard to health,
the unit shall be replaced, at the consumer's expense, by an approved backflow
prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.
   (N)   Certification of testers. Certified testers shall be listed with the
city. In addition, certified testers will provide proof that test gauges used
in testing backflow prevention assemblies have been calibrated and certified
annually.
(Ord. 2-2016-1, passed 2-25-2016)
§ 52.06 RECONNECTION CHARGES AND SHUT-OFF VALVES.
   Whenever water service is disconnected to any premises at the customer’s
request for construction work, plumbing repairs/replacements, water leaks or
other similar circumstances, the reconnection fee of $50 as established in §
52.30 will be waived if the premises has an operable and functioning interior
water shut-off valve at the time of reconnection.
(Ord. 2021-1-2021-2, passed 2-23-2021)
WATER METERS
§ 52.15 INSTALLATION FOR NONUSERS OF CITY WATER OR RESIDENCES HAVING OWN WELL.
   (A)   For residences that have wells instead of city water, the sewage rate
is a flat rate and not based on water consumption. If a resident wishes to have
a meter installed from well point and house point, then his or her sewage rate
will be based upon his or her water consumption like other water customers in
the city. Furthermore, his or her sewer rate could fluctuate from month to
month, but no lower than the minimum rate.
   (B)   If a well user wishes to have a meter installed between well point and
house point, it is further agreed that:
      (1)   The homeowner must pay for this installation as well as the upkeep
of the meter, as determined by the Waterworks Superintendent;
      (2)   The homeowner shall also sign a liability release with the City
Water Department freeing the Department of damages and allowing it to come on
the homeowner’s property to install the meter and read the meter; and
      (3)   It is up to the well user to determine if he or she wishes to have
a meter installed and if so, he or she will accept the reading.

   (B)   Security deposits.
      (1)   Customers who open a new utility account with the city are required
to pay a security deposit of $100 at the time the new account is opened. A
customer must also show proof of identity, by way of a photo I.D., proof of
residence, and complete an application for service. Once all items are
submitted and the new account is approved, water service will begin within 24
hours.
      (2)   (a)   A customer who also is the owner of the property that is
connected to the utility may be entitled to receive a refund of his of her
deposit five years after the account was opened.
         (b)   In order to receive the refund, a property owner must show:
            1.   There have been no delinquent utility bills on the account for
the past two years; and
            2.   Documentation (such as property tax records or a deed)
demonstrating ownership of the property for at least the past five years.
      (3)   In the event that a customer has a delinquent utility bill, the
security deposit shall be applied toward the delinquency, first towards unpaid
water charges and second towards unpaid sewer charges. The customer will then
be required to replenish the security deposit to the original $100 amount of
the deposit. A customer who fails to replenish a security deposit will be
considered delinquent and may have his or her service terminated pursuant to
the city’s policies on delinquent accounts discussed herein.
      (4)   If a customer cancels or terminates utility service, the deposit
shall be applied to the customer’s final bill. Any balance remaining shall be
refunded to the customer if the customer provides a forwarding address. The
security deposit shall be forfeited if the customer has not provided a
forwarding address within one year of terminating service.
   (C)   Pool fill.
      (1)   Utility customers may fill a private pool using a city fire
hydrant. A flat fee of $76 ($51 to the Water Department for the water and $25
to the City Fire Department for hose rental) must be paid in advance for this
service. The pool fill must be supervised by employees of the Water or Fire
Departments and a one and one-half-inch hose from the Fire Department will be
used to fill the pool. Pool fills will only be performed during regular
business hours and regular duties of the Departments will take precedence over
pool fills.
      (2)   Pool meters are also available for use and may be picked up at the
water office at City Hall. There is a $25 charge, per four days, to rent a pool
meter. There is a $25 charge per day for each day the meter is not returned
after the initial four-day period. If a meter is damaged or lost, there is a
$135 charge. An adjustment will be made to a customer’s utility bill based upon
a reading of the pool meter once returned.
      (3)   Utility customers may choose to use their own hose and spigot to
fill a pool. However, no adjustments will be made to a customer’s utility bill
for the pool fill if they elect to use this method.
   (D)   Late payments and delinquent bills.
      (1)   Utility bills are due on the fifteenth day of each month. A late
fee is assessed to all bills not paid by the due date. The late payment charge
shall be 10% of the total bill before tax.
      (2)   If a bill is past due for over one month, the account is considered
delinquent and water service will be disconnected if the account is not brought
out of delinquency. Written notice will be provided to a customer before water
service is disconnected.
      (3)   Once service has been disconnected, it will not be reconnected
until the account has been paid in full and a reconnection fee, in the amount
of $50, has been paid. Service will be reconnected the following business day
after the account has been fully paid and the reconnection fee has been paid.
      (4)   If a customer has a delinquent bill, no new service will be
provided in the customer’s name (or in the name of another member of the
household) until the delinquent bill is paid in full.
      (5)   In addition, no new service will be provided in the name of a
different customer to an address with an outstanding delinquent bill. All
amounts owed must be paid before service to the address will be connected.
However, this policy shall not be applied if the ownership of the property has
changed since the delinquent bill was incurred.
   (E)   Sewer liens.
      (1)   Delinquent sewer bills may also result in a lien being placed
against the property to which service has been provided.
      (2)   If the property is occupied by someone other than the owner, the
city may only place a lien against the property if the city has notified the
owner of the delinquency within 20 days of the time the sewer bill became 60
days delinquent. However, the city is only required to provide notice to the
owner of the property if the owner has provided the Utility Office with written
notice of the address to which the notice is to be sent.
      (3)   Accordingly, all property owners who rent or lease their property
are encouraged to provide the Utility Office with the aforementioned written
notice in order to receive warning before a sewer lien is placed against the
property.
   (F)   Disturbing water meters. A city ordinance (2000-1201) prohibits anyone
except the Utilities Superintendent (or persons designated by the
Superintendent) from opening meter lids or otherwise disturbing, or adjusting a
water meter. This section further prohibits placing objects on meter lids or
otherwise obstructing Water Department personnel from reading water meters.
   (G)   Turning on or shutting off water service. Normally, a request to turn
on or shut off water service will be honored within 24 business hours of the
request being made to the Utility Office. Additional time may, however, be
required depending on the work schedules and responsibilities of utility
personnel.
   (H)   Bill adjustments and variances from Department policies.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Customers who believe that their bill is in error or should
otherwise be adjusted (i.e., leak adjustment) may request that the Board of
Public Works and Safety review their bill. Similarly, customers who wish to
request a variance from the Department’s rule and regulations must submit the
request to the Board. All adjustments and variances must be approved by the
Board of Public Works and Safety.
         (b)   If a customer believes that his or her bill is misstated, he or
she should first contact the Utility Office. The Utility Office will then
schedule to have the customer’s water meter reread to determine if an error has
been made in the reading of his or her meter. If the meter reading appears
correct, Water Department personnel may then conduct a leak check to attempt to
establish if there is a leak in the water line leading to the customer’s home/
business or within the water pipes or fixtures within his or her home/business.
Customers requesting leak checks will be charged $25, which fee is payable at
the time of the service. This fee does not apply if the customer has been
tagged by the Utility Office for a leak check.
      (2)   Leak adjustments.
         (a)   A customer may request an adjustment if they suffer a water
leak. Typically such an adjustment consists of a reduction in the customer’s
sewer bill by reducing the consumption from the actual meter reading to the
customer’s average of the prior six month period. A customer is limited to one
adjustment per one-month period.
         (b)   In limited circumstances, the Board may also consider making an
adjustment to a customer’s water bill. Pursuant to I.C. 8-1.5-3.5, the city may
make an adjustment to a sewer bill if the following criteria are satisfied:
            1.   The customer is a residential customer;
            2.   The customer has an UNUSUALLY LARGE BILL which is defined as a
bill that is at least two times the customer’s average monthly usage at the
premises;
            3.   The excessive use reflected in a monthly bill is the result of
damage to any facility or equipment supplying water to the customer’s premises;
            4.   The damage was not visible or detectable on the customer’s
premises except on excavation or some other disturbance of the property; and
            5.   The damage was not the result of the act of the customer (or
any agent or contractor hired by the customer).
         (c)   If a customer presents adequate evidence to the Board that the
above conditions are satisfied, the Board may consider adjusting the customer’s
water and sewer bills by reducing them to the average for the prior three-month
period.
      (3)   Procedure for requesting an adjustment or variance from Department
rules.
         (a)   All bill adjustments or variances from Utility Department rules
or regulations must be approved by the Board of Public Works. Customers who
wish to request an adjustment or variance from Department policies may submit
their request in writing to the Board of Public Works on the proper form which
is available at the Utility Office.
         (b)   The Board of Public Works usually meets every third Monday of
the month at 4:00 p.m. and will consider all requests for adjustments or
variances that have been submitted prior to the beginning of the Board’s
meeting. Customers requesting an adjustment or variance are not required to
attend the Board’s meeting.
      (4)   Emergency relief.
         (a)   The city recognizes that in some emergency circumstances
(meaning threatening or endangering life, health or property), a customer’s
request for a variance from Department policies must be acted upon before the
Board of Public Works next regularly scheduled meeting. Accordingly, the Office
Manager may conditionally grant a variance from Department rules, subject to
approval by the Board of Public Works at its next meeting.
         (b)   A customer requesting such emergency relief still must complete
the appropriate form requesting the variance in writing. The Office Manager may
then grant emergency relief by signing the form and indicating the relief
granted. At the next regular meeting of the Board of Public Works, the full
Board will then decide whether to affirm, rescind or modify the relief granted.
         (c)   If a customer’s request for emergency relief is denied by the
Office Manager the customer’s request will still be considered by the Board of
Public Works at its next meeting.

§ 52.32 SUMMER SPRINKLER ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   The intent of this section is to allow residential City Water
Department customers the opportunity to have sewage rate charges abated for
water usage that does not become sewage treatment water during peak use summer
months. The time frame for peak summer usage normally extends from late spring
to early fall. This section will define this period as June billing period
payable in July through August billing period payable September. This section
offers residential customers relief from sewage rate charges for the purpose of
pool filling, common outdoor cleaning, lawn and garden watering during the
period of time listed above.
   (B)   City Water Department residential customers wishing to take advantage
of the summer sprinkler rates will register with the City Water Department
office from April through May each year. The charge for this service is $20
annually. Customers signing up for this service after May 31 will be charged
$40.
   (C)   The City Water Department is responsible for due notification to the
public each year prior to the sign up period. For the purpose of this section,
minimum due notification will be considered an advertisement of the sign-up
period one day a week, every other week April through May each year, “4
individual notifications.” This advertisement will be made using the most
common form of public media.
   (D)   The sewer rate adjustment will be based on an average of three
individual months total volume usage during full time occupancy. This normal
usage average will be used as a baseline for the summer sprinkler rate.
      (1)   The months used to define the average will not include the summer
usage period, but will include three months during normal full-time occupancy
October through April.
      (2)   Months with leak adjustments will not be averaged.
      (3)   Months with no occupancy or minimal usage bills will not be used
for averages.
      (4)   No customer with late or in arrears payments owed to the Water
Department will be eligible.
   (E)   Once the summer rate is defined and the annual service charge paid,
City Water Department residential customers will not be charged sewer rates for
monthly total usage volumes that exceed 1,000 gallons over their respective
normal usage average during the period described as May through September.
   (F)   Example, if a residential customer has an approved normal usage
average of 10,000 gallons, that customer would not pay sewage rates for amounts
exceeding 11,000 gallons during the billing periods June payable in July
through August payable in September.
   (G)   All other water/sewer rate adjustments that fall outside the scope of
this section will continue to be handled by the City Water Department, the City
Board of Public Works and Safety or the Mayor’s office.
(Ord. 4-2013-1, passed 4-9-2013)
§ 52.33 CROWN HILL REGIONAL SEWER DISTRICT.
   (A)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based upon the quantity of water
used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges, as
the same may be measured by the water meter there in use, except as otherwise
provided in this section.
   (B)   The water usage schedule upon which the amount of such rates and
charges shall be determined shall be based upon consumption by the month with
charges for sewage to be as follows: $22.12 per 1,000 gallons.
   (C)   Each user shall in addition to the above rates pay a fee of $5,000 for
each tap on. Each user shall be given credit toward taps for the amount that
user has paid to the district for assessments or contributions.
   (D)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the sewer district shall have the right to
base its charges not only on volume but also on the strength and character of
the sewage and waste which is discharged into the system. The sewage district
shall have the right to measure and determine the strength and content of all
sewage and waste discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the district’s
sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as it may deem
practicable in the light of conditions and attending circumstances of the case,
in order to determine the proper charge.
   (E)   Charges shall be based on the strength of the sewage and liquid waste
as determined by analysis of samples taken from time to time by the district.
The strength and character of the sewage and waste shall be based on the
quantity of suspended solids and five day biochemical oxygen demand, determined
on samples of the sewage and wastes sampled and determined in accordance with
the latest copy of Standard Methods of Analysis for Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes, as published by the American Public Health Association or it
successor.
   (F)   A schedule of rates and charges shall be prepared and billed by the
district and shall be collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (G)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the property served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but
such billings shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of property served, which
are occupied by tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records
of the district for the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges
have been paid by such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at
the office at which such records are kept and during the hours at which such
office is open for business.
   (H)   The rates established by this section shall become effective upon
sewage service being furnished to a user.

§ 52.34 DISCONNECTION OF WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   Any customer who is delinquent on their combined water/sewer bill and
is subject to disconnection for nonpayment thereof must be notified of the
impending disconnection and the customer’s right to a hearing to determine the
appropriateness of the disconnection.
   (B)   If a customer desires to request a hearing to contest disconnection,
the customer must request such hearing within seven days after the date of the
mailing of a disconnection notice.
   (C)   The hearing shall be held before the Clerk-Treasurer (or his or her
designee) and the customer shall be notified of the hearing date and time. The
Clerk-Treasurer (or his or her designee) shall render a decision on the appeal
(modify, uphold or reverse the shut-off order) within one business day of the
hearing.
   (D)   The form attached to Resolution 2014-6, passed 10-21-2014, shall be
used to notify customers of an impending disconnection and the customer’s right
to request a hearing.

new developments to assume that all such proposals are consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage; all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage; and adequate drainage is provided so as to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (C)   The Building Commissioner shall require new or replacement water
supply systems or sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Clinton, Indiana does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM, The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30.)
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
the Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance all
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source (see FLOOD).
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA (see FREEBOARD).
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community, The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless;
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls.
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and,
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle."
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is two fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929 is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993 is a

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION'(PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.07 of this chapter. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE
FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city are
generally identified as such on the Vermillion County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated February 5, 2014 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

§ 151.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.47 of this chapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined, as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR §
65.12.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 155.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.47 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 155.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOOD WAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway permit (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.40 through
151.47 of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.40 through
151.47 of this chapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
151.40 through
151.47.
(Ord. 1-2014-1, passed 1-30-2014)
