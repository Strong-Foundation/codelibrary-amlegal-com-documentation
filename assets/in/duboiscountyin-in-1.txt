   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known, and designated, as the “Dubois
County Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously-existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this, or any subsequent, codification in any official
publication to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended, or
its application to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the invalidity
does not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid
section or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
non-severability provision, each division, or part, of every section is
severable. If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with, and
so dependent upon, the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before, or after, the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

above, does not affect the operation of division (B) above with respect to that
chapter, subchapter, or section.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section a reference is made to another section hereof, the

changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.

   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this county exercising
the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of
any transfer of functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the County
Council or Board of Commissioners refers to any board, bureau, commission,
division, department, officer, agency, authority, or instrumentality of any
government, and that name designation is incorrectly stated; on the effective
date of that ordinance or following the effective date, the rights, powers,
duties, or liabilities placed with that entity are, or were, transferred to a
different entity; then the named board, bureau, commission, department,
division, officer, agency, authority, or instrumentality, whether correctly
named in the ordinance at its effective date or not, means that the correctly
named entity, or the entity to which the duties, liabilities, powers, and
rights were transferred.

   (A)   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of

words, was clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be

conform with the manifest intention, and the provisions shall have the same
effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as originally
published.

regarding the nature or extent of the error.

NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act, or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.

or law is not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any
section shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability
incurred under the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides.
   (B)   The section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the
purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of
the penalty, forfeiture, or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations, or any requirement of notice,

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof, as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or
title shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

emergency (or for a lesser period as they determine), any provisions of, or
procedures prescribed by, ordinances of the county if they would be impractical

division (B)(1)(j) below, the Board may not suspend any provisions of
ordinances or procedures which are mandated by statute;
         (j)   When the state of emergency has been proclaimed by the Governor,

         (m)   The Board may request the state or the United States, or their
agencies and political subdivisions, to send aid (including financial
assistance).
      (2)   All actions and regulations under this section may be made by

but shall be consistent with, and subordinate to, any actions, orders, or
regulations made by the Governor, or a state agency implementing the State
Department of Homeland Security Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.
   (C)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Director to make recommendations and
advise the Board of Commissioners, or the principle executive officer, on any
actions which it would be necessary or desirable to take under division (B)
above in the event of an emergency.

the county, and a state of emergency has not been declared by the Governor, nor
is any person having the powers of the principle executive officer present to
declare such an emergency pursuant to §
33.16, the Director may temporarily presume the existence of a state of
emergency even though not officially declared and may, as his or her own
judgment dictates, invoke, implement, and carry out such provisions of the
county’s adopted Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan as are necessary to
cope with the emergency and protect the public safety and welfare, and shall be
construed to have all powers necessary and dispensable to doing so, to the
extent not specifically limited by statute or specifically limited herein,

to the State Board of Accounts all erroneous or irregular material losses,

from any District fund is an amount over $500; and
      (2)   Other assets loss, shortage, or theft. A loss, shortage, or theft

or assets. The investigation and the resolution of the investigation must be
documented by the District Board, or its designee who conducts the
investigation. Such documentation should be maintained in the office of the
District. State law requires public employees who have actual knowledge of, or
reasonable cause to believe, a misappropriation of funds, or other assets, has
occurred to report such misappropriation to the State Board of Accounts and the
County Prosecuting Attorney.

   (F)   As required by I.C. 34-28-5-1, an infraction may not be deferred to an
offense or violation under I.C. 9-24-6 involving the operation of a commercial
motor vehicle.
   (G)   A prosecutor shall not negotiate a diversion agreement with an
unrepresented defendant prior to a waiver of the right to counsel at an initial
hearing before a judicial officer.
   (H)   Diversion and deferral agreements shall be in writing, executed by the
parties, and filed with the court as a public document.
   (I)   The elected prosecuting attorney shall not receive any salary
appropriation from diversion or deferral funds.
   (J)   Prosecutors’ offices which receive diversion or deferral funds should

§ 34.47 FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY.
   (A)   Definitions and provisions. For the purpose of this section, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
      CAPITAL ASSET. An asset having a useful life of more than one year and an
actual or historical cost of $5,000 or more. CAPITAL ASSETS include: land,
easements, right-of-ways, land improvements, building, building improvements,
construction in progress, machinery and equipment, vehicles, infrastructure,
works of art and monuments, and all other tangible assets used in operations
with useful lives extending beyond one year.
      CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures that benefit both current and future fiscal
periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures, construction or
improvement of buildings, structures, or other fixed assets, and equipment
purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness. These are
expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the government's
general fixed assets.
      FIXED ASSET. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating activities of the unit and that are relatively permanent and are
needed for the production or sale of goods or services that are termed
property, plant and equipment, or fixed assets. These assets are not held for
sale in the ordinary course of business. This broad group is usually separated
into classes according to the physical characteristics of the items (such as
land, buildings, improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment).
      VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS. Capital assets should be recorded at actual
cost. Normally, the cost recorded is the purchase price or construction costs
of the asset, but also included are any reasonable and necessary costs incurred
to place the asset in its intended location and intended use that can be
directly related to the asset. Such costs could include the following: legal
and title fees; appraisal and negotiation fees; surveying fees; damage
payments; land preparation costs; demolition costs; architect and accounting
fees; insurance premiums during construction; transportation charges; and
interest costs during construction. Donated or contributed assets should be
recorded at their fair market value on the date donated or acquired.
   (B)   Asset definitions by major category. It is important to the
maintenance of accurate records that each asset category be precisely defined
and that all persons responsible for records maintenance be fully aware of the
categorization system. This division further clarifies the asset definition by
major category.
      (1)   Land.
         (a)   The county will capitalize all land purchases or land donations.
All land purchases shall be capitalized with the actual cost of purchase or if
unavailable, the estimated historical cost. This includes all specified land,
easements, right-of-ways, lots, and parcels owned by the governmental unit or
its various departments, boards or authorities, regardless of the method of
acquisition. This includes land purchased outright as an easement or right-of-
way to infrastructures. All costs of legal services incidental to the
acquisition of land, costs relating to the razing for the structure, and other
charges incurred in preparing the land for use are capitalized and carried in
the land account. Donated land will be capitalized at the fair market value at
the time of the donation.
         (b)   All properties obtained through tax sale including but not
limited to land, buildings, land improvements, and building improvements shall
be considered to have no dollar value and will be excluded from reporting as
they are considered property that is being held for resale.
      (2)   Buildings.
         (a)   The county will capitalize all buildings at the purchase price
or construction cost. Buildings are all structures designed and erected to
house equipment, services or functions. This includes systems, services, and
fixtures within the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire
escapes, canopies, areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all such units
that serve the building. Plumbing systems; lighting systems; heating, cooling,
ventilating and air handling systems; alarm systems; sound systems;
surveillance systems; passenger and freight elevators; escalators; built-in
casework; walk-in coolers and freezers; fixed shelving; and other fixed
equipment are included with the building. Communication antennas and/or towers
are not included as buildings. These are parts of the equipment units they
serve.
         (b)   Additions, improvements, and leasehold improvements to the
building as well as the cost of the heating and ventilating system or other
permanently attached fixtures should be capitalized when these costs are
considered betterments. These improvements or renovations to the buildings will
be capitalized in the county if the total cost is $5,000 or greater.
Replacement of a building roof or heating and cooling system will be
capitalized when the cost of the item is $5,000 or greater.
         (c)   Donated buildings will be capitalized using the market value of
the building at the time of the donation. Building purchases made using the
federal or state funding shall follow the appropriate funding source guidelines
and the county capital asset policy.
      (3)   Improvements other than buildings. The county will capitalize
improvements other than buildings in the following manner:
         (a)   Improvements such as excavation, non-infrastructure utility
installation, driveways, parking lots, flagpoles, sidewalks, retaining walls,
and fencing shall be capitalized when the cost of the item is $5,000 or
greater.
         (b)   Milling and paving of an existing parking lot shall be
considered maintenance rather than a capital asset.
         (c)   Improvements other than buildings will be capitalized at the
actual cost of the improvement. If the actual cost is unavailable, the
improvement will be capitalized using its current replacement cost, estimated
date of purchase, and the Indiana Board of Accounts factoring table to
determine the estimated historical cost.
         (d)   The county department heads shall report to the County Auditor
any improvements other than buildings which their respective departments
authorized that cost $5,000 or greater.
         (e)   Donated improvements other than buildings will be capitalized at
the fair market value at the time of the donation.
      (4)   Construction work in progress. The county will capitalize actual
amounts expended on an uncompleted building or other capital construction
project. Once the project is completed, the cumulative costs are transferred to
the appropriate permanent fixed asset account.
      (5)   Machinery and equipment.
         (a)   The county will capitalize all machinery and equipment at the
purchase price or actual cost. The cost of the asset acquired when payment
includes both cash and a trade-in is the sum of the cash paid plus the fair
market value of the asset traded in. If the fair market value of the asset
being traded in is not readily determinable, cost may be recorded as the cash
paid plus the book value (asset cost minus accumulated depreciation) of the
asset traded in.
         (b)   Equipment includes all types of physical property within the
scope of the capital asset policy for the county not previously classified.
Included in this category are office mechanical equipment, office furniture,
appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication
equipment, police, fire, sanitation, Park Department equipment, laboratory
equipment, vehicles, road and highway equipment, aircraft, EMS and emergency
equipment, earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense and emergency
equipment, and data processing equipment. All supplies are excluded.
         (c)   The county shall capitalize all machinery and equipment items
with an actual cost or estimated cost of $5,000 or greater. Attachments to
machinery and equipment will be capitalized if purchased at the same time as
the equipment item. Attachments that are purchased separately from a given
equipment item will be capitalized separately from the item if they are
purchased at a time other than when the original item was purchased and have a
cost of $5,000 or greater.
         (d)   Items which extend the useful life of the equipment shall be
capitalized. Department heads should report to the County Auditor the
description, year completed, funding source and dollar amount. An example would
be the purchase of a motor for a vehicle. This does not include the normal
maintenance costs or supplies.
         (e)   Donated machinery and equipment will be capitalized at the fair
market value at the time of donation.
      (6)   Infrastructure.
         (a)   The county will capitalize all county-owned roads and bridges.
All county roads and bridges will be capitalized at original cost or historical
estimated cost. Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that
normally can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most
capital assets and that are normally stationary in nature. Infrastructure
assets include roads, bridges, streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems
and water systems. Maintenance and repairs will be considered as necessary to
maintain the existing asset and therefore are not capitalized. Examples such as
patching, resurfacing, milling, chip sealing, and snow removal shall be
considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Additionally, normal
department operating activities, such as feasibility studies, and primary
engineering and design will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of
the infrastructure asset.
         (b)   Gravel roads that are paved shall be considered a capital asset.
County roads that are redesigned or re-engineered beyond maintenance activities
such as paving, milling, or chip sealing shall be considered a capital asset.
Roads that are accepted by the Board of Commissioners and the Highway
Department from developers or owners shall be capitalized at the market value
at the time of the donation.
   (C)   Recording and accounting.
      (1)   The County Auditor shall ensure that accounting for capital assets
is being exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially
and periodically in subsequent years. The County Auditor will further ensure
that the capital asset report shall be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation
calculation. The County Auditor shall be responsible for maintaining the
records and accounts of all capital assets that have an actual cost or
estimated historical costs of $5,000 or greater.
      (2)   The County Auditor will depreciate the capital assets of the county
by using the straight-line method or the composite/group method of
depreciation. Land is not depreciated according to general accepted accounting
principles. Depreciable property must meet the following qualifications: the
asset must have a useful life of more than one year and the asset must wear out
or lose value over time.
      (3)   Useful life is defined for each asset class as follows:
         (a)   Land: not depreciated.
         (b)   Buildings: 50 years.
         (c)   Improvements other than buildings: 15 years.
         (d)   Construction work in progress: not depreciated.
         (e)   Machinery and equipment: ten years, unless otherwise specified
below.
            1.   Distributer trucks and motor graders: 25 years.
            2.   Wheel loaders, dirt loaders, asphalt compactor rollers,
snowplows, sanders, and chain saws: 20 years.
            3.   Sanitation trucks: 15 years.
            4.   Dump trucks, pickups, and excavators: ten years.
            5.   Boom mower and tractors: eight years.
            6.   Patrol cars: five years.
         (f)   Infrastructure assets.
            1.   Roads: 50 years.
            2.   Bridges: 75 years.
      (4)   Infrastructure record keeping and reconciliation.
         (a)   The County Highway Engineer shall be responsible for maintaining
accurate records regarding all county infrastructure. If roads or bridges are
permanently closed, or new roads are accepted into the county road system by
the County Board of Commissioners, such changes shall be recorded by the County
Auditor in the year that such changes occur. If a gravel road is paved, or if a
road is totally redone beyond milling and paving, or chip sealing, such
improvement shall be considered a capital asset if the cost is $5,000 or
greater.
         (b)   Normal department operating activities regarding infrastructure,
such as feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, and design, will be
expensed rather than capitalized greater.
   (D)   Maintenance of assets. For the maintenance of the capital asset
accounting report, the department heads have the responsibility to report
additions, retirements, and transfers in detail to the County Auditor. Detail
includes such data elements as asset description, location, make, model, serial
number, date of acquisition, cost, life and other information deemed relevant.
Reports shall be made in a timely manner, as the capital asset record must be
updated annually. Property should not be transferred, turned in for auction or
disposed of without the approval of the Board of Commissioners. Department
heads shall report all disposed items to the County Auditor, who shall remove
the item from the county capital asset inventory. All lost or stolen items
shall be reported to the County Auditor by the department heads.
   (E)   Periodic inventories. A physical inventory of capital assets will be
conducted by each department as near as practical to year-end. The County
Auditor will provide a list of the inventory on file which will be sent to each
department head before each year-end. The department heads will then compare
physical observations of assets to the listing noting whether the assets exist,
the location if not apparent otherwise, and relevant factors. If the condition
of an asset has deteriorated to the point its useful life has been impaired,
the fact should be noted, and the reasons for such omissions should be
documented to the extent possible. Department heads shall be accountable for
the capital asset inventory charged to their department. The physical capital
asset inventory sheet and related documentation shall be forwarded to both the
County Auditor and the Board of Commissioners. The County Auditor will compare
the results of the physical inventory to the capital asset records and make
necessary adjustments to the capital assets.

TAX ABATEMENT PROCEDURE
§ 35.20 PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AVAILABLE.
   (A)   There shall be available, within the jurisdictional limits of the
county, a program of property tax abatements in accordance with I.C. 6-1.1-
12.1, as amended from time to time, for the redevelopment and/or rehabilitation
of commercial and industrial property, and for the acquisition and installation
of new manufacturing equipment in areas within the jurisdiction of the county
authority, which is hereafter designated by the County Council as “Economic
Revitalization Areas”.
   (B)   The terms “Economic Revitalization Areas”, “new manufacturing
equipment”, “property”, “redevelopment”, and “rehabilitation”, as used in §§
35.20 through
35.26, shall have the same meaning as said terms are defined by I.C. 6-1.1-
12.1-1, and as provided for in I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-2. The term “new” manufacturing
equipment, in some cases, may include certain used equipment.
(Council Ord. 2017-02, passed 10-22-2018)
§ 35.21 APPLICATION; PROCEDURE; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The county shall prepare printed forms, and require all applicants
applying for designation/abatement to complete and submit such forms.
Applicants shall submit separate forms for real property abatement and personal
property abatement.
   (B)   The applications shall include, but not be limited to, the following
information: description of the real estate; proposed use of the real estate;
proposed type and costs of redevelopment, rehabilitation, and/or new
manufacturing equipment, and/or research and development equipment; and
description of the proposed operation and number of jobs to be created, wages
for jobs to be created, and the projected date of completion for the proposed
improvements.
   (C)   The original completed application, fee, and other forms required by
the county, shall be submitted to the County Auditor. Said information shall be
forwarded to a committee composed of the County Auditor, or a representative,
two representatives of the County Council, and a representative of the County
Board of Commissioners, and the County Assessor, or a representative, for
review and to make written recommendations to the County Council regarding the
desirability of designating the area described in the application as an
Economic Revitalization Area, and may recommend the period of time during which
the area shall be so designated and the type of abatement/incentives that
should be allowed, in accordance with I.C. 6-1.1-12.1 and any other state law,
and after following the procedures set forth in divisions (E) and (F) below.
The committee designated above may consult with such other individuals or
entities as members of the committee determine advisable in review of the
application to provide information necessary, in the sole opinion of the
committee, to form a recommendation regarding the effect of granting the
application. The County Council shall consider the application and
recommendation, and make the determination as to whether or not to grant the
Economic Revitalization Area status in accordance with I.C. 6-1.1-12.1 and
amounts of tax abatement in accordance with §
35.23(C).
   (D)   Pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-17, the County Council hereby adopts, as a
guideline, the alternative abatement schedule set forth in §
35.23(G) and (H), which considers the total amount of the applicant’s
investment in real and personal property, the number of new full-time
equivalent jobs created, the average wage of the new employees compared to the
state minimum wage, and the infrastructure requirements for the applicant’s
investment.
   (E)   The applicant must provide reasons why the project site qualifies as
an Economic Revitalization Area as defined under state law; for example, lack
of development, cessation of growth, deterioration of improvements or character
of occupancy, age, obsolescence, substandard buildings, or other factors that
have impaired values or prevent a normal development of property or use of
property.
   (F)   The application shall include information as to the total amount of
investment to be made in real and personal property, the number of new full-
time equivalent jobs being created, the average wage of the new employees
compared to the state minimum wage, and the infrastructure requirements for the
taxpayer’s investment.
(Council Ord. 2017-02, passed 10-22-2018)
§ 35.22 FILING FEE.
   Upon filing his or her application and any other forms required by the
county for real property tax abatement, the applicant shall pay a non-
refundable filing fee in the sum of $250, made payable to the county. Upon
filing his or her application, and any other forms required by the county for
personal property tax abatement, the applicant shall pay a non-refundable
filing fee in the sum of $250, made payable to the county. If the applicant
files for both real property and personal property abatement, the applicant
shall pay a total non-refundable fee of $500.
(Council Ord. 2017-02, passed 10-22-2018)
§ 35.23 INELIGIBLE PROJECTS; SCORING SYSTEM; OTHER REQUIREMENTS; SCHEDULES.
   (A)   Ineligible projects. 
      (1)   Any applicant who completes an assessor assessment registration or
building permit if within an incorporated area’s jurisdiction for a proposed
project or acquires new manufacturing equipment prior to filing the appropriate
tax phase-in (abatement) applications may not be eligible for tax phase-in
(abatement). This is because the decision of the Council to designate the
Economic Revitalization Area must be passed on the finding that the area is
undesirable for normal development.
      (2)   Pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-3(e), tax abatement for the
redevelopment or rehabilitation of real property may not be approved for the
following facilities:
         (a)   Private or commercial golf course;
         (b)   Country club;
         (c)   Massage parlor;
         (d)   Tennis club;
         (e)   Skating facility (including roller skating, skateboarding, or
ice skating);
         (f)   Racquet sport facility (including any handball or racquetball
court);
         (g)   Hot tub facility;
         (h)   Suntan facility;
         (i)   Racetrack;
         (j)   Any facility the primary purpose of which is (unless the
facility is located in an economic development target area established under
state law):
            1.   Retail food and beverage service;
            2.   Automobile sales or service; or
            3.   Other retail.
         (k)   Residential, unless:
            1.   Multifamily facility with no less than 20% of units available
for low and moderate income individuals;
            2.   Located in an economic development target area; or
            3.   Located in an area designated as a residential distressed
area.
         (l)   A package liquor store that holds a liquor dealer’s permit under
I.C. 7.1-3-10, or any other entity that is required to operate under a license
issued under I.C. 7.1. This division (A)(2)(l) does not apply to an applicant
that:
            1.   Was eligible for tax abatement before July 1, 1995;
            2.   Is described in I.C. 7.1-5-7-11; or
            3.   Operates a facility under:
               a.   A beer wholesaler’s permit under I.C. 7.1-3-3;
               b.   A liquor wholesaler’s permit under I.C. 7.1-3-8; or
               c.   A wine wholesaler’s permit under I.C. 7.1-3-13 for which
the applicant claims a deduction under this chapter.
      (3)   The County Council will not generally consider granting Economic
Revitalization Area designation for “speculative developments” for which no
major tenant has been identified. The County Council may consider granting an
ERA designation if exceptional circumstances, in the discretion of the County
Council, exist.
   (B)   Applications.
      (1)   The applicant must provide reasons why the project site qualifies
as an Economic Revitalization Area as defined under state law, i.e., lack of
development, cessation of growth, deterioration of improvements, or character
of occupancy, age, obsolescence, substandard buildings, or other factors that
have impaired values or prevent a normal development of property or use of
property.
      (2)   The application shall include information as to the total amount of
investment to be made in real and personal property, the number of new full-
time equivalent jobs being created, the average wage of the new employees
compared to the state minimum wage and the infrastructure requirements for the
taxpayer’s investment.
   (C)   Scoring system. The County Council utilizes a scoring system as a
guide for determining the appropriate length of time (one of ten time periods
for real estate and one of five time periods for personal property are set
forth in the guidelines) of the property tax abatement(s) being sought for a
proposed project. The County Council may deviate from these guidelines and
grant more or less tax abatement for longer or shorter periods of time (but not
to exceed ten years) on a case-by-case basis as long as all requirements of
Indiana law are met. The County Council may, in its sole discretion, determine
that certain projects should not receive any tax abatement, no matter what the
outcome using the schedules divisions (G) and (H) below.
   (D)   Real property.
      (1)   A property’s assessed value is the basis for property taxes.
Annually, local assessing officials assess the value of real property on
January 1 based on market value. Property owners can estimate the property
taxes for new construction by adding the cost of the land and improvements
together and multiplying by the tax rate. For real property tax abatement
calculation purposes, the cost of the improvements (the land itself cannot be
abated) would be utilized as the real property assessed value.
      (2)   This real property assessment value could then be phased-in.
   (E)   Personal property.
      (1)   Personal property values are assessed January 1 of every year and
are self-reported by property owners to the assessor using prescribed state
forms. Generally speaking, personal property taxes are levied against all
tangible property other than real property. Numerous deductions can be applied
to personal property. Of course, the value of personal property over time will
be subject to depreciation, therefore, applicants are advised to seek the
counsel of a financial advisor.
      (2)   To determine the eligibility of your specific type of personal
property and for additional information on the state’s property tax assessment
system, check the State Department of Local Government Finance website at
www.in.gov/dlgf.
   (F)   Other requirements.
      (1)   The applicant for tax abatement, or an authorized representative,
must attend all meetings of the County Council that deal with the application
for tax abatement.
      (2)   (a)   Property owners receiving tax abatement are required to file
forms pursuant to state law on an annual basis by the dates required by state
law with the County Auditor and/or County Assessor for each year during which
tax abatement is received.
         (b)   The County Committee, as established in §
35.21(C), will verify the information prior to presenting the annual report to
the County Council.
   (G)   Real and personal property tax abatement guideline scoring criteria;
project evaluation criteria for new and existing businesses in the county.

   (A)   All persons, companies, corporations, partnerships, and other legal
entities shall be required to obtain a truck hauling permit prior to operating
any motor vehicle upon any road within the jurisdiction of the county highway
system if the total gross vehicle weight is in excess of the posted weight
limit for said road, as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   This section shall apply to all highways in the county highway system
under the jurisdiction of the Board of Commissioners, except highways in the
state highway system, and the state maintained routes thereof, through cities
and towns.
   (C)   The exemptions set forth in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) below, as
contained in I.C. 9-19-1-2 and 9-19-1-3, shall apply to this section.
      (1)   The provisions of this division (C) shall not apply to vehicles
while engaged in the construction of public highways when the movement of such
vehicles is confined wholly to such highway or roads, or sections thereof,
actually under construction and not yet open to unlimited public use, provided
that the owner, or operator, of such vehicle first obtains, from the proper
authority having jurisdiction, a permit, in writing, allowing such operation.
      (2)   The provisions of this division (C) shall not apply to machinery or
equipment used in highway construction or maintenance by the State Highway
Commission, counties, or municipalities; nor to farm-drainage machinery; nor to
implements of husbandry, when so constructed that they can be moved without
material damage to the highways; nor as limiting the width or height of farm
vehicles when loaded with farm products; and the vehicles enumerated in this
section may be moved, or operated, as to avoid any material damage to the
highway, or unreasonable interference with other highway traffic. For the
purpose of this section, any truck hauling unprocessed leaf tobacco is a farm
vehicle loaded with a farm product.
   (D)   The Board of Commissioners shall determine, in its sole discretion,
the county highways and roads, and portions thereof, which shall be closed or
which shall be limited to vehicles not exceeding a total gross vehicle weight
as determined by the Board of Commissioners for each of said county highways
and roads, and as designated by the posting of appropriate signs as hereinafter
provided in division (F) below.
   (E)   The determination of road closings and limitations may be altered, or
amended from time to time, by the addition or deletion of roads, or portions
thereof, or by the increase or decrease of weight limits for any of said roads,
as shall be determined to be necessary in the sole discretion of the Board of
Commissioners.
   (F)   The County Highway Department is now authorized, and directed, to
erect and maintain signs designating the provisions of this section at each end
of the portion of any county highway or road affected thereby, and at
intersecting highways or roads.
   (G)   The provisions of divisions (D) and (E) above shall not be effective
until signs designating the closing, or weight limits, are erected and
maintained at each end of the portion of county highway or road affected
thereby, and at all intersecting county highways or roads.
   (H)   Truck hauling permits shall be issued by the Auditor’s office, county
courthouse, in Jasper, Indiana. Prior to issuing any truck hauling permit for
any vehicle which shall be using a specific county highway or road for a
continuous, or extended, period of time, as determined by the Board of
Commissioners in its sole discretion, the County Auditor shall follow the
procedures adopted thereto by the Board of Commissioners, including the
requirement that the owner of said vehicle shall post with the County Auditor a
cash and surety bond, at least 20% of which shall be a cash bond in a form
approved by the Board of Commissioners, said bond equaling not more than
$60,000 per mile for each mile of surfaced blacktop road to be used, not more
than $40,000 per mile for each mile of chip and seal road to be used, and not
more than $20,000 per mile for each mile of gravel road to be used by said
owner. Said cash and surety bond shall ensure, and save harmless, the county
from maintenance of damage to, and repairs to, said road while said bond is in
effect.
      (1)   The cash portion of the bond shall be invested by the county in a
savings account in a local depository of the public funds in the name of the
county, with interest earned thereon to be credited of the individual,
partnership, or company filing the bond. The county shall withdraw from each
cash bond for the purpose of maintaining and repairing roads for which the bond
was filed under the following procedure in division (H)(2) below.
      (2)   When the County Highway Supervisor finds that a bonded county
highway is in need of repair or maintenance, he or she shall give three days
notice by receipted mail, return receipt requested, or delivered in person to
the users of said highway to repair or maintain the same to his or her
satisfaction. If the needed maintenance or repair is not done within three days
of delivery of the notice, the County Highway Supervisor will make the
necessary repairs, or provide the needed maintenance. After the maintenance or
repair work is done, those persons, partnership, or companies bonded to keep
the road maintained and in repair are to be notified of the amount expended for
such maintenance and repair, and their proportionate part of such cost, which
shall be paid to the County Auditor within seven days. If said sums are not
paid, the county shall withdraw the sum required from the cash bond to pay for
the repair and maintenance, and notify the person, partnership, or company of
the withdrawal. Within ten days thereafter, cash equal to the amount of the
expenditure must be deposited by the holders of the permits with the County
Auditor to maintain the 20% cash bond. If said bond is not maintained at 20%,
the County Board of Commissioners may order that the permit be revoked until
such time as the proper bond is filed.
      (3)   The owners of vehicles having surety bonds with the county in
existence as of the effective date of this section, which allow for use of
specific county highways and roads having weight limits thereon, shall not be
required to place additional bonds on said specific county highways and roads.
The owners of vehicles who have continuously, under the duly issued permits,
used, operated over, and satisfactorily maintained, in the sole discretion of
the Board of Commissioners, the designated county highways and roads for five
immediately preceding years, and who have not been in default on, sued upon, or
forfeited bonds on said highways and roads, may provide bond of an approved
surety in the amounts provided in division (H) above in lieu of a cash bond.
      (4)   In the event that a truck hauling permit requiring the posting of a
bond is requested for a county highway or road, or portion thereof, for which
such a truck hauling permit already exists, the County Auditor shall
immediately notify the holder of such existing permit, and his or her surety of
the request. Each permittee shall be held jointly, and severally, liable for
damage to any county highway or road, or portion thereof, which may be used by
more than one permittee.
   (I)   (1)   To prevent damage caused by excess weight on county roads during
periods of freeze and thaw, the Commissioners hereby establish a ten ton gross
load (weight) limit on all motor vehicles operated on county roads within
Dubois County, Indiana during the period from January 15, 2022 through April
15, 2022. Jasper 3rd Avenue from Jasper city limits south to S.R. 162 is exempt
from this division.
      (2)   Operation of a motor vehicle on any county road in violation of
this division shall be a Class C infraction, as defined by I.C. 34-6-2-85 and
I.C. 34-28-5-4.

travel routes.
   (C)   Permits are automatically invalidated by the violation of any of the
conditions specified by the terms of the permit or by false information given
on the application. Failure to comply with the conditions of this permit shall
be just cause for the immediate suspension or revocation of any or all permits
and the operator and/or owner of the vehicle shall be subject to appropriate
legal action.
   (D)   Oversized/overweight moving permits are issued for daylight hours
only, Monday through Friday. Permits are not valid from 1:00 p.m. on the day

public safety and welfare. Permits are only valid if favorable driving and
traffic conditions exist.
   (E)   The movement shall not impede other traffic in an unreasonable manner
and at no time shall traffic be blocked from use of the highway. Vehicles and
loads shall not be parked on the highway at any time.
   (F)   Vehicles shall be registered as required by the Indiana vehicle code

claim arising out of or related to the moving of said vehicle, load, or its
presence on or use of the highway by said vehicle and load.
   (I)   Permits are not valid if insurance expires or has expired. Each
applicant shall present evidence that at least the following insurance coverage
is in full force and effect on each vehicle while operating on the public

Department, and their officers, agents, and employees, are named as additional
insured parties."
   (K)   Permits will be issued only for vehicles owned by the applicant or
operated under a lease or rental agreement. The applicant may be required to
deposit a reasonable inspection fee and to furnish a cash bond to cover any
damage that might occur to roads, bridges, or highway structures by the
movement of vehicles and objects under the proposed permit.
   (L)   Permits will be issued for oversize or overweight vehicles or loads
which can be readily dismantled, reduced, or otherwise rearranged to come
within the legal limits. Permits will in no way supersede posted axle loading
limits on any bridge or highway. The applicant agrees to reimburse the Dubois
County Highway Department for any damage resulting from applicant's disregard
of such postings.
   (M)   The equipment shall be loaded on the vehicle in such a manner to
reduce to a minimum the excess over statutory size or weight limitations and
the least width or length dimensions of the load becomes the width of the load
on the trailer. Striking or damage to any structure or facility will be
perceived to be noncompliance with this section and will result in termination
of a permit.
   (N)   The Dubois County Highway Department may temporarily suspend or revoke
an oversized/overweight moving permit, either in its entirety or in respect to
certain of its provisions, due to seasonal conditions, other special
conditions, or if it is in the interest of the public's safety.
   (O)   The vehicle shall not be loaded or unloaded within the outer shoulder
limits of any county road unless permitted by a law enforcement officer or the
Dubois County Highway Department.

establishment, retail food establishment, seasonal retail food establishment,
mobile retail food establishment, or temporary retail food establishment
operated by any person. When separate areas for food service or preparation are
located in one building, and are operated by one owner, the establishment shall
be considered as one establishment, and only one permit shall be required.
   (B)   Only persons who comply with the applicable requirements of this
section shall be entitled to receive and retain such a permit. A permit shall
be issued to any person upon application, and only after inspection of the bed
and breakfast establishment, retail food establishment, seasonal retail food

establishment, shall be for a term of one year, beginning January 1 and
expiring December 31 of the calendar year, and shall be renewed annually.
Failure to pay the fee for the renewal of a permit by December 15 of the

against the bed and breakfast establishment, or retail food establishment. The
delinquent fee shall be in addition to the annual fee.
   (D)   The permit for a seasonal retail food establishment shall be for a
term of not more than eight months in a calendar year, and shall be renewed

addition to the annual fee. Each mobile retail food establishment shall be
permitted and charged a fee. The type of permit and fee will be determined by
the County Health Department.
      (1)   Mobile retail food establishment units shall operate from a

a separate operating license and fee is required for each commissary.
      (2)   Mobile retail food establishments shall provide proof of a permit
for the commissary if the commissary is not located in the county. Commissaries
operating in jurisdictions not requiring an individual permit shall not be

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.01 PURPOSE; RATIONALE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general
welfare of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses within the county. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation, or restriction, on the content, or
reasonable access, to any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone, or legitimize, the distribution
of obscene material.
   (B)   Rationale and findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the Board of Commissioners, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing
constructions incorporated in the cases of:
      (1)   Ginsburg V. U.S., 383 US 463 (1966); Ginsburg V. State, 390 US 629

State, 461 NE 2d 744 (IN. 1984);
      (2)   Based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in, and
around, sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to: Austin,
Texas, 1997 and 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana, 1984; Garden Grove, California,
1991; Houston, Texas, 1983 and 1997; Phoenix, Arizona, 1979 and 1995-98; Los
Angeles, California, 1977; Whittier, California, 1978; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
1992 and 1986; Dallas, Texas, 1997; Amarillo, Texas, 1977; New York, New York
Times Square, 1980 and 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General’s Working
Group On The Regulation of Sexually-Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State
of Minnesota); Environmental Research Group of Philadelphia (March 31, 1996);
Tucson, Arizona, 1990; Beaumont, Texas, 1982; and One Slip, New York, 1980; and
      (3)   Based upon a review of state statutes, including I.C. 22-14-3-1,
I.C. 35-45-4-1, I.C. 35-49-1-9, I.C. 35-49-2-1, I.C. 35-49-3-2, and other
statutes, the Board of Commissioners finds:
         (a)   Sexually-oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but
not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation;
         (b)   Sexually-oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually-oriented businesses to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses, and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually-oriented businesses in one area; and
         (c)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/
or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary
effects, which is the county’s rationale for this chapter, exists independent
of any comparative analysis between sexually-oriented and non-sexually-oriented
businesses. Additionally, the county’s interest in regulating sexually-oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually-oriented businesses that may locate in the county. The county
finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

action, to the applicant or licensee (respondent) by personal delivery or

of due process and proper administration of justice. The Board of Commissioners
shall issue a written decision, including specific reasons for the decision
pursuant to this chapter, to the respondent within five days after the hearing.
Ten days after the Board issues its written decision, said decision shall be

      (2)   If the decision is to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, the
decision shall include a statement advising the respondent of the right to
appeal, or challenge, such decision in a court of competent jurisdiction. If
the Board of Commissioners’ decision finds that no grounds exist for denial,
suspension, or revocation of the license, the Board of Commissioners shall,
contemporaneously with the issuance of the decision, order the Administrator to
immediately withdraw the intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, and to
notify the respondent, in writing by certified mail, of such action. If the
respondent is not yet licensed, the Administrator shall contemporaneously
therewith issue the license to the applicant.
   (B)   If any court action challenging the Board of Commissioners’ decision
is initiated, the Board of Commissioners shall prepare, and transmit to the
court, a transcript of the hearing within ten days after receiving written
notice of the filing of the court action. The Board of Commissioners shall
consent to expedited briefing and/or disposition of the action, shall comply
with any expedited schedule set by the court, and shall facilitate prompt
judicial review of the proceedings. The following shall apply to any sexually-
oriented business that is lawfully in operation, in all respects, as of the
effective date of this chapter: Upon the filing of any court action to appeal,
challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the county’s enforcement of the
denial, suspension, or revocation, the county shall immediately issue the

upon the court’s entry of a judgment on the respondent’s appeal, or other
action to restrain, or otherwise enjoin, the county’s enforcement.

proceedings as may be authorized by other provisions of this chapter, or any of
the laws or ordinances in force in the county, or to exempt anyone violating
this chapter, or any part of the said laws, from any penalty which may be
incurred.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 6-19-2006)
§ 112.29 EXISTING BUSINESSES; APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter is necessary to the immediate preservation of the public health

sexually-oriented businesses lawfully operating in all respects, and all
sexually-oriented business employees working in a lawfully operating sexually-
oriented business, on the effective date of this chapter, are hereby granted a

license for a period of 30 days following the effective date of this chapter.
By the end of said 30 days, all sexually-oriented businesses, and sexually-

During said 30 days, all requirements of this chapter, except for the
requirement of obtaining a license, shall be in full force and effect.

   (A)   It is unlawful for a sexually-oriented business to knowingly violate
the following regulations, or to knowingly allow an employee, or any other
person, to violate the following regulations:
      (1)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a patron, employee, or
any other person to knowingly, or intentionally, in a sexually-oriented
business, appear in a state of nudity, regardless of whether such public nudity
is expressive in nature;
      (2)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a person to knowingly,
or intentionally, in a sexually-oriented business, appear in a semi-nude
condition, unless the person is an employee who, while semi-nude, remains at
least six feet from any patron or customer, and on a stage at least 18 inches
from the floor in a room of at least 1,000 square feet;
      (3)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any employee who
regularly appears semi-nude in a sexually-oriented business to knowingly, or
intentionally, touch a customer, or the clothing of a customer, on the premises
of a sexually-oriented business;
      (4)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to sell,
use, possess, or consume alcoholic beverages on the premises of a sexually-

§ 112.31 PROOF OF VIOLATION, BUSINESS LICENSEE LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not impose strict liability. Unless a culpable mental
state is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing, or reckless,
mental state is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this
chapter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this
chapter, an act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension, or
revocation, of that employee’s license shall be imputed to the sexually-
oriented business licensee for purposes of finding a violation of this chapter,
or for purposes of license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an
officer, director, or general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or
controlled the operation of the business premises, knowingly, or recklessly,
allowed such act to occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability
that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

§ 112.32 FAILURE OF COUNTY; APPLICANT LICENSEE RIGHTS.
   In the event that a county official is required to take an act, or do a
thing, pursuant to this chapter within a prescribed time, and fails to take
such act, or do such thing, within the time prescribed, said failure shall not
prevent the exercise of constitutional rights of an applicant or licensee. If
the act required of the county official under this chapter, and not completed
in the time prescribed, includes the approval of condition(s) necessary for
approval by the county of an applicant’s, or licensee’s, application for a
sexually-oriented business license, or a sexually-oriented business employee’s
license (including a renewal), the condition shall be deemed met the day after
the deadline for the county’s action has passed.

§ 112.33 LOCATION.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated a
sexually-oriented business in the county, unless said sexually-oriented
business is at least:
      (1)   One thousand feet from any parcel occupied by another sexually-
oriented business, or by a business licensed by the state to sell alcohol at
the premises; and
      (2)   One thousand feet from any parcel occupied by any church, public or
private elementary or secondary school, daycare center or preschool, public
park, or any residence.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a
straight line in all directions without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the nearest portion of any building or structure on the premises
where the sexually-oriented business is located to the closest property line of
the property containing the church, public or private elementary or secondary
school, daycare center or preschool, public park, or any residence.
   (C)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any county ordinance, a
non-conforming sexually-oriented business lawfully existing in all respects
under law prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to operate
for one year following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of
its investment in its current location. At the conclusion of said one year, the
use will no longer be recognized as a lawful non-conforming use, provided that
a non-conforming sexually-oriented business may apply for one, or more, six-
month extensions of the original one-year period upon a showing of financial
hardship. An application for an initial extension based upon a showing of
financial hardship (“hardship extension”) shall be made at least 60 days before
the conclusion of the aforementioned one-year period. If a hardship extension
is granted, subsequent applications for hardship extensions shall be made at
least 60 days before the conclusion of the non-conforming sexually-oriented
business’s current extension period.
   (D)   An application for a hardship extension shall be filed, in writing,
with the Administrator, and shall include evidence of purchase and improvement
costs, income earned and lost, depreciation, and costs of relocation. Within
ten days after receiving the application, the Administrator shall schedule a
public hearing on the application before the Board of Commissioners, which
public hearing shall be conducted within 30 days after the Administrator’s
receipt of the application. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing
shall be published at least ten days before the hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation published within the county, and shall contain the
particular location for which the hardship extension is requested. The Board of
Commissioners shall issue a written decision within ten days after the public
hearing on the application for a hardship extension. The hardship extension
shall be granted upon a showing that the non-conforming sexually-oriented
business is unable, absent the extension, to make a reasonable recoupment of
its investment in its currently lawful, non-conforming use location.

objects used to penetrate the skin.
      CUTTING. A method of extreme body modification and scarification which

method.
      DEPARTMENT. The County Health Department.
      DERMAL PUNCHING. A method of creating piercings in the body, which

techniques, to produce scars on the human body for decorative purposes.
Examples of SCARIFICATION methods include branding, cutting, and skin peeling.

which consists of cutting on the human body the outline of a design and
removing the center, thereby creating a scar where the skin was removed.

from, hooks pierced through the flesh in various places around the body.
      TONGUE BIFURCATION. A non-surgical process in which the tongue is split
with the use of lasers or nylon material.
      TONGUE SPLITTING. A surgical procedure in which the tongue is cut

of performing branding, cutting, dermal punching, implantation, scarification,
skin peeling, tongue splitting, suspension piercing, or any other extreme body

UNIFORM NUMBERING SYSTEM FOR HOUSES
§ 150.20 PURPOSE.
   A plan for the orderly and systematic numbering of houses and structures
located within the jurisdictional area of the Board of Commissioners is hereby
enacted (herein after, “Uniform Numbering System”). Any and all ordinances
previously adopted by the Board of Commissioners regarding the numbering of
houses and structures are hereby deemed repealed.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.21 RELATION TO HEALTH, WELFARE.
   The numbering of houses, and other structures, in an orderly and systematic
manner will make the location for such houses, and structures, more expeditious
in cases of fire emergencies, in situations involving immediate need for
medical attention for members of the family or occupants of a building, and in
instances where police protection may be required with haste. An orderly and
systematic house numbering process will also enhance the delivery of goods and
services, as well as increase the efficiency of operations, such as postal
delivery.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.22 CONFORMITY.
   From the effective date of this subchapter, the numbering of all houses and
structures located on lots, or parcels of land, abutting public streets, or
roads, within the jurisdictional area of the Board of Commissioners shall be
accomplished in conformity with the Uniform Numbering System as herein
described. At the time of issuance of any permit for the construction of a
house or structure, a number shall be assigned by the designated county agency
to said house or structure as hereinafter provided. Such number shall be
included on the permit, and no permit authorizing the occupancy of a house or
structure shall be issued, and no final inspection of a building performed for
the purpose of permitting its occupancy shall be deemed complete unless such
house or structure displays, at the time of inspection, the officially assigned
number in full compliance with the standards of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.23 BASE LINES, SEQUENCES.
   (A)   The base lines for the Uniform Numbering System shall be as described
below, and numbers shall be assigned in each of the four cardinal directions,
increasing from zero at the point of intersection of the base lines.
      (1)   The east and west base line shall be the line dividing township 1
south and township 2 south.
      (2)   The north and south base line shall be the line dividing range 4
west and range 5 west.
   (B)   The general rule shall be 500 numbers to one-half mile, except in
certain areas where the irregular direction of the county highways makes
variations necessary.
   (C)   All streets and roads, and parts thereof, running north and south
shall add either the word “North” or “South” to the end of their official name,
as is appropriate for their location in relationship to the described east and
west base line in division (A)(1) above. All streets and roads, and parts
thereof, running east and west shall add either the word “East” or “West” to
the end of their official name, as is appropriate for their location in
relationship to the described north and south base line in division (A)(2)
above.
   (D)   All streets and roads, and parts thereof, that run at an angle, or in
a curved manner in relationship to the four cardinal directions, shall be
considered, and have assigned to their name, the one cardinal direction in
which they predominately traverse in the county.
   (E)   Even numbers shall be assigned to the east side of north and south
streets and roads, and the south side of east and west streets and roads. Odd
numbers shall be assigned to the west side of north and south streets and
roads, and the north side of east and west streets and roads.
   (F)   The official name of each street or road within the jurisdictional
area of the Board of Commissioners shall be established by said Board.

   The Board of Commissioners shall designate a county department, or a county
officer or employee, which shall act as the administrative office (hereinafter
“administrative office”) in charge of issuing numbers to houses or structures
in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter. The administrative office
shall issue numbers to all new houses or structures, renumber houses and
structures whenever it becomes necessary to do so in the implementation of the
Uniform Numbering System, and cause the numbering of all existing homes or
structures which are not numbered to be numbered in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter. Barns, sheds, and outbuildings not used for a
habitation, or business, shall not be numbered.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.25 NUMBERS OTHER THAN ON PUBLIC STREETS, ROADS.
   The administrative office may, if it deems proper and necessary for the
implementation of the Uniform Numbering System, assign numbers to houses or
structures that are situated on private streets, or roads, within the
jurisdictional area of the Board of Commissioners.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.26 STANDARDS FOR POSTING OF HOUSE NUMBERS.
   The owner, or occupant, of a house or structure located within the
jurisdictional area of the Board of Commissioners shall post officially
assigned numbers in a location providing easy identification from the abutting
street or road. Such numbers shall be a minimum of three inches in height, and
shall contrast with the background on which placed. If the house or structure
is located more than 75 feet from the roadway, then the numbers shall also be
attached to a fixture near the street or road, and be visible from both
directions. Said fixture may be a roadside rural mailbox. If the house or
structure is located less than 75 feet from the roadway, and a roadside fixture
is not used, the number must be affixed in a clearly visible location on the
front of the house or structure. Each unit of a multi-family dwelling shall be
addressed separately.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.27 RENUMBERING OF HOUSES, STRUCTURES.
   Houses and structures that were numbered prior to the effective date of this
subchapter shall be renumbered in order that the same may comply with the
Uniform Numbering System, and so that the numerical harmony throughout an area,
or areas, is substantially achieved. The administrative office shall authorize
such changes.
(Ord. 2000-1, passed 4-17-2000)
§ 150.28 NOTIFICATION OF LOCAL AGENCIES.
   The administrative office shall provide a uniform system of notification of
the issuance of numbers, or the renumbering of houses and structures.
Notifications shall be made reasonably ahead of impending changes so as to
allow major interested groups and agencies to plan, and to prepare, for the
proposed changes. The administrative office shall keep accurate records and
shall, from time to time, prepare and make available to the County Board of
Commissioners a report of the status of the implementation of the Uniform
Numbering System. In the assignment of house numbers, the administrative office
shall use its best judgment, and shall carefully consider, and evaluate, all
contingencies, and shall, with due regard to the sensitive nature of the job
assigned to it, be considerate of the citizens of the county.

foot, and bearings to half minutes, these boundaries to be determined by an
accurate survey in the field, which shall be balanced and closed;
      (2)   The exact location and dedication of roads and rights-of-way, on or
adjoining the site, including dedicated widths, roadway widths, and widths of
pavements, name, and other pertinent data:
         (a)   All new proposed roads intersecting with existing public
roadways shall be reviewed, and approved, by the County Engineer, for sight
distance and proper drainage structures. The review may be established with an
application for drainage structures in the county right-of-way; and
         (b)   All lots directly accessing an existing public road will have an
approved driveway access, which may be obtained with an application for
drainage structures in the county right-of-way.
      (3)   Easements showing locations, widths, and purposes, including
utility easements, and the dedication thereof;

for development, have been, and will be, complied with, that all roads and
easements shown on said plat are thereby dedicated to the public, and that lots
or parcels transferred will have the size and area shown on the plat;
   (F)   A certificate by the engineer, or qualified surveyor, that the
information contained on the plat is true and correct; and
   (G)   A certificate for approval by the County Board of Commissioners for a
major subdivision, or a certificate for approval by the Subdivision Review
Committee for a minor subdivision. Approval of the plat shall not be deemed to
be an acceptance of the dedication, nor as an acceptance of any road or
easement into the county highway system.
(Ord. 2018-03, passed 4-17-2018)
§ 151.09 STANDARDS.
   In addition to other standards set forth in this subchapter, in establishing
and laying out a subdivision, the owner shall comply with those standards of
development, principles, and requirements set forth in divisions (A) through
(I) below.
   (A)   Plat conformance. In determining whether an application for approval
shall be granted, the County Board of Commissioners, or the S.R.C., shall
determine if the plat conforms to the principles and standards required in this
subchapter.
   (B)   Streets.
      (1)   Each lot or parcel shall abut a dedicated public street or road.
      (2)   Each lot or parcel in a subdivision shall use a dedicated public
right-of-way as its primary means of ingress and egress.
      (3)   Except as provided in division (B)(8) below, each street or road
shall be constructed to the minimum design and width standards adopted for the
county out of the INDOT standard specifications:
         (a)   All roads shall be 20 feet wide with two-foot gravel shoulders
on each side, and with four feet of additional earth shoulder adjacent to each
gravel shoulder, all to be centered within a 60-foot public right-of-way;
         (b)   The road shall have a minimum eight inches of compacted rock
base, composed of not less than four inches of INDOT approved #2 rock and not
less than four inches of INDOT approved #53 rock over the top; and
         (c)   The road surface shall be a minimum of double chip and seal,
unless as otherwise directed by the County Board of Commissioners.
      (4)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned, or platted roads, with
which they are to connect.
      (5)   The owner may be required to extend a proposed road to the boundary
line of the tract to be subdivided when, in the opinion of the County Board of
Commissioners, such extension is desirable and in the best interest of the
county highway system.
      (6)   Proposed roads shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography, and other limiting factors of good design, permit, but
not less than 70 degrees in any case.
      (7)   Wherever there exists, adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, a
dedicated, or platted and recorded, half-width road, the other half-width of
such road shall be included in the subject plat; otherwise, half-roads shall be
prohibited.
      (8)   (a)   Roads shall be completed as shown on the plat, as approved by
the County Board of Commissioners, and shall be graded, surfaced with rock, and
improved to the dimensions, and the work shall be performed in the manner
prescribed by the then current county standards for the road constructions.
Prior to the placement of road surfaces, adequate subsurface drainage for the
road shall be provided by the subdivider. The person creating the subdivision
shall be obligated to place a minimum of double chip and seal surface, or a
surface as directed by the County Board of Commissioners, on any new road
established on the plat when three, or more, of the lots bordering newly
established road(s) have been conveyed. The covenants contained in the plat of
said subdivision shall clearly indicate this obligation.
         (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this division (B)(8), in the
event of a single lot platted subdivision, or in the event of any subdivision
having no lot containing less than three acres, access to such single lot (and
solely to said lot), or to each such lot of three acres or greater, may be an
unimproved road that satisfies dedication and easement requirements of this
subchapter, but is not required to be improved to county standards. This
unimproved road shall have its own original name approved by the County
Surveyor, shall be able to handle all emergency vehicles, and shall have a
maintenance agreement between the property owners in the platted subdivision,
and with adjoining property owners, if the access to the property is by the
platted roadway, stating how the road is to be maintained, and whose
responsibility it is to maintain.
      (9)   Fences, hedges, retaining walls, lattice-work screens, trees,
flowers, plants, permanent mail boxes, nameplates, lamp posts, bird baths, bird
houses, benches, and landscaping of a like nature are permitted in any required
front, side, or rear yard, provided they are not located on a public right-of-
way. However, on any corner tract, nothing shall be erected, placed, or planted
in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two and a
half and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets, in
the area bounded by the street right-of-way lines of the corner tract, and a
line joining two points on the street right-of-way lines 35 feet from the point
of their intersection. Except for mail boxes constructed on breakaway posts and
government road signs, no signs, or other structure, shall be placed on, or
project over, a public right-of-way.
      (10)   If sidewalks are desired to be located within the public right-of-
way by the developer, then they are to be constructed by the developer, and
maintained by the property owner per §
150.01.
   (C)   Lots or parcels.
      (1)   The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for
the location of the proposed subdivision, and for the type of development
contemplated.
      (2)   Each lot or parcel shall abut on a dedicated public street or road.
      (3)   The minimum lot size shall be able to fit all of the minimum
standards set forth in this subchapter, with a minimum road frontage of 60 feet
at the road right-of-way, and a front yard minimum width of 115 feet at the
building setback line; provided, however, that should a lot be served by a
public sanitary sewer system, the minimum size shall be 10,000 square feet with
a minimum front width of 80 feet. A lot not served by a public sanitary sewer
system, while complying with this subchapter, may not comply with the minimum
requirements of state and/or county statutes, ordinances, or regulations for
private sanitary system requirements, and therefore may not be acceptable for
certain buildings or use purposes.
   (D)   Easements.
      (1)   Where alleys are not provided, easements for utilities shall be
provided. Such easements, when not located adjacent to a public road, shall
have minimum widths of 20 feet; and when located adjacent to a public road,
shall have a minimum combined width of 20 feet along said road. Where located
between adjacent lots, half the 20-foot width may be taken from each lot.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel, or stream, adequate areas for storm water, or drainage easements,
shall be allocated for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving,
or protecting said watercourses, in accordance with the requirements of the
County Drainage Board.
      (3)   Where a new public road is being proposed as part of a subdivision,
a utility easement having a minimum width of ten feet shall be located adjacent
to each side of that public road, but if said new road is on the perimeter of a
subdivision, and no easement is possible on both sides thereof, then the
minimum easement width shall be 20 feet on the subdivision side of said road.
   (E)   Building setback lines. 
      (1)   Building setback lines, as to any lot or parcel, shall be set forth
on the plat, and shall have the following minimum distance from the lot line:
         (a)   Front yard: 35 feet from the right-of-way line;
         (b)   Side yard: ten feet on each side; and
         (c)   Rear yard: 20 feet from rear line.
      (2)   Corner lots shall have the front yard setback lines specified on
all sides fronting a dedicated right-of-way.
   (F)   Air, stream pollution. Due consideration shall be given to the
prevention of air and stream pollution, proper treatment, and disposal of
refuse and other waste, and the elimination of other blighting characteristics,
including the following elements:
      (1)   No use shall produce erosion, or other pollutants, in such quantity
as to be detrimental to adjacent properties, and conflict with water pollution
standards established by the public agencies;
      (2)   No use shall accumulate within the property, or discharge beyond
the property lines, any waste matter, whether liquid or solid, in violation of
applicable public health, safety, and welfare standards and regulations;
      (3)   All tracts not connected to, or served by, a public or private
water system already approved by a state, county, or city health authority
shall have written approval from the County Health Department, or the State
Board of Health, before construction thereon of any structure requiring water;
and
      (4)   All tracts not connected to, or served by, a public or private
sanitary sewer system already approved by a state, county, or city health
authority shall have written approval from the County Health Department, or the
State Board of Health, before construction thereon of any structure requiring
sewage disposal.
   (G)   Subdivision layout. The subdivision layout shall be of such a
character that it protects the health, safety, and general welfare of the
county and its citizens.
   (H)   Exceptions, modification. In any particular case where the subdivider
can show that, by reason of exceptional topographic or other physical
conditions, or because of an unusually large or small subdivision, or when made
for industrial or commercial purposes, strict compliance with any requirement
of these regulations would cause practical difficulty, or exceptional or undue
hardship, the County Board of Commissioners may relax such requirement to the
extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship,
provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good, and
without impairing the intent, and purpose, of these regulations, or the
desirable general development of the neighborhood and the community. Any
modification thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the County Board
of Commissioners, setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Board,
justified the modification.
   (I)   Mobile home park. Any mobile home park which holds a license issued by
the State Board of Health under I.C. 16-41-27-18 shall be exempt from the
provisions of this section.
(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-2-2018) Penalty, see §

§ 151.10 NON-CONFORMING CONDITIONS.
   If a lawful structure, or structure and land in combination, or division of
land exists at the effective date of the adoption, or amendment, of this
subchapter, that would not be permitted under the terms of this subchapter,
that non-conforming condition may be continued, provided, however, any
extension, reduction, or further division, shall not be subsequently permitted
unless in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 151.11 PARCELIZATION.

151.01 through
151.10 set forth in this subchapter, where the owner wishes to convey a parcel
of land, either with or without consideration, to a potential resident from the
general public for the purpose of locating a residence, said owner may be
authorized by the County Board of Commissioners, or the S.R.C., to convey said
parcel as an exception from the plat provisions of this subchapter. Any
exception thus authorized is required to be entered in the minutes of the
County Board of Commissioners, or on a document executed by the S.R.C., and

§ 151.12 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The County Board of Commissioners are hereby authorized, and
empowered, to grant exemptions to the terms of this subchapter, as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions fully
demonstrated on the basis of the facts presented, strict compliance with
specific provisions of this subchapter will result in extreme practical
difficulties, or undue misuse of property.
   (B)   The following are exemptions that the County Board of Commissioners
have agreed to authorize, provided the exceptions are not for new residential
construction:
      (1)   Utility exemption. In the case of the division of property under
200 square feet for the sole purpose of a public utility company’s equipment
placement;

      (3)   Existing home exemption. Existing houses with a permanent
foundation constructed prior to previous subdivision ordinances, and currently
in a livable state, may be divided off from the parent parcel with a minimum of
one acre going with the home; and/or
