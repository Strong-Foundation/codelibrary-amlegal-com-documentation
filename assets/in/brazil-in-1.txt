§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Brazil Town Code,”
for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances,” or “code”
may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not constitute
any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct

the error.

be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication

wheelchairs.

(Ord. 9-2009, passed 10-13-2008)
§ 30.39 HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Harassment policy. The city is committed to providing a work
environment that is free of all forms of discrimination and conduct that can be
considered harassing, coercive or disruptive, including sexual harassment.
Actions, words, jokes or comments based on an individual’s sex, race, color,
national origin, age, religion, disability or any other legally protected
characteristic will not be tolerated. The city provides ongoing sexual
harassment training to ensure the opportunity to work in an environment free of
sexual and other unlawful harassment.
   (B)   Scope. This policy applies to all city employees and all third parties
on city premises.
   (C)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees
have the right to work in an environment free from sexual and other unlawful
harassment.
   (D)   Definition.
      SEXUAL HARASSMENT. Unwanted sexual advances or visual, verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature. This definition includes many forms of offensive
behavior and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same sex as
the harasser. The following is a partial list of sexual harassment examples:
         (a)   Unwanted sexual advances;
         (b)   Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;
         (c)   Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to
sexual advances;
         (d)   Visual conduct that includes leering, making sexual gestures or
displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters;
         (e)   Verbal conduct that includes making or using derogatory
comments, epithets, slurs or jokes;
         (f)   Verbal sexual advances or propositions;
         (g)   Verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries
about an individual’s body, sexually degrading words used to describe an
individual, or suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations; and
         (h)   Physical conduct that includes touching, assaulting or impeding
or blocking movements. Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical),
requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature constitute sexual harassment when:
            1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of employment;
            2.   Submission or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for
making employment decisions; or
            3.   The conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
   (E)   Procedure.
      (1)   All allegations of sexual harassment reported will be quickly and
discreetly investigated. To the extent possible, the confidentiality of the
person making the report and that of any witnesses and the alleged harasser
will be protected. Concerns and reports may be made without fear of reprisal or
retaliation.
      (2)   If an employee should experience or witness sexual or other
unlawful harassment, he or she shall immediately do one or both of the
following.
         (a)   Take action to stop the harassment. While the employee is not
obligated to confront the person, he or she may choose to speak privately with
the person initiating the offending conduct and ask him or her to stop. It is
helpful to provide the person with the reasons why the conduct is offensive, as
he or she may be unaware of its impact. If the conduct stops, the employee may
choose not to report the incident. If he or she believes it would be
inappropriate to contact that person, he or she should immediately contact his
or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable, the Human Resources/Safety
Director or the Mayor may be contacted. The time, place and nature of the
complaint should be relayed to the person contacted. The complaint must be made
in written form. The Humane Resources/Safety Director will, in cooperation with
the Mayor, investigate the complaint and take appropriate action. When the
investigation is completed, the person filing the complaint will be informed of
its outcome.
         (b)   Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual
or other unlawful harassment must immediately advise the Humane Resources/
Safety Director or the Mayor’s office so it can be investigated in a timely and
confidential manner.
      (3)   Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including termination. Appropriate action will be taken
against third party violators.
   (F)   False accusations procedures. The city recognizes that false
accusations of harassment and sexual harassment can have a serious effect on
innocent men and women. Individuals falsely accusing another of harassment or
sexual harassment will be disciplined in accordance with the nature and extent
of his or her false accusation. Discipline may include termination.

disinterested, qualified and licensed real estate appraisers who shall each
submit to the Board a written appraisal of the same.
   (C)   The Board shall have the real estate inspected for possible

public use or purpose of the land, inspections to be conducted by qualified
persons or experts in real estate inspections.
   (D)   The Board shall do or have performed a complete title search so as to
determine whether the city will receive good and marketable title to the real
estate to be donated. The donation must be refused and denied by the Board if
clear and marketable title cannot be shown by the benefactor.
   (E)   If acquisition of the real estate is deemed to be in the best
interests of the city, the Board shall adopt a resolution to acquire ownership
interest in that real estate by donation and specify therein the public use or
purpose for acquiring the real estate, the appraised values thereof, the legal
description and common address of the real estate, that the real estate is fit
for the designated public use or purpose and that the benefactor has clear and
marketable title to convey to the city.
   (F)   If a resolution is adopted by the Board, that resolution must be
submitted to the Common Council for final acceptance and approval before the
real estate can be acquired.
   (G)   Once the Common Council has approved the resolution, the Board may
proceed to accept conveyance of the property at a public meeting thereof.
(Prior Code, § 32.51) (Ord. 5-1993, passed 2-23-1993)
§ 30.52 PURCHASE OF PROPERTY WITHOUT A DECLARED PUBLIC PURPOSE OR USE.
   Neither the Board of Public Works and Safety, the Common Council, any
elected or appointed official or employee of the city may purchase or authorize
the purchase or receive by donation, on behalf of the city, any real estate
without full compliance with the provisions and requirements of this
subchapter, and if there is no declared public use or purpose for the real
estate to be acquired, any acquisition in violation of this subchapter shall
entitle either the Board or the Common Council to void the acquisition by
resolution.
(Prior Code, § 32.53) (Ord. 5-1993, passed 2-23-1993)
§ 30.53 EMINENT DOMAIN SUPERSEDES.
   Nothing in this section or subchapter shall take precedence over the
authority of the city to acquire property by eminent domain as set forth in
applicable state statutes and law of the state.

FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 35.050 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefits both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures,
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets and
equipment purchased having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of, or addition to, the
government’s general fixed assets.
   FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating
activities of the unit that are relatively permanent and are needed for the
production or sale of goods and services and are termed property, plant and
equipment of fixed assets. These assets are not held for sale in the ordinary
course of business. This broad group is usually separated into classes
according to the physical characteristics of the physical characteristics of
the items (e.g., land, infrastructure, buildings, improvements other than
buildings, machinery and equipment and construction in progress).
   HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods and services
at the examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute.
   IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS.
      (1)   Improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached or not easily
removed, and having a life expectancy of greater than two years. Examples are
walks, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls,
pools, outside fountains, planters, underground sprinkler systems and other
similar items.
      (2)   IMPROVEMENTS do not include roads, street or assets that are of
value only to the public. For example, Main Street is a public street with
greatest value to the public. Roads or drives upon city-owned land that provide
support to the city’s facilities are assets.
      (3)   A sidewalk down the road for public enjoyment is an infrastructure
improvement and is not capitalized. However, sidewalks installed upon city-
owned land for use by the public and for the support of the city’s facility are
capital assets.
   INFRASTRUCTURE. The basic facilities, services and installations needed for
the functioning of a community or society, such as transportation and
communication systems and water and power lines. Infrastructure shall include,
but is not limited to, roads, streets, street lighting systems, bridges,
overpasses, sidewalks, curbs, parking meter, street signs, viaducts, wharfs,
storm and sewer water collection systems and drinking water systems.
INFRASTRUCTURE shall not include driveways or parking lots.
   LAND. Specified land, lots, parcels or acreage, including rights-of-way,
owned by the city, its various departments, boards or authorities, regardless
of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will not be included as the
city does not own them, but as an interest in land owned by another (i.e.,
property owner) that entitles its holder to a specified limited use.
   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. An apparatus, tool or conglomeration of pieces to
form a tool. The tool will stand-alone and not become a part of a basic
structure of building. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one unit
with a total value greater than the limit will be one unit.
   TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical
senses. This may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and
smelled.

affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works;

CHARGES AND FEES
§ 52.080 SEWER CHARGES BASED ON WATER USAGE.
   (A)   Water obtained from the municipal water utility. The sewer charges
made for sewerage service rendered to each lot, parcel of real estate or
building having any connection with the city’s sewerage system or otherwise
discharging sewage into that system, either directly or indirectly, shall be
based on the quantity of water presumed to enter the public sewers after being
used in or on the property, as the quantity is measured by the water meter or
meters therein used by the municipal water utility, except as herein otherwise
provided.
   (B)   Water obtained from other sources. Where the property obtains any part
or all of the water used from sources other than the municipal water utility,
the owner or the tenant may be required by the city to install and maintain at
his or her own expense a meter acceptable to the city for the purpose of
measuring the quantity of water obtained from these other sources, or the city
may determine the quantity of such water by whatever means and methods it may
find practicable.
   (C)   Exempt water. Where a significant portion of the metered water does
not and cannot enter the sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and
where the quantity of water entering the premises averages more than 20,000
gallons (2,674 cubic feet) per month, the person having charge of the property
may request permission from the city to install at his or her own expense
either an approved meter to determine the quantity of water that cannot enter
the sewerage system or an approved sewage-measuring device or devices to
determine the volume of sewage that actually enters the sewerage system; when
appropriate, the city reserves the right to determine by whatever other means
and methods it may find practicable the percentage of the property’s metered
water that enters the sewerage system. In any case the user charge shall be
applied to the quantity of water that can or actually does enter the public
sewers.
   (D)   Metering of sewage. The city may require a user to install and
maintain at his or her own expense an approved device to measure directly the
volumes of wastes discharged to the sewerage system if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Any
nonresidential user whose monthly water consumption is 2,000 gallons (267 cubic
feet) or more shall install a meter. The city shall inspect and approve the
installations and no service, once installed, shall be removed without the
city’s approval
(Prior Code, § 52.085) (Ord. 2-2007, passed 1-23-2007) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.081 SEWER CHARGES.
   (A)   For the use of and service rendered by the sewage works, sewer charges
shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real estate
or building that is or could be connected to the city’s sewerage system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sewerage system of the city,
which sewer charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an
amount determinable as follows:
 
Total Monthly Sewer Charge per 100 Cubic Feet (748 Gallons)
$9.86
 
   (B)   The minimum monthly charge for any metered user shall be:
 
Monthly Minimum Sewer Charge
$24.65
 
   (C)   For the use of and services rendered to the K&H Sewer District, the
sewer charges shall be in an amount determinable as follows:
 
Total Monthly Sewer Charge per 100 Cubic Feet (748 Gallons)
$2.84
 
   (D)   The minimum charge for any service where the user is not a metered
water user shall be based on the size of the service connection but no charge
shall be less than the minimum monthly or bi-monthly charge.
   (E)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city’s
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the minimum charge and the sewage rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or building
served through the single water meter.
   (F)   In the event two or more dwelling units, such as trailers, apartments
or housekeeping rooms, discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into
the city’s sanitary system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water
and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such
case billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere
herein, except that an additional charge shall be added thereto in the amount
of $2.45 per month for each dwelling unit over one served through the single
water meter. In the case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling units shall
be interpreted as the maximum capacity for trailers in the park, plus any other
dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted
as a room or other living space or spaces in which cooking facilities are
provided.
   (G)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the
minimum charge and in the sewer charge as may be equitable.
   (H)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be subject to the
same sewer charges hereinabove provided or to sewer charges established in
harmony therewith.
(Prior Code, § 52.086) (Ord. 2-2007, passed 1-23-2007; Ord. 17-2009, passed 12-
30-2009; Ord. 12-2012, passed 9-19-2012)
§ 52.082 STRENGTH-OF-WASTE SURCHARGE.
   (A)   Liability for surcharge. Each industrial or nonindustrial user who
discharges wastes into the sewerage system shall be subject to a surcharge, in
addition to the regular sewer charges, based on both the biochemical oxygen
demand (or on the chemical oxygen demand where BOD cannot be determined) and
the suspended solids content of the wastes, if these wastes have a
concentration greater than the following:
      (1)   A biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter; or where
BOD cannot be determined, then, in lieu of BOD, a chemical oxygen/demand of 400
milligrams per liter; and
      (2)   A suspended solids content of 250 milligrams per liter.
   (B)   Computation of surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined as
follows: The excess pounds of BOD (or COD) and of suspended solids will each be
computed by first multiplying the customer’s billing sewage volume measured in
units of 100 cubic feet for the current billing period by the factor 0.0062321
and then multiplying this product by the difference between the concentrations
measured in milligrams per liter of the BOD (or COD) and of the suspended
solids respectively in the customer’s sewage and the allowed concentrations set
out in division (A) above. The surcharge for each constituent will then be
determined by multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the
appropriate rate of surcharge set out in division (C) below.
   (C)   Rates of surcharge. The rates of surcharge for each of the
aforementioned constituents shall be as follows:
 
Constituents                                                    Per Pound
For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)                             $0.12
For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where BOD cannot be determined $0.12
For suspended solids                                            $0.12
 
   (D)   Revision of rates of surcharge. Prior to May 1 of each year, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall submit to the Board of Public Works and Safety a
comparison of the calculated unit costs for removing BOD and suspended solids
from the wastewater treatment plant influent during the previous calendar year
with the unit charges currently in effect in order that the Board may determine
whether the current rates of surcharge are adequate or should be changed by the
Common Council.
(Prior Code, § 52.087) (Ord. 2-2007, passed 1-23-2007)
§ 52.083 BILLING OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Billing period. Sewer charges for sewerage service shall be prepared
and billed by the city and shall be due and payable as determined by the Board
of Public Works and Safety.
   (B)   Liability for payment. The sewer charges for sewerage service shall be
billed to the person being billed for water service unless, by contract with
the utility, another person assumes such responsibility. If a tenant is billed,
the owner shall in no way be relieved of liability in the event payment is not
made by the tenant as herein required. The owner shall have the right to
examine the city’s collection records to ascertain whether such charges have
been paid.
   (C)   First billings.
      (1)   The sewer charges and surcharges fixed in this subchapter shall be
extended to and cover any additional premises hereafter served without the need
for any hearing or notice. If the first billing to a new customer covers a
period other than a full billing period, then the sewer charges for such
billing shall be made in keeping with standard practice.
      (2)   Subsequent sewerage service billings shall be for periods
coinciding with the billing periods established by the Board of Public Works
and Safety.
      (3)   If the sewer charges or surcharges are changed, the first billing
after the change may also be for a period other than a full billing period.
(Prior Code, § 52.088) (Ord. 2-2007, passed 1-23-2007)
§ 52.084 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   How delinquencies arise. Charges for sewerage service levied pursuant
to this subchapter shall be due and payable on or before the due dates shown on
the bills. Any service charge not paid by the due date approximately 15 days
after the bill is rendered shall be considered delinquent. The delinquent
charge together with any applied penalty shall be collectible as hereinafter
set forth.
   (B)   Collection through the tax duplicate. As provided by the state
statutes, delinquent sewerage service charges may be made a lien against the
property served through certification to the County Auditor and to the County
Recorder. In such case, the delinquent service charges, together with the
mandatory penalty of 10%, shall be placed on the tax duplicate and be collected
in the same manner as regular taxes and assessments are collected.
   (C)   Collection through court actions. In addition to the foregoing
remedies, the city shall have the right, as provided by the state statutes, to
foreclose any lien established under the provisions of division (B) above, with
recovery of the charge, a penalty of 10% and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this chapter
on activities of the user.
   (B)   The Superintendent may also seek other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Prior Code, § 52.114) (Ord. 2-2007, passed 1-23-2007)
§ 52.105 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The

into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (E)   This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under state law.

waterworks water supply may be contaminated by the failure to close valves or
leaking check valves, and no auxiliary or secondary suction pipe to any
underwriters pump taking water from wells, streams or other sources whatever
will be permitted. Any fire protection system using water from wells, streams
or sources other than the waterworks service shall be kept separate from any
system supplied from the waterworks service.
(Prior Code, § 53.044) (Ord. 21-1931, passed 9-22-1931)
§ 53.044 INSPECTION; APPROVAL OF THE FIRE CHIEF; GUARANTEES.
   (A)   All fire service shall be subject to inspection by the waterworks from
time to time, and the consumer shall give the inspectors all reasonable
facilities for making the inspections and any information concerning the same
that the inspector or the waterworks may require. Care will always be taken
that inspections will be made with as little inconvenience to the consumer or
occupant as possible.
   (B)   All applications for private fire protection shall be subject to the
written approval of the Chief of the Fire Department, who, upon approval, shall
state that in his or her opinion the public fire protection will not be
endangered by the connection proposed to be made by the waterworks when
properly safeguarded by the placing of an indicator post valve as near the main
as possible, the valve to be under the control and orders of the Chief of the
Fire Department, at time of fires, with full authority to close the valve.
   (C)   The waterworks in no manner guarantees to furnish a proper quantity of
water through the fire protection service, nor does it undertake to guarantee
anything relative to the services, but it will endeavor to maintain the
efficiency of its service under all conditions. The granting of a permit for
private fire protection is under the express condition that the waterworks
shall not be considered or deemed in any manner to have undertaken to
extinguish fire or to protect any person or property against loss or damage by

system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being
serviced; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the
service line wherever the following conditions exist.
   (A)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not
or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the city waterworks, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the
degree of hazard.
   (B)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow
prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
   (C)   In the case of premises having internal cross-connection that cannot
be permanently corrected or controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping
arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises are not readily
accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible to
ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line or lines where
potential hazards could exist.

the city nuisance ordinance, i.e., this chapter, shall have the right to
contest the alleged ordinance violation by notifying the City Planning and
Zoning Administrator, who shall so inform the Board of Public Works and Safety
of the person’s request to be heard. If a hearing is requested, the Board of
Public Works and Safety shall then have a hearing on the alleged violation to
determine whether or not an ordinance violation has incurred prior to taking
action to remove or rebate.

publication costs to the County Auditor. This certification shall be in the
form of a sworn statement, showing the total cost and expense incurred,
including the expense of notice and/or publication, the expense of the work
done including the date of completion and the location of the property upon

be collected as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to the
General Fund of the city in administering this chapter. At the city’s
discretion, the certification and sworn statement may also be provided to the
County Recorder, which sworn statement shall constitute a lien and privilege on
the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due on
principal and interest, plus cost, if any, for collection, until payment has
been made, at which time a release of the lien shall be recorded.
      (3)   The costs and expenses shall be collected in the manner fixed by
law for the collection of real estate taxes and further shall be subject to a
delinquent penalty the same as real estate taxes in the event same is not paid
in full on or before the date the tax bill on which charges appears become
delinquent. Sworn statements recorded in accordance with the provisions hereof
shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been complied
with and that the work has been done properly and satisfactorily and shall be
full notice to every person concerned that the property designated or described
in the statement and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law.

(Ord. 6-2007, passed 6-26-2007)
§ 150.048 PERFORMANCE OF WORK REQUIRED BY ORDERS; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Building Administrator may cause the action by an order issued
under §
150.042(A)(2) to be performed in the following manner.
      (1)   (a)   If the work is being performed under an order other than an
order under §
150.042(A)(2), (A)(3) or (A)(4), and if the cost of this work is estimated to
be less than $10,000, the Board of Public Works and Safety, acting through the
Building Administrator or other agent, may perform the work by means of the
city’s own workers and equipment owned or leased by the city. Notice that this
work is to be performed must be given to all persons with a substantial
property interest, in the manner prescribed by this subchapter at least ten
days before the date of performance by the Building Administrator. This notice
must include a statement that an amount representing a reasonable estimate of
the cost incurred by the Building Administrator in processing the matter and
performing the work may, if not paid, be recorded after a hearing as a lien
against all persons having a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable
interest of a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises.
         (b)   If the work is being performed under an order issued under §
150.042(A)(2), (A)(3) or (A)(4), the work may be informed by a contractor who
has been awarded a base bid contract to perform the work for the Building
Administrator, or by the Building Administrator, or by any other governmental
agency, and using the city’s own workers and equipment owned or leased by the
city. Work performed under an order issued under §
150.042(A)(2), (A)(3) or (A)(4) may be performed without further notice to the
persons holding a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable interest of a
contract purchaser, and these persons are liable for the costs incurred by the
Building Administrator in processing the matter and performing the work. Bids
may be solicited and accepted for work on more than one property if the bid
reflects an allocation of the bid amount among the various unsafe premises in
proportion to the work to be accomplished. The part of the bid amount
attributable to each of the unsafe premises constitutes the basis for
calculating the part of the costs of the work.
      (2)   If the work is being performed under an order other than an order
under §
150.042(A)(2), and if the estimated costs of this work is $10,000 or more, this
work must be let at public bid to a contractor licensed and qualified under
law. This obligation to pay costs imposed by §
150.049 is based on the condition of the unsafe premises at the time the public
bid was accepted. Changes occurring in the condition of the unsafe premises
after the public bid was accepted do not eliminate or diminish this obligation.
      (3)   If the work is being performed under an order to seal an unsafe
building under §
150.042(A)(2), the work may be performed by a contractor who has been awarded a
base bid contract to seal unsafe buildings for the Building Administrator, or
by the city using its own workers and equipment owned or leased by it, the
unsafe building may be sealed without further notice to the persons holding a
fee interest or life estate interest, and these persons are liable for the cost
incurred by the Building Administrator in processing the matter and performing
the work, as provided by §
150.049.
   (B)   Bids may be solicited and accepted for work on more than one property
if the bid reflects an allocation of the bid amount among the various unsafe
premises in proportion to the work to be accomplished. The part of the bid
amount attributable to each of the unsafe premises constitutes the basis for
calculating the part of the costs described by §
150.049(A)(1).
   (C)   All persons who have a known or recorded substantial property interest
in the unsafe premises and are subject to an order other than an order under §
150.042(A)(2), (A)(3) or (A)(4) must be notified about the public bid in the
manner prescribed by §
150.055, by means of a written statement including:
      (1)   The name of the person to whom the order was issued;
      (2)   A legal description or address of the unsafe premises that are the
subject of the order:
      (3)   A statement that the contract is to be let at public bid to a
licensed contractor to accomplish work to comply with the order;
      (4)   A description of work to be accomplished;
      (5)   A statement that both the bid price of the licensed contractor who
accomplishes the work and amount representing a reasonable estimate of the
costs incurred by the Building Administrator in processing the matter of the
unsafe premises may, if not paid or recorded after a hearing as a lien against
all persons having a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable interest
of a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises;
      (6)   The time of the bid opening;
      (7)   The place of the bid opening; and
      (8)   The name, address and telephone number of the Building
Administrator.
   (D)   (1)   If the notice of the statement that public bids are to be let is
served by publication, the publication must include the information required by
division (B) above, except that it need only include a general description of
the work to be accomplished. The publication must also state that a copy of the
statement of public bid may be obtained from the Building Administrator.
      (2)   Notice of the statement that public bids are to let must be given
at least ten days before the date of the public bid to all persons who have a
known or recorded substantial property interest in the property and are subject
to an order other than an order under §
150.042(A)(2), (A)(3) or (A)(4).
      (3)   If action is being taken on the basis of an order that was served
by publication, it is sufficient to serve the statement that public bids are to
be let by publication, unless the Building Administrator has received
information in writing that enables the city to make notice by a method other
than publication.
   (E)   Notice of the statement that public bids are to be let must be given,
at least ten days before the date of the public bid, to all persons who have a
substantial property interest in the property and are subject to an order other
than an order under §
150.042(A)(2).
   (F)   If action is being taken under this section on the basis of an order
that was served by publication, it is sufficient to serve the statement that
public bids are to be let by publication, unless the enforcement authority has
received information in writing that enables it to make service under §
150.055 by a method other than publication.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has, in I.C. 36-1-4-11, granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (C)   In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the
purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP).
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

         (b)   Structures used by the public, such as a place of employment or
entertainment; and
         (c)   Development that does not meet the NFIP definition of a
structure for floodplain management purposes. Examples include, but are not
necessarily limited to, a gazebo, pavilion, picnic shelter or carport that is
open on all sides (roofed but not walled).
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing

such as soil, sand, gravel and stone.
   FLOOD or FLOODING.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; and
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD or FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOODPLAIN.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The BFE plus two feet at any given location in

   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or directly
by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the state in accordance with standard
engineering practices that are accepted by the State Department of Natural
Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods,
flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries and flood profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified and installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period, The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period, unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories.
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or of land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA. As shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA’s modification
of the SFFIA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support or basement entryway
immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. For floodplain management purposes, the lowest elevation
described among the following:

      (4)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars;
      (5)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters;
and
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 C.F.R. § 59.1), as long
as it meets the requirements of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which

people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: To protect people and structures; and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes, the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
NATURAL GRADE.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, any structure for
which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,

bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. (See REGULATORY FLOOD.)
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

CHANCE FLOOD and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook and the like.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Synonymous with “areas of special flood
hazard” and floodplain, lands within the jurisdiction of the city subject to a
1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance

on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the State Department of
Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

affected by multiple flood zones by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
   (B)   However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
§ 151.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or above
the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the floodplain
regulations will not be applied; provided, that the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.

which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (E)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall only be granted
when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence submitted
at the hearing for the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;

exceptional hardship as defined in §
151.05; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.40(A), (C)(1) or (D) may be granted.

Natural Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction in §§
151.40 through
151.44 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic
structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.

(Ord. 25-2022, passed 12-21-2022)
FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the State Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of
a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10)
may apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
151.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 I.A.C. 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the State Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the State
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
151.28(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   (a)   In floodway areas identified by the State Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.
         (b)   This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
   (B)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified on
the FIRM or identified by the State Department of Natural Resources through
detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.
   (C)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the State Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
State Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the State Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
subchapter have been met.
   (D)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
      (1)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the State Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the State Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper written
approval, evidence of general license qualification or floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the State
Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be issued,
provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from the State Department of Natural
Resources and the provisions contained in this subchapter have been met.

§ 152.022 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in
force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement
agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater
discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the city may seek a court order to access the
premises.

§ 152.023 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The city will establish requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of
the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at his, her or their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this subchapter. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.024 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.025 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release
of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or water of the
United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
   (B)   In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the city in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone
notice.
   (C)   If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.

§ 152.043 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The City MS4 Coordinator or another designated entity by the city,
hereinafter simply referred to as “the city,” shall administer, implement and
enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.044 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this subchapter does not intend, nor imply, that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will not be a violation of any
state or federal permits.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.045 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
located within the city. Release rate requirements, downstream restriction
considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property impact considerations,
policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion hazard corridors, and
compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the City Stormwater
Technical Standards.
   (B)   (1)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and
the associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a
watershed, it is the policy of the city to discourage direct release of runoff
from a new development or redevelopment without providing detention.
      (2)   However, in rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-
wide hydrologic study or watershed plan of a major stream (not a “beat the
peak” analysis) adopted by the city substantiates the benefits of (or allows
for) direct release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major
stream, the detention requirements set in this chapter may be waived.
      (3)   Other special circumstances when such a waiver may be considered by
the city include situations where the design of a regional pond has already
taken into account the provision of direct release in certain areas in the
watershed.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.046 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing and placement of
all stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards and
specifications outlined in the City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The methods and procedures in the City Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual are consistent with the policy stated above.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.047 DRAINAGE EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All stormwater systems, including detention or retention basins,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances, located outside of the right-
of-way shall be placed within a drainage easement. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected in any drainage easement,
unless otherwise accepted by the city. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the City Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. All drainage improvements performed relative to the
conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof, within
the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or homeowner
association.
   (B)   Any outlet to, crossing and/or encroachment of a county regulated
drainage easement requires application and acceptance from the County Drainage
Board in accordance with the State Drainage Code.

§ 152.071 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
   (A)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for example,
road extensions, sewer, water, off-site stockpiles and other utilities) to a
land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
   (B)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as roads, utilities or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance;
      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed; and
      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project sites,
such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of one acre
of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the
lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (C)   (1)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing and
placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in
the State Stormwater Quality Manual, the City Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer.
      (2)   The methods and procedures included in these two references are in
keeping with the above-stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM’s
CSGP. A copy of the State Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online
through IDEM.
   (D)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the city and commencement of construction activities,
the city has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan, the State Stormwater Quality Manual and the terms
and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the city, shall monitor and
manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding the
required monitoring activities are contained in the City Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
   (C)   (1)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a
guideline for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only
basis for implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site.
      (2)   The project site owner is responsible for implementing, in
accordance with this subchapter, all measures necessary to adequately prevent
polluted stormwater runoff. Recommendations by the trained individual for
modified stormwater quality measures should be implemented.
   (D)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements

§ 152.087 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements noted in §§
152.065 through
152.072, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the city as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also
include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
This includes both new development and re-development, and disturbances of land
less than one acre of total land area that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one acre
or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount of
disturbance, the city reserves the right to require pre-treatment BMPs for
proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in the
City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to construction
activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less
than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale; or individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 I.A.C. 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the State Department of Environmental Management under
329 I.A.C. 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the city in accordance with §§
152.105 and
152.119. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the city upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site,
requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the city. However, all
eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   Also exempt from the requirements of this subchapter shall be
agricultural land-disturbing activities associated with normal farming
operations.

§ 152.088 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The City MS4 Coordinator or another designated entity by the city,
hereinafter simply referred to as “the city,” shall administer, implement and
enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.089 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this subchapter does not intend, nor imply, that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will not be a violation of any
state or federal permits.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.090 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and redevelopment continues within the corporate boundaries of the
city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to treat the water quality
volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq), stormwater runoff will be
filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients and contaminants will be
removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
state streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the city, is
the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream channels
develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that they
receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of the city, measures must be taken to minimize the
impact of such development or re-development on streambank erosion. Through the
use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and
slowly release the channel protection volume (CPv), the volume and rate of
runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize
increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (C)   The project site owner must submit to the city a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-
approved list of BMPs specified in the City Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and maintenance manual
for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and a notarized
Maintenance Agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in the
City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the long-term
maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the deed for
the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP(s) must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other
than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the
burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the City Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMPs are provided in the City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under “hot spots” provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.

may, at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to other
entities deemed appropriate by the city. Additionally, a digital copy of the
construction plans is required in a format accepted by the city.
   (B)   After the city’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the city and/or its plan review consultant(s).
   (C)   Pursuant to I.C. 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD (if applicable) must make a preliminary determination as
to whether the construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially
complete before the end of the tenth working day (for sites with less than five
acres of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the
review authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with five acres or
larger of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to
the review authority. Note these time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.
   (D)   Once all comments from all reviewers have been received and review
completed, the city will either approve the project, request modifications or
deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with or accept the review
findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the city will place the project on the
agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Public Works and
Safety, provided the agenda for the meeting has not yet been advertised or
published. If time for notification does not allow, the project shall be placed
on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Public Works and
Safety. If the project must go through a scheduled meeting, the city will
furnish the applicant a complete list of comments and objections to the plans
and accompanying data prior to the scheduled meeting. After the scheduled
meeting, the city will either issue a permit, request modifications to the
construction plans, or deny the project.
   (E)   The project site owner must notify the city and IDEM before beginning
construction. Notification to the city shall be in the form of an email while
the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM NOI submittal.
Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction notifications
submitted to the city and IDEM before the beginning of construction,
construction may commence 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to IDEM. Once
construction starts, the project owner shall monitor construction activities
and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention measures in compliance with
this chapter and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. Upon
completion of construction activities, a certification of completion and
compliance and as-built plans must be submitted to the city.
   (F)   Once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a notification shall
be sent to the city, requesting a termination inspection. The city, or its
representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify that the
completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of chapter and
the city technical standards and that the terms and conditions of the permit.
Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination inspection
checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM along with
the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the city under this scenario will
expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is not completed
within five years, an updated permit application must be submitted to the city
and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at least 90 days prior to
expiration.

or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
      (2)   The city is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage
areas, the city may consider such factors as topography, soil type, capacity of
existing drains and distance from adequate drainage facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the city. Special terms and conditions for development
within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management
permit.
   (F)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The city is authorized, but is not required, to classify certain
geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be served by
regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an infrastructure
development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated drainage area.
The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development or re-
development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the City
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.

§ 152.118 CERTIFICATION OF AS-BUILT PLANS.
   (A) This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the city or retained
privately. After completion of construction of the project and before the
release of required performance assurances referenced in §
152.116, a professionally prepared and certified “as-built” set of plans
(record drawings) shall be submitted to the city for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the Engineer of Record
(i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans).
Additionally, a digital copy of the “as-built” plans (record drawings) as well
as finalized digital versions of all analyses, models, manuals and reports that
are consistent with the as-built conditions is required in a format acceptable
to the city.
   (B)   These plans shall include all pertinent data relevant to the completed
storm drainage system and stormwater management facilities, and shall include:
      (1)   Pipe size and pipe material;
      (2)   Invert elevations;
      (3)   Top rim elevations;
      (4)   Elevation of the emergency overflow (spillway) for ponds;
      (5)   Grades along the emergency flood routing path(s);
      (6)   Pipe structure lengths;
      (7)   BMP types, dimensions and boundaries/easements;
      (8)   “As-planted” plans for BMPs, as applicable;
      (9)   Data and calculations showing detention basin storage volume;
      (10)   Data and calculations showing BMP treatment capacity; and
      (11)   Certified statement on plans stating the completed storm drainage
system and stormwater management facilities substantially comply with
construction plans and the stormwater management permit as approved by the
city. (See certificate in the City Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.)
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.119 POST-PROJECT MAINTENANCE BOND AND VERIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to as-built plans and the certification of completion and
compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer or contractor shall be required to file a two-year maintenance
bond or other acceptable guarantee with the city in an amount not to exceed 25%
of the cost of the stormwater management system located outside the public road
rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to the city in order to assure that
such stormwater system installation was done according to standards of good
workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and installation were
of good quality and construction, and that such project was done in accordance
with the accepted plans, and this chapter and that any off-site drainage
problems that may arise, whether upstream or downstream of such project, will
be corrected if such drainage problems are determined by the city to have been
caused by the development of such project. The bond or other acceptable
guarantee shall be in effect for a period of two years after the date of the
release of required performance assurances referenced in §
152.116. The beneficiary of all maintenance bonds shall be the city.
   (B)   To verify that all stormwater infrastructure is functioning properly,
visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such infrastructure,
including all subsurface drains, shall be required twice, once following the
completion of installation of the stormwater management system and submittal of
as-builts, and the second time before release of maintenance bonds. These
visual recordings will be scheduled by the city and paid for by the developer.
Notices shall be provided to the city within 72 hours following the completion
of installation and again at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the
maintenance bond so that the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports
summarizing the results of the noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and
accepted by the city before the plat is recommended for recording and again
before the maintenance bond shall be recommended to be released.
   (C)   Additional requirements for transfer of any applicable stormwater BMP
Maintenance Agreement and the O&M Maintenance Manual to subsequent owners prior
to release of the maintenance bond is discussed in the City Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.

injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to and separate from the
imposition of any of the enforcement actions described below.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.132 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   This subchapter applies to any action or inaction which violates the
provisions of this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater
management design plan or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded
stormwater maintenance agreement.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.133 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
   The City MS4 Coordinator or another designated entity city, through the,
shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.134 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.

may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular
violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to
immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any
offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter
in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning
notice. Nothing in this subchapter shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.136 ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the city determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it may issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and
remedies authorized by this chapter, the city may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education and the like.
   (C)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed in §
152.999, if land disturbance activities are conducted contrary to the
provisions of this chapter or accepted final stormwater management plans, the
city may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any person
engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done, and any such persons
shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the city to proceed with the
work. A stop work order will be posted on the site by the city and it is
unlawful for any person to remove the notice or continue any work on the site
without permission from the city. The city may also undertake or cause to be
undertaken, any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent
violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance
herewith. The cost of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the property upon which the work is being done and the
responsibility of any person carrying out or participating in the work.
      (2)   The city may bring an action under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read
together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(l)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work
order against any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the city, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the erosion and
sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not adequate,
the project site owner must be notified in writing of the inadequacies in the
erosion and sediment control measures and the project site owner has 72 hours
after receiving written notice to resolve the identified inadequacies before
the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72-hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (D)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The city may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the city.
   (E)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The city may
suspend, revoke or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the city may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (F)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system; emergency
cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that
the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this
subchapter shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may commence court action
against such person under I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-
6-2-86(l)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
      (3)   The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
   (G)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge access
to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater drainage system or
waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (H)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises
terminated pursuant to this subchapter, without the prior approval of the city.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.137 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the city may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner shall
be required to promptly reimburse the city for all costs of such work.
   (B)   (1)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such
other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
      (2)   Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater
drainage system made necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties
levied by the EPA or IDEM for violation of the city’s NPDES permit,
administrative costs, attorney fees, court costs and other costs and expenses
associated with the enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and
monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the city may commence a court action to
recover the costs assessed under I.C. 34-28-54 (b), to be read together with
I.C. 34-6-2-86(l)(B) and I.C. 13-21-342(4).
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.138 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Board of Public Works
and Safety the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied.
Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the
appeal. The Board of Public Works and Safety shall consider the appeal and make
a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the action being appealed.
In considering any such appeal, the Board of Public Works and Safety may
consider the recommendations of the city staff and the comments of other
persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering any such appeal, the
Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a variance from the terms of this
chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the action being appealed,
but only upon finding that the following requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
the chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
      (3)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the Board of Public
Works and Safety may appeal an adverse decision of the Board of Public Works
and Safety to the county court within 60 days of the Board’s order, all
pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9(e) and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the Board of
Public Works and Safety upholding the decision of the city, then
representatives of the city shall enter upon the subject private property and
are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property, including the commencing of a court action under
I.C. 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with I.C. 34-6-2-86(l)(B) and I.C. 13-
21-3-12(4), to enforce the order of the Board of Public Works and Safety.
(Ord. 4-2024, passed 10-9-2024)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a civil
infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus costs,
damages and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues without a
compliance action that is satisfactory to the city may be deemed a separate
offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for
each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this subchapter are
cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An admission
or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this chapter
shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
   (C)   The city has established an Enforcement Response Schedule, as noted in
the table below that standardizes the approach that the city may, in its
discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses subject to
this chapter and the associated technical standards document. When so employed,
this Schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the following manner:
The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while the subsequent
second offenses through eighth offenses (as necessary) are failures of
compliance.
Offense Number Type of Response Anticipated
Offense Number  Type of Response Anticipated
First offense   Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning
                and administrative penalty
Second offense  Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Third offense   Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fourth offense  Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fifth offense   Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Sixth offense   Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Seventh offense Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Eighth offense  Litigation and administrative penalty
 
   (D)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the city may, in
its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties, the city
has established the following Schedule of Administrative Penalties. Again, the
penalty for the first offense would apply to the violation itself, while the
subsequent penalties for the second through fourth offenses (as necessary)
would apply to failures of compliance. In its discretion, the city may impose
penalties up to the amount specified in this Schedule.
 
Offense Number Penalty Amount
First offense  $250
Second offense $500
Third offense  $1,000
Fourth offense $2,500

      (2)   Medium: 20 to 40 feet; and
      (3)   Large: Over 40 feet.
   (B)   Another list will be maintained for acceptable trees to be planted in
areas where size is not necessarily a restriction. Lists of trees not suitable
for planting will also be created by the Tree Board.
(Prior Code, § 152.02) (Ord. 19-1997, passed 10-28-1997)
§ 153.03 SPACING OF STREET TREES.
   The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with the three size
classes listed in §
153.02, and no trees may be planted closer together than the following, except
in special plantings approved by the City Tree Board:
      (A)   Small trees: 30 feet;
      (B)   Medium trees: 40 feet; and
      (C)   Large trees: 50 feet.

153.99
§ 153.07 PUBLIC TREE CARE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The city shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and
remove trees, plants and shrubs within the rights-of-way of all streets,
alleys, avenues, lanes, parkways, highways, squares and public grounds, as may
be necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and
beauty of public grounds.
      (2)   This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees by
adjacent property owners providing that the selection and location of trees is
in accordance with §§
153.02 through
153.06 and with approval from the Tree Board as to species and location of the
tree. Whenever any tree is planted or set out in conflict with the provisions
of this chapter, it will be lawful for the City Street Commissioner to remove
or cause removal of the same. The cost of removal of a tree may be charged to
the property owner responsible for the planting thereof.
   (B)   (1)   The Tree Board may recommend to the Street Commissioner the
removal of any street tree or part thereof which is in unsafe condition or
which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas
lines, water lines or other public improvements, or is infected with any
injurious fungus, insect or other pest.
      (2)   Property owners wishing to do maintenance or removal work at their

$10 per square foot of pavement cut or $5 per square foot if outside of the
actual pavement; provided, however, that the performance security shall be in
an amount not less than $2,000. If applicant is using sub-contractors to
complete the work specified in the permit, all such sub-contractors must meet
the same security requirements as outlined herein.
      (3)   Said performance security shall be released only after the
completion of the work, inspection and approval by the City Planning and Zoning

permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the city’s cost
incurred in restoring the rights-of-way.

representative to place additional or revised conditions in the permit. Within
48 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall contact
the City Planning and Zoning Department or its authorized representative with a

reasonable costs, including restoration costs, the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys’ fees, if authorized by applicable law, incurred in
connection with such revocation.
