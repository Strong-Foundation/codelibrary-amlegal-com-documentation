§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
      All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “City
Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified Ordinances” or
“Code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation, shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or subsection.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

construed as imputing authority to a majority of such persons, unless otherwise

law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
such section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. Such section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture,
or liability.

payment thereof. Tenants and conditional-sale-contract purchasers may accept
the responsibility for payment thereof by lease or contract with the owner.
However, the city is not a party to such a lease or contract, and therefore,
the owner and tenant or conditional-sale-contract purchaser shall be jointly
and severally liable for payment to the city of any and all charges for the
city sewer system.

§ 51.36 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Workforce Manager has been refused access to a building, structure,
or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health safety and welfare of the
community, then the Workforce Manager may seek issuance of a search warrant
from the Adams Circuit Court or the Adams Superior Court of Adams County,
Indiana.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 51.45 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   (A)    When the Workforce Manager finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, a discharge permit, any provision of this chapter or
order issued hereunder, the Workforce Manager may serve upon that user a
written notice of violation setting forth the nature of the violation(s). The
notice may also include specific corrective actions and compliance schedules to
which the Workforce Manager requires the user to adhere. Within 30 days of the
receipt of this notice, the user shall submit to the Workforce Manager a
written explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, consistent with the terms of the notice (to include
specific corrective actions and compliance schedules).
   (B)   Compliance with the conditions, requirements and terms of this notice
shall not be construed to relieve the user of its obligation to comply with its
discharge permit, which remains in full force and effect, nor does such
compliance excuse violations occurring before or after receipt of this notice
of violation. Additional enforcement action may be pursued if corrective
actions are not accomplished as scheduled. The Workforce Manager expressly
reserves the right to seek any and all remedies available under any provision
of this chapter for any violations cited by the notice. Nothing in this chapter
shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.

§ 51.46 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
    When the Workforce Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate this chapter, discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, he or she may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge, directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not come into
compliance within the specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued to the user unless and until adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Such service shall not recommence until such time as the user is able to
demonstrate that it can and will maintain compliance. Failure to comply with
this compliance order may subject the user to having its connection to the
sanitary sewer sealed by the city and assessed the costs therefor. Compliance
orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably
necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not
limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring and improved management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.

      (5)   A statement indicating the exact time and place of the hearing, and
that the person to whom the show cause order was issued is entitled to appear
at the hearing with or without legal counsel, present evidence, cross examine
opposing witnesses and present arguments;
      (6)   A statement of the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
therefor;
      (7)   A statement indicating that a failure to comply with any of the
conditions, requirements or terms of the show cause order shall constitute a
violation of this code article, and may subject the user to such other
enforcement response that may be appropriate; and
      (8)   The name, address and telephone number of the Workforce Manager of
the city.
   (B)   The City Council may itself conduct a hearing and take the evidence,

mechanically. The person to whom the show cause order was issued, or any other
person with an interest in the proceedings, may appear in person or by counsel
at the hearing. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed,
enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate. Each person appearing at the
hearing is entitled to present evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses and
present arguments. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any
member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual
charges therefor.
   (D)   After the City Council has reviewed the evidence and if it finds any
violation(s) of this chapter, any prohibition, limitation or requirement
contained herein, or of the user’s discharge permit, or of any order issued
hereunder, it shall make findings and it may issue to the user responsible for
the discharge any orders or directives as are necessary and appropriate.

days, be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 12% per month. A lien against the
user’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (2)   No fines and/or penalties as set forth in this division (B) shall
be charged or otherwise enforced for charges retroactively incurred from March
1, 2020, until the date upon which the Governor of the State of Indiana lifts
the restriction set forth in Executive Order 20-05 prohibiting public utilities
from discontinuing service to customers in the state due to such services being
considered as essential services.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file a written request for
the Workforce Manager to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the
fine amount, within 30 days of being notified of the fine. The Workforce
Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Workforce Manager may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 51.50 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)    The Workforce Manager may immediately suspend a user’s discharge,
after formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the Workforce Manager, in order to halt or prevent an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an immediate or substantial
endangerment to human health, to the welfare of the public, or to the
environment, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or is
causing or will cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of the waste water treatment service
and/or the discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge.
In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Workforce Manager shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including, but not limited to, immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals or to the environment.
   (C)   The Workforce Manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period

DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 51.60 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of  preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence, that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Workforce
Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 51.61 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.15(A), or the specific prohibitions in §
51.15(B)(3) through (B)(7) and §
51.15(B)(9) through (B)(17), if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially,
in nature or constituents, from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

§ 51.62 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Workforce Manager, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Workforce Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Workforce Manager may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis, if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Workforce Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Workforce Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Workforce Manager has determined that
it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

§ 52.04 BASIS UPON WATER USE.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in a manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the
sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as
provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in determining
the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed,
but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that those quantities
do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building other than a
single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
city, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter,
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel or real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other
liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that an additional units charge shall be added
thereto, in the amount of $11.25 per month per dwelling unit over one served
through the single water meter. In the case of mobile home courts, the number
of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of
mobile home spaces available for rent plus any other dwelling units served
through a meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any
other space or spaces in which cooking facilities' are provided.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable
to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (F)   In order that the domestic and residential users of sewage service
shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of June, July,
August and September, the billing for sewage service for residences and/or
domestic users for the months of June, July, August and September shall be
based upon the average water usage billed for the previous billed months of
October, November and December. Averages resulting in fractions of 100 gallons
shall be raised to the next whole number of 100 gallons. In the event the water
usage for the previous billed months of June, July, August and September, then
the billing for sewage services shall be computed on the actual water used in
the month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or
residential sewage service as applicable to the sprinkling rate shall not apply
to each lot, parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a
residence. The sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are
partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a
portion of the premises shall be used for the privilege of separating the water
service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through a
separate meter and in such case the water usage as registered by the water
meter serving that portion of the premises used for residential purposes would
qualify under the sprinkling rate.

§ 52.05 BASIS UPON WASTEWATER CONSUMPTION.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The city shall
require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes
discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in
the manner, by the method and at times as the city may deem practicable in
light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the proper change. The user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the city at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 200 mg/l of fluid, suspended solids in excess of 200 mg/l of
fluid, or phosphorus in excess of 15 mg/l of fluid. Additional charges for
treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following
basis.
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.22 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 200 mg/l of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an additional charge
of $0.17 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
200 mg/l of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon phosphorus. There shall be an additional
charge of $3.02 per pound of phosphorus received in excess of 15 mg/l of fluid.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand and
phosphorus contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy
of Standard Methods for the Elimination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in accordance with
“Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants,” 40 CFR
part 136.
(Ord. 579, passed 5-27-08; Am. Ord. 653, passed 6-23-14)
§ 52.06 BILLING.
   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city in the
manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the portion of the total
billing charged for operation, maintenance and replacement for that user during
the preceding year, in conjunction with a regular billing.
   (B)   (1)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in
the event payment is not made as herein required.
      (2)   The owners or properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for
the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by the tenant or
tenants, provided that examination shall be made at the office at which the
records are kept and during the hours that the office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid by the 20th
day to the month following receipt are hereby declared to be delinquent and a
penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates and charges shall thereupon attach
thereto.
(Ord. 579, passed 5-27-08)
§ 52.07 BIENNIAL REVIEW.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain in
proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users of user
classes, the city shall cause a study to be made within a reasonable period of
time following the first two years of operation, following the date on which
this chapter goes into effect. The study shall include, but not be limited to,
an analysis of the cost associated with the treatment of excessive strength
effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics
attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial position of the
sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for
the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements and
capital improvements to the wastewater treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness, equity and proportionality
of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of
certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms
shall have experience in such studies, or by a combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city shall
determine to be best under the circumstances. The city shall, upon completion
of the study, revise and adjust the rates and charges as necessary, in
accordance therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency
of the rates.

(Ord. 745, passed 11-8-21; Am. Ord. 758, passed 11-28-22)
§ 53.11 DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Upon applying for water utility service from the city for a residence,
an applicant, whether an owner, tenant or contract purchaser, shall pay to the
Clerk-Treasurer a deposit in the sum of $200, which sum shall be utilized by
the city to ensure payment by the person occupying the property of the rates,
charges and fees assessed for the services rendered by the city water utility
with the respect to the property. Said $200 deposit may, upon request by the
customer, be paid in two equal installments, with the first installment of $100
being paid at the time of the filing of the application for service, and the
second installment of $100 being paid when invoiced in the first monthly
billing cycle not less than one month after the date of the initial deposit and
application. However, if an owner/landlord of a property occupied by a person
other than the owner requests that the city waive the deposit to be paid by the
person occupying said property, and in lieu of such deposit, the owner/landlord
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the city for any unpaid utility invoices
remaining after the occupier of said property vacates such property, and said
owner/landlord further executes an approved utility indemnification agreement
setting forth such indemnification, then the city will waive the deposit
otherwise required herein. Furthermore, if the applicant for water utility
service is a customer for a previous residence within the city, and said
customer has had no late water utility payments during the immediately previous
36 months prior to application for new water utility service at a different
residential location, then no additional deposit shall be required for said
applicant.
   (B)   The city shall maintain a record of each applicant or customer making
a deposit that includes the following:
      (1)   The name of the customer.
      (2)   The current address of the customer so long as said customer
maintains an active account with the utility in his or her name.
      (3)   The name of the owner or manager of the property.
      (4)   The current address of the property.
      (5)   The amount of deposit.
      (6)   The date the deposit was made.
      (7)   A record of each transaction affecting said deposit.
   (C)   Each customer shall be provided with a receipt from the city at the
time the deposit is paid. The city shall provide a reasonable method by which a
customer who is unable to locate the receipt may establish that he or she is
entitled to a refund of said deposit.
   (D)   If a customer pays the deposit by check and the check is returned for
insufficient funds, then the customer shall be assessed the returned check fee
set forth under I.C. 35-43-5-5 or any subsequent statute which addresses
returned check fees.
   (E)   Any deposit will be refunded promptly upon successful termination of
utility services between the customer and the city. The procedure following a
customer request for termination of service is as follows:
      (1)   The city shall require payment of any past due balance currently
invoiced and owed for said water utility.
      (2)   The city may apply or otherwise credit all or part of said deposit
to the final invoicing for unpaid rates, charges and fees assessed to the water
utility customer. The use of all or part of said deposit toward said unpaid
rates, charges and fees shall not prohibit the city from taking further actions
under §§
53.13 through
53.15 herein.
      (3)   Any portion of the deposit remaining after the credit set forth in
division (E)(2) above shall be forwarded to the customer. Water utility
deposits shall only be released to a third party upon written agreement between
the owner of the deposit and the third party being presented to the city.
   (F)   Upon written request by a customer who has previously paid the deposit
as set forth herein, and who has had no late water utility payments during the
immediately previous 36 months prior to said written request, the city shall
refund said deposit to said customer, said refund to be paid within 30 days of
said written request.
   (G)   Unclaimed deposits. Any deposit made by the applicant, customer or any
other person to the city for the water utility (less any lawful deductions
therefrom), or any sum the city is ordered to refund for utility service that
has remained unclaimed for seven years after the utility has made diligent
effort to locate the person who made such deposit, shall be presumed abandoned
and shall be transferred to the office of the Indiana Attorney General pursuant
to I.C. 32-34-1.

§ 53.13 NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS CHARGES AND PROCEDURES.
   If a check for payment on an account is returned for non-sufficient funds or
an automated clearing house (ACH) payment on an account is reversed for non-
sufficient funds, the city will charge an additional $20 NSF fee to that
account. The city shall post a notice upon the property of the account that the
bill shall be paid in full with the NSF fee within three days of the posting of
said notice, and if the account is not so paid, the city shall disconnect
service to said property. If an account paid by ACH has two or more NSF

   (E)   Water service disconnection. The city shall send a disconnect notice
along with the monthly bill that is sent in the month following the delinquency

city shall disconnect water service or otherwise turn off such service without
further notice. However, if the 10th day of the month following the delinquent
date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, then the city shall
disconnect water service or otherwise turn off such service without further
notice after 4:31 p.m. on the first business day after such weekend or holiday.
All water service subject to disconnection shall be disconnected by the city
utility personnel. Any customer water service that is disconnected for non-
payment can only be reconnected after full payment is received plus the
reconnection fee as set forth in §
53.15.
   (F)   Clerk-Treasurer as Hearing Officer on application for extension on
disconnection of service. A person owing an unpaid water bill may appeal in

barking.

   (A)   Complaint. Unless a violation under this chapter is determined
unilaterally by the city, a citizen who believes that there is a violation
under this chapter shall file with the Clerk-Treasurer a formal complaint of a
violation. The complaint shall be in writing, upon a complaint form approved by
the city, and signed by the complainant. The complaint shall include the name
and contact information of the complainant, the property upon which there is
believed to be a violation, a detailed description of the condition of the
property believed to be in violation, a detailed proposed remedy of the
situation, and any additional information and exhibits (such as pictures and
the like) that may assist in a determination.
   (B)   Inspection of premises. When a complaint is made to the Clerk-
Treasurer that a public nuisance exists or has existed within the city, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall promptly notify the Building and Planning Director, who,
along with the Chief of Police and the Workforce Manager, shall forthwith
inspect or cause to be inspected the premises, and shall make a written report
of their findings. Whenever practicable, the inspection officers shall cause
photographs to be made of the premises and shall file the same in the office of
the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (C)   Nuisance Review Board. A Nuisance Review Board, composed of the Mayor,
Building and Planning Director, Chief of Police, Workforce Manager, and City
Attorney, shall examine the report of the inspection officers. If the Nuisance
Review Board determines that there is no violation, a letter of that
determination shall be sent to the complainant. If the Nuisance Review Board
determines that there may be a violation, a copy of the complaint shall then be
sent by the Clerk-Treasurer to the property owner. The Committee may attempt to
meet with the property owner in order to discuss the situation and attempt to
arrive at a resolution thereof. If the Nuisance Review Board shall determine
that a public nuisance exists on private property, and that there is a great
and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency,
the Nuisance Review Board may direct the Chief of Police, or a police deputy,
to serve a notice on the owner, or, if the owner cannot be found, on the
occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining such nuisance, and to
post a copy of the notice on the premises. The notice shall direct the owner,
occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance to abate or
remove it within 48 hours, and shall state that unless the nuisance is so
abated, the city will cause the same to be abated and will charge the cost
thereof to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the
same, as the case may be. If the Nuisance Review Board shall determine that a
public nuisance may exist on private property, and that there is not a great
and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency,
then the Nuisance Review Board shall refer the issue to the Board of Public
Works and Safety with a recommendation of proper action to be taken by the
City.
   (D)   Board of Public Works and Safety. If the Nuisance Review Board has
referred a matter to the Board of Public Works and Safety, the Board shall meet
at either a regular or special meeting in order to discuss the matter and to
take action thereon. The Board may invite the property owner and/or the
complainant to the meeting in which the Board deliberates thereon. If the Board
shall determine that a public nuisance exists on private property, and that
there is a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace,
morals or decency that a public nuisance exists on private property, then the
Board shall give notice of the violation to be served the owner or the occupant
or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or by posting a copy of the notice on the premises.
The notice shall direct the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining the nuisance to abate or remove it within a period of time
designated by the Board, and shall state that unless the nuisance is so abated,
the city will cause the same to be abated and will charge the cost thereof to
the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the same, as
the case may be.
   (E)   Abatement by city. If the nuisance is not abated within the time
provided or if the owner, occupant or person causing the nuisance cannot be
found, the Building and Planning Director and the Workforce Manager shall cause
the abatement or removal of such public nuisance.
   (F)   Abatement by court action. If the Board of Public Works and Safety
shall determine that a public nuisance exists on private premises, but that the
nature of the nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to
the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, and if the Board is unable
to arrive at an agreement with the violating party in order to voluntarily
abate the violation, then the Board shall cause an action to abate the nuisance
to be commenced in the name of the city. The City Attorney may initiate an
action to abate or enjoin such nuisances.

cost of abating a public nuisance by the city shall be collected as a debt from
the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance.
The cost of the abatement shall include, but not be limited to, court costs,
attorney's fees and interest on any amounts incurred by the city. If the city
uses municipal employees, it shall set and assign an appropriate per-hour rate
for employees, equipment, supplies and chemicals that may be used. The Clerk-
Treasurer shall send a notice to the owner of the cost of abatement, and the
owner shall then have 30 days from the mailing of the notice to reimburse the
city. If the cost of abatement is not reimbursed within 60 days of the mailing
of the notice, the Clerk-Treasurer shall file a certified copy of the statement
of costs in the Auditor's office of Adams County, and the Auditor shall place
the amount so claimed on the tax duplicate against the lands of the landowner
affected by the lien, and the same shall be collected as taxes disbursed to the

§ 115.01 PURPOSE.
   These rules and regulations are designed to control and restrict garage
sales in order to protect the public health, safety and convenience and to
restrict such sales to casual and/or occasional occurrences only, in keeping
with the character of the neighborhood where this activity is carried on in
compliance with
Chapter 152, Zoning, of Title XV of the Berne City Code. The intent of this
chapter is to eliminate perpetual, prolonged and extended garage sales in
residential areas. Such sales, if continued indefinitely, tend to become retail
businesses in residential areas and zones, create a nuisance, and often violate
the zoning regulations of the city. The provisions of this chapter arise from
the need to limit, regulate, restrict and control garage sales. It is not the
intent of this chapter to change or amend
Chapter 152, Zoning, of Title XV, and/or any other ordinances of the city.

arterial thoroughfares and primary and secondary streets are designated on the
thoroughfare map (Plate 7) of the Master Plan for the city. For the purpose of
this chapter, streets shall be classified as follows:
      ARTERIAL THOROUGHFARES. These facilities serve to move traffic on Indiana
and U.S. marked routes. Where a highway is a non-limited access route, these
facilities also perform a secondary function of providing direct access to
abutting land and thus interconnect principal traffic generators.
      LOCAL OR RESIDENTIAL STREETS. The sole function of these streets is to
provide access to the immediately adjacent property. Local access streets are
intended to carry low volumes of traffic.
      MARGINAL ACCESS STREET. A street designated to connect not more than two
streets and which normally parallels an arterial thoroughfare, or a primary or
secondary street, and is not separated from the thoroughfare or street by a lot
or a tier of lots, and which is specifically so designated and approved on the
plat of the subdivision.
      PRIMARY OR MAJOR ROUTES. These facilities serve to connect cities with
each other as well as to link smaller towns or settlements with the arterial
thoroughfares system. Primary routes provide access to abutting land and
generally serve all principal traffic generators.
      SECONDARY OR CONNECTOR ROADS. These facilities serve intra-city movements
of traffic, such as that moving between a subdivision and major street. The
principal difference between the connector road and streets or roads of higher
classification is the length of trip each principally serves. They are intended
to supply the abutting property with the same degree of land service as the
local street, while at the same time serving larger volumes of traffic.
   SUBDIVIDER or DEVELOPER. Any person or his agent engaged in developing or
improving a tract of land which complies with the definition of a subdivision
as defined in this chapter.
   SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel of land. All subdivisions shall
be classified as exempt subdivisions, minor subdivisions or major subdivisions.
There shall be no further division of a subdivision (includes a split-off from
a root parcel) except as provided below.
      EXEMPT SUBDIVISION.
         (a)   The division of a root parcel into not more than three parcels.
This will allow two splits of a root parcel.
         (b)   A court-ordered partition of land.
         (c)   The division of land by testamentary or intestate succession.
(This exemption does not include the division of land by estate personal
representatives or by requested court orders where the court order is not
merely fulfilling the terms of a testamentary or intestate transfer.
         (d)   The sale or exchange of parcels or parts thereof between
adjoining lot owners where the sale or exchange does not create additional
building sites, such as where adjoining landowners exchange land in order to
correct or straighten property lines.
         (e)   The division of land for purely agricultural purposes, not
involving any new public ways or easements, and not reasonably expected to
result in new building sites, whether presently or in the future, and includes
20 acres of land per parcel.
         (f)   The sale or exchange of a parcel of land by contract, if the
contract was executed prior to June 1, 1998.
      MAJOR SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel into more than five
parcels.
      MINOR SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel into five or fewer
parcels.
   YARD. A space on the same lot with a building, which is open, unoccupied,
and unobstructed by structures, except as provided in Chapter 152.
   ZONING ADMINISTRATOR. The officer designated and authorized by the
Commission to enforce the zoning requirements.
   ZONING CHAPTER. The part of the Master Plan, now or hereafter adopted, which
includes an article and map which divides the area within the city and the
unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission into
districts, with regulations and requirements and procedures for the
establishment of land use controls.
(Ord. 466, § 4-4-1, passed 5-11-98)
PRIMARY PLAT
§ 151.025 PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS.
   In order to make the most of opportunities related to the subdivision and to
conserve time, effort, and expense, the owner or subdivider shall submit to the
Plat Officer at an informal conference, a sketch plan of the proposed

vary density shall, however, be subject to the following conditions:
   (A)   An overall plan of the entire tract showing roads, lot lines, lot
areas, easements, encumbrances, and other relevant data shall be submitted in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Overall density shall not exceed that of the zoning district in which

the deeds of all property within the development a clause, giving to the owners
an interest in the open land which shall be used for recreational purposes
only. (No structure except those incidental to the recreational use shall be
permitted thereon.)
   (E)   Open land shall be a minimum of 1½ acres (and shall be subject to
taxation). In the case of open tracts of three or more acres, the developer may

the purpose of this chapter, streets shall be classified as follows:
      ARTERIAL THOROUGHFARE. This type of facility serves plainly to move
through traffic. Indiana and U.S. marked routes are considered under this
classification. Where a highway is a non-limited access route, these facilities
also perform a secondary function of providing direct access to abutting land
and thus interconnect principal traffic generators.
      PRIMARY OR MAJOR ROUTES. These facilities connect cities with each other
as wall as to link smaller to towns or settlements with the arterial
thoroughfare system. Primary routes provide access to abutting land and
generally serve all principal traffic generators.
      SECONDARY OR CONNECTOR ROADS. These facilities serve intra-city movements
of traffic, such as that moving between a subdivision and major street. The
principal difference between the connector road and streets or roads or higher
classification is the length of trip each principally serves. They are intended
to supply the abutting property with the same degree of land service as the
local street, while at the same time serving larger volumes of traffic.
      LOCAL OR RESIDENTIAL SHEETS. The sole function of these streets is to
provide access to the immediately adjacent property. Local access streets are
intended to carry low volumes of traffic.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed, erected or placed which requires location
on or in the ground, or attached to something having a location on or in the
ground. Devices used for the support of wires or appurtenances supplying public
utility services shall not be considered as structures under this chapter. A
home satellite dish for television reception shall be considered a structure.
Oil wells, derricks and related equipment including storage tanks shall be
considered as structures. A transmission line and its towers and associated
structures shall be permitted by the obtaining of one permit for the entire
construction project in the city. If not enforceable due to conflicts with
eminent domain, a map showing the location of lines and towers and other needed
information shall be requested.
   SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel of land. All subdivisions shall
be classified as exempt subdivisions, minor subdivisions, or major
subdivisions. There shall be no further division of a subdivision (includes a
split-off from a root parcel) unless the further division is exempt as provided
below.
      EXEMPT SUBDIVISION.
         (a)   The division of a root parcel into not more than three parcels.
This will allow two splits of a root parcel.
         (b)   A court ordered partition of land.
         (c)   The division of land by testamentary or intestate succession.
This exemption does not include the division of land by estate personal
representatives or by requested court orders where the court order is not
merely fulfilling the terms of a testamentary or intestate transfer.
         (d)   The sale or exchange of parcels or parts thereof, between
adjoining lot owners where the sale or exchange does not create additional
building sites, such as where adjoining landowners exchange land in order to
correct or straighten property lines.
         (e)   The division of land for purely agricultural purposes, not
involving any new public ways or easements, and not reasonably expected to
result in new building sites whether presently or in the future, and includes
20 acres of land per parcel.
         (f)   The sale or exchange of a parcel of land by contract, if the
contract was executed prior to January 1, 1998.
      MAJOR SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel into more than five
parcels.
      MINOR SUBDIVISION. The division of a root parcel into five or fewer
parcels.
   TOURIST HOME. A building in which one but not more than five guest rooms are
used to provide or offer overnight accommodations for transient guests, also
known as bed and breakfast inns.
   TRADE OR BUSINESS SCHOOL. Secretarial school or college, business school or
college when not public and not owned or conducted by or under the sponsorship
of a religious or charitable organization, school conducted as commercial
enterprise for teaching instrumental music, dancing. barbering, martial arts,
hair dressing, or for teaching industrial skills in which machinery is employed
as a means of instruction. This definition shall not be deemed to include
educational institutions as defined in this section.
   USE. The employment or occupancy of a building, structure or land for a
person's service, benefit or enjoyment.
      USE, CONTINGENT. A use that is essential or desirable to the public
convenience or welfare but is not necessarily a permitted use.
      USE, PERMITTED. A use that is allowed, as a right, within a certain zone.
      USE, SPECIAL. A use that is desired in a certain zone and is not a
permitted use that will not be detrimental to the surrounding area.
   VARIANCE. A modification of the strict terms of the relevant regulations of
this chapter where the modification will not be contrary to the public
interest, and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the
result of the action of the applicant, a literal enforcement of this chapter
would result in unnecessary and undue hardship.
   YARD. A space on the same lot with a main building, open, unoccupied and
unobstructed by buildings or structures from the ground to the sky, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter.
      YARD, FRONT. A yard extending across the full width of the lot, the depth
of which shall be the least distance between the front lot line and the front
of the main building.

buildings and land, and open space about buildings as established by this
chapter.

established by this chapter or by amendments that may later be adopted, there
exist nonconforming structures, nonconforming uses of land, and nonconforming
uses of structures or of structures and land in combination, which were lawful
before this section was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this section or future amendments
hereto. It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconforming uses to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is
further the intent of this section that nonconforming uses shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor that they be used as grounds for
adding other structures or uses which are prohibited elsewhere in the same
zone. Illegal uses existing at the time this chapter is enacted shall not be
validated by virtue of its enactment. (`84 Code, Article 2, Chapter 3, Intro.)
   (B)   Continuation of nonconforming structures.  
      (1)   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter that could not now be built under the terms of

its location on the lot, bulk or other requirements contending the structure,
the structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
      (2)   A nonconforming structure may be repaired or altered, provided no
structural change shall be made.
      (3)   A structure, nonconforming as to height, yard or lot area
requirements, shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the
structure, including any addition or enlargement, is made to conform to the
height, yard or lot area requirements of the zone in which it is located.
      (4)   No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other location on the lot unless every portion of each structure is made to
conform to all the regulations of the zone in which it is located.
(Ord. 466, § 2-3-1, passed 5-11-98)
   (C)   Continuation of nonconforming uses of land.

land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this
chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (2)   No nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by those uses at the

this chapter that would not now be allowed in the zone in which it is located
under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a structure, designed for a conforming use,
shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of the conforming
structure, nor changed except to a conforming use.

a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the zone, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.

combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. 466, § 2-3-3, passed 5-11-98)

or as a special exemption, shall be regarded as a conforming use and may be
continued except that any change in layout, expansion or extension shall be

this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done; provided, however,
that no action shall be taken or decision made except after public hearing.

require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
or development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and upon which actual
building construction has carried on diligently. Where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun and/or preparatory to
rebuilding, the demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that the work shall be carried on diligently. ACTUAL

restoration will cost more than double its assessed valuation, shall be
repaired or rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this chapter.

specified for amortization of nonconforming uses shall be measured from the
date of any reclassification or change. (Ord. 466, § 2-3-7, passed 5-11-98)

§ 152.110 RECREATIONAL SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General recreational space requirements. A recreational space
requirement is required for all R-1 and R-2 zones and any agricultural or other
zone where residential housing is being planned or proposed. (Ord. 466, § 2-
11.5-1, passed 5-11-98)
   (B)   Criteria for guidance. In a Commission- approved development plan, and
in the approval of subdivisions requiring recreational space, the Commission-
approved recreation space shall be approved in all zones as defined in division
(E) of this section. The purpose of providing this space shall be to meet the
immediate and future recreational needs of the developments residence and a
neighborhood setting. Recreation space may be provided in a centrally located
site, in distinctly separate sites, as connecting links between separated
activity areas, or adjacent to other existing or proposed recreation spaces.
The Commission shall determine if the proposed recreation space is suitable for
the intended use. Consideration shall be given to the location of the proposed
recreation space, and it shall be reasonably close to and adjacent to
residential areas or centrally located between phased developments. Wasteland
or land undesirable for development shall not be substituted for recreational
space unless its location and suitability is consistent with recreational use.
(Ord. 466, § 2-11.5-2, passed 5-11-98)
   (C)   Covenants. All developments with recreational space must contain
acceptable covenants which, in the opinion of the Commission, insure adequate
maintenance of those recreation spaces. (Ord. 466, § 2-11.5-3, passed 5-11-98)
   (D)   Amount of recreational space required. Recreational space shall be
required when, in the opinion of the Commission, it would be desirable for the
proposed development considering the surrounding area and the density of
families benefitting from open space and recreational uses. Therefore, a
recreational space requirement may be required by the Commission for minor
subdivisions if, in the opinion of the Commission, all the above criteria are
present and it would be desirable for the proposed development and surrounding
area to have recreational space included as part of the plan. Unless
extenuating circumstances exist, recreational space will generally not be
required in case of minor subdivisions. (Ord. 466, § 2-11.5-4, passed 5-11-98)
   (E)   Recreational space and major subdivisions.
Recreational space shall be required in all major subdivisions of more than ten
lots and may be required in major subdivisions of ten or fewer lots if, in the
opinion of the commission, it is determined that the recreational space is
desirable and necessary to the orderly development of the area. In major
subdivisions of over ten lots the minimum amount of recreational space which
shall be required shall be a minimum of 10% of the total area developed with a
minimum of 32,670 square feet. (Ord. 466, § 2-11.5-5, passed 5-11-98)
   (F)   Physical improvements. The term RECREATIONAL SPACE shall be
interpreted to mean void of non-recreational structures, street rights-of-way,
open parking areas and driveways for dwellings. The space qualified for
recreational space shall be made reasonably level and suitable for organized or
unorganized play and recreation by children and adults. The developer may but
is not required to provide specific playground equipment and physical
improvements. (Ord. 466, § 2-11.5-6, passed 5-11-98)
   (G)   Use of recreational space. Space intended for limited recreational
activity or other uses, such as golf courses, to which all residents of the
development may not be permitted free access because of the payment of a fee or
charge, shall not qualify in meeting the recreational space requirement herein.

a zone wherein a development plan is required, the following matters shall be
accomplished:
      (1)   The Commission shall have granted primary and secondary approval of
the development plan in accordance with this subchapter and the Comprehensive
Master Plan.
      (2)   The applicant shall have duly recorded in the office of the County
Recorder the utility easements, rights-of-way, plats, deed restrictions, or any
other legal instruments required, and in the form approved by the Commission.
   (B)   The requirement for approval of a development plan, prior to the
issuance of improvement location permit, shall also specifically apply to any
residential condominium development which is subject to the requirements of
I.C. 32-1-6, the Indiana Horizontal Property Act, as the same may be amended
from time to time, regardless of whether zoning district in which the subject
real estate is located required approval of development plan for the intended
use under this chapter. A condominium development shall be subject to all
requirements set forth in § 152.125.
(Ord. 466, § 2-13-8, passed 5-11-98)
§ 152.128 AMENDMENTS TO APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (A)   General requirements. After the Commission has granted either primary
or secondary approval of a development plan, any amendments thereto shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Zoning Administrator by way of an amended
application for the type of approval sought, on a form prescribed by the
Commission. Any application shall also be accompanied by the pertinent
submissions required under this chapter for the proposed amendments involved,
together with the requisite filing fee if a public hearing is required
hereunder to be held upon the amended application.
   (B)   Execution of amended application. Any application submitted for
amendment of a development plan following the granting by the Commission of
primary approval, but prior to the granting of secondary approval, need contain
only the signature(s) of the original applicant(s), or the successor(s) in
interest thereto. After secondary approval of a development plan has been
granted, any applications for proposed amendments thereto shall contain the
signatures of all owners of record, as shown in the Real Estate Master File
maintained by the County Auditor at the time the application is filed, of the
real estate included in that portion of the development plan for which
secondary approval had previously been granted and for which amendment is being
sought.
   (C)   Requirement for public hearing. If, in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator, the amendment to the development plan proposed in the
application is substantial, in terms of the scope of the overall project and/or
the possible impact upon the community and land uses, both existing and
planned, which surround the area included in the development plan, then the
Zoning Administrator may either require the matter to be heard by the
Commission at a public hearing, or defer the decision to the Plan Commission
for a determination of a public hearing. In the event the determination is to
be made by the Plan Commission, notice of the date and time of the meeting of
the Commission at which the determination is to be made shall be given by the
Zoning Administrator to the applicant. No other notice need be given, except as
required by law. Any action by the Commission in determining whether a public
hearing must be held before the Commission upon the amendments proposed by the
applicant shall be a final decision, which may not be appealed to the
Commission except by a dissenting Commission member as provided by rule.
   (D)   Commission action. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing
in this section shall preclude the Commission from requiring, as a condition
for the granting of primary approval of an overall development plan, that
subsequent public hearings be conducted before the Commission, as to any
portions of the overall development plan or any later amendments, alterations
or modifications proposed with regard thereto. The Commission may, however,
waive any procedural or submission requirements otherwise provided under this
chapter, which it may deem necessary when reviewing a change to an approved
development plan.
   (E)   Conduct of subsequent public hearing. If the Commission requests, or
is required under the provisions of this chapter, to conduct a second or
subsequent public hearing for approval of a development plan or an amendment
thereto, then the hearing shall be conducted and notice furnished in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter and the pertinent rules duly adopted by the
Commissions.

§ 152.129 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following minimum design standards shall apply to all site improvements
on real estate for which a development plan is required. Individual zoning
districts may also supplement the following standards with more detailed
standards pertinent to individual districts.
   (A)   Environmental design.
      (1)   It is the intention of the Plan Commission to encourage the
preservation of natural site amenities and to minimize the disturbance to the
natural environment.
      (2)   Existing trees and other natural features shall be preserved
whenever possible. The location of these features must be considered when
planning common open space, location of buildings, underground services, walks,
paved areas, and finished grade levels. The Commission may inquire into the
means whereby natural features will be protected during construction.
   (B)   Building separation. In reviewing the location of all structures
within the development plan boundaries, the Commission shall determine that the
structures are located so as to allow adequate light, air, ease of entry and
access by emergency vehicles. For those districts without specified yard
requirements, the Commission shall be guided by the following:
      (1)   That the open areas provided around the building be sufficient to
provide occupants of the structure with adequate light and air from all outside
walls which contain windows or doors.
      (2)   That sufficient space is provided for access and entry to buildings
from all streets, parking lots and other buildings.
      (3)   That in the event lots for one-family or two-family dwellings are
to be sold prior to construction and the applicant cannot indicate structures
on the development plan, those structures shall be subject to the yard
provisions of the zoning and subdivision ordinances for the R-1, R-2, and R-
3 districts or other Commission-approved minimums, unless specifically waived.
   (C)   Vehicular circulation facilities. All present and future dedicated
right-of-way widths and street improvements shall meet the requirements of the
subdivision control ordinance as now or hereafter amended.
   (D)   Pedestrian circulation facilities. Pedestrian walkways shall be
constructed in a location and to specifications approved by the Commission.
These walkways shall provide for pedestrian circulation throughout the
development and shall be separated from vehicular traffic. Where distance
separation cannot be achieved, physical separation may be required in cases
which the Commission deems it necessary.
   (E)   Sanitary sewage disposal and water supply systems. All water supply
and sanitary sewage disposal systems, whether private or public in nature,
shall be subject to compliance with local, and where appropriate, state agency
requirements. Plans must be submitted to and approved by the appropriate
agencies.
   (F)   Storm drainage.
      (1)   Adequate surface and subsurface drainage ways for the removal of
storm water shall be provided by the developer. The extent to which storm
drainage facilities shall be required shall be based upon an analysis of need
prepared for the developer by a registered professional engineer and/or
registered land surveyor. The computations shall show that the peak runoff rate
after development for the 100-year return period storm of 24-hour duration
shall not exceed the 10-year return period pre-development peak runoff rate.
Times of concentration, soil infiltration rates, and other variable actors to
be used in the analysis shall be discussed with and approved by the County
Surveyor during the preliminary consideration of the subdivision. The engineer
(or his agent) preparing the analysis shall provide the County Surveyor with a
copy of the computations used in the completion of the analysis.
      (2)   A storm water sewer system, which shall be separate and independent
of the sanitary sewer system, with surface inlets, shall be provided by the
developer in all cases where curb and gutter is to be installed and whenever
the available evidence indicates that such a system is necessary due to the
inadequacy of the natural surface drainage.
      (3)   Any person proposing to locate a structure or a use within 100 feet
of any stream or main drainage channel in any zoning district shall include
with the application for an improvement location permit and/or a certificate of
occupancy, a statement from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management,
based on a study of the watershed area and the probable runoff, that the
structure or use in the proposed location will leave adequate space for the
flow of flood water, provided, however, that no building shall be permitted
within 75 feet of the top of the bank of any stream or main drainage channel
unless permitted by the County Drainage Board.
      (4)   The developer shall furnish the Commission a complete set of plans
and profiles as approved by the various authorities.
      (5)   All plans and workmanship shall be in compliance with the Indiana
Drainage Code, I.C. 36-9-27 and all acts supplemental and amendatory to it.
   (G)   Recreation space requirements.
      (1)   Recreational space requirements and the criteria for approval in
the development plan and/or platting of applicable subdivisions are contained
in § 152.110. The following standards are to be utilized in the evaluation of
all required recreation space in a Commission-approved development plan:
         (a)   Commission-approved recreation space shall be provided in all
residential zones as defined in § 152.121. The purpose of providing this space
shall be to meet the immediate and future recreational needs of the
development's residents in a neighborhood setting. Recreation space may be
provided in a centrally located site, in distinctly separated sites, as
connecting links between separated activity areas, or adjacent to other
existing or proposed recreation spaces. The Commission shall determine if the
proposed recreation space is suitable for the intended use. This requirement
may be waived when, in the opinion of the Commission, the applicant has
satisfactorily demonstrated that he has provided alternative methods for
meeting the recreational needs of his development's residents.
         (b)   All developments with recreation space must contain acceptable
covenants which, in the opinion of the Commission, insure adequate maintenance
of those recreation spaces.
      (2)   Physical improvements. The term recreation space shall be
interpreted to mean void of non-recreational structures, street rights-of-way,
open parking areas and driveways for dwellings.
      (3)   Use of recreation space. Space intended for limited recreational or
other uses, such as a golf course, to which all residents of the development
may not be permitted free access because of the payment of a fee or a charge,
shall have a maximum of three-fourths of the space utilized in meeting the
recreation space requirements of the total development.
   (H)   Paving. All access drives and off-street parking facilities shall
either be paved with concrete or with other approved surfacing material to
adequately provide a durable and dust-free surface.
   (I)   Parking standards.
      (1)   Parking areas may be required to be arranged so as to prevent
through traffic to other parking areas.
      (2)   Parking areas shall be screened from adjacent non-related
structures, roads and traffic arteries with plantings, earth berms, walls or
changes in grade, when deemed necessary by the Commission.
      (3)   All parking areas shall be marked so as to provide for orderly and
safe parking, storage and movement.
      (4)   When it is in the interest of safety and better vehicle and
pedestrian circulation, the Plan Commission may require the use of landscape
elements to provide physical separation of use areas.
      (5)   All parking areas shall be adequately lighted. All lighting shall
be so arranged as to direct the light away from adjoining real estate.
      (6)   All parking areas and off-street loading areas shall be graded and
drained to remove all surface water without erosion and flooding.
   (J)   Street lighting. Street lighting shall be provided in all residential
developments. Alternative street lighting proposals will be considered by the
Commission if found to be appropriate in scale and intensity. Where pedestrian
facilities are separated from streets to the extent that they are not
adequately lighted from the street light facilities, separate lighting
facilities shall be provided on pedestrian facilities.

first class condition. Roads in any mobile home park shall not be accepted into
the city street system and the operator shall provide for their maintenance.
      (6)   All R-3 Mobile Home Park zones shall have open space, unless waived
by the Commission, at a rate of 200 square feet per mobile home lot. The
Commission may require recreational space the same as set out in § 152.110.
      (7)   In addition to the parking regulations in § 152.090(B), the mobile
home park developer shall provide two parking areas per each lot.
      (8)   Sidewalks of 36-inch minimum width shall be provided by the
developer; the sidewalks shall serve each lot and mobile home.
      (9)   Street lighting shall be provided by the developer. The light value
on all occupied streets shall be a minimum of 0.1 foot candle.
      (10) Water supply shall be from a municipal water service or from
approved and protected driven wells that meet all test requirements, provided
with tight, elevated concrete platforms, and which will not be subject to
overflow or surface drainage. The source and supply of the water for human
consumption must meet all the requirements of the County and State Boards of
Health. The use of open wells, springs, cisterns, or open storage tanks for
human consumption is unlawful and shall constitute a violation of the terms of
this chapter.
      (11) (a)   Mobile home parks must be kept in clean and sanitary condition
and provided with suitable covered metal receptacles for garbage, waste, litter
and trash. Receptacles must be emptied once a week, and the contents of same

(Ord. 466, § 2-16.5-2, passed 5-11-98)
§ 152.147 LIVESTOCK OPERATION REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Waste treatment. The following regulations as to waste treatment and
disposal shall apply to all intensive livestock operations:
      (1)   All facilities located at one site are to be considered as
components of one intensive livestock operation.
      (2)   All proposed waste storage facilities shall be designed to provide
a minimum storage for a period of 180 days of all animal waste, contaminated
runoff and wastewater generated by the intensive livestock operation, based on
the waste production and rainfall values as determined by Purdue University
Cooperative Extension Service. Additional storage shall be required if terms of
division (B) of this section should be applicable.
      (3)   All rainwater from roofs and other uncontaminated water shall be
diverted away from the waste storage facilities.
      (4)   Wastewater generated by the intensive livestock operation, such as
excess drinking water, clean-up water, milking parlor wastewater, milking house
wash water, and the like, shall not be discharged directly to a stream or field
tile; and consequently, must be discharged into the animal waste storage pit or
treated in an alternate manner approved by the Plan Commission and the County
Board of Health. Excess drinking water and milk house wash water may be treated
with a septic tank or absorption system approved by the Plan Commission and the
County Board of Health.
      (5)   Application equipment must have the capacity of spreading a 180-day
accumulation of waste in 18 days. The time required for spreading a load of
waste will vary, depending on the type of equipment used and the distance the
waste must be hauled. In calculating the time required for emptying holding
pits, a maximum of two loads per hour or 18 loads per day shall be used.
Additional time should be provided if the application land is a distance away
from the intensive livestock operation.
   (B)   Application lands. Sufficient applicant owned land or leased land must
be available for spreading of waste from intensive livestock operations. If
applicant relies on leased land for 50% or more of his required applicated
lands, then the owner and/or operator of the intensive livestock operation must
provide 270 days of storage to contain the waste throughout the growing season.
   (C)   Application rates. The following land area acreage application shall
be followed:
      (1)   One acre of application land shall be available for each livestock
per acre unit as set out in section § 152.146(A).
      (2)   Fifty percent of the application land must be within two miles of
the intensive livestock operation buildings and must either be owned by the
owner of the intensive livestock operation.
      (3)   If not, the owner of the intensive livestock operation must present
and submit to the Plan Commission a long-term lease granting permission to
apply waste on the leased ground that is used as application area.
   (D)   Application set-backs. For the complete table from this division,
refer to Appendix C: Intensive Livestock Operations; Application Setbacks, at
the end of this chapter.
   (E)   Application requirements in floodplain. All applications of manure in
a floodplain shall be either by injection or, if surface applied, then the
surface applied application shall be incorporated immediately into the soil no
later than the end of each working day.
   (F)   Requirements for injection. In all cases of injection of manure upon
land, the injection of the same shall be at a minimum depth of three inches and
manure shall not be allowed to seep upon the surface of the soil.
   (G)   General requirements for incorporation. In the case of incorporation
of manure in all zones set out in division (D) above, and in Appendix C, the
manure shall be disked or plowed into the soil so as to completely cover the
manure to prevent any runoff. In application by incorporation in other than a
floodplain, the incorporation shall be accomplished, weather permitting, within
a minimum period of 48 hours after application. However, application in a
floodplain shall be accomplished no later than the end of each working day.

intensive livestock operation regulations as set forth in § 152.147 are
incorporated in this section as if the same were herein set out in full, and
each facility shall be constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with
the requirements and regulations as set forth therein.
   (B)   Waste treatment and disposal.
      (1)   All proposed waste storage facilities shall be designed to provide
a minimum storage for a period as provided in § 152.147 of all animal waste,
contaminated runoff, and wastewater generated by the intensive livestock
operation, based on the waste production and rainfall values as determined by
Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service, or the manure management
policy issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
      (2)   All rainwater from roofs and other uncontaminated water shall be
diverted away from the waste storage facilities.
      (3)   Wastewater generated by the intensive livestock operation (such as
excess drinking water, clean-up water, milking parlor water, milking house wash
water, and the like) shall not be discharged directly into a stream or field
tile. Instead, this wastewater shall be discharged into an animal waste storage
pit or treated in an approved alternate manner. Excess drinking water and milk
house wash water may be treated with an approved septic tank of absorption
system as may be approved by the County Health Department. Any approvals
required under this division shall be given by the County Board of Health and/
or the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (or any other state
agency which may regulate disposal and treatment of animal waste).
   (C)   Earthen pit design. Earthen pits shall be designed to prevent
percolation of the waste into the underlying groundwater and to provide levees
which are stable and can be satisfactorily maintained. A pit shall be located

waste treatment and handling facilities and/or any other facility of the
operation have not been constructed or have not been maintained and operated as

ground over which it is erected. These limits include the space necessary to
allow for installation hardware.
   (E)   Securing projecting wall signs. No projecting wall sign shall be
secured with wire, strips of wood or nails, nor shall any projecting sign be
hung or secured to any other sign. All wall signs shall be safely and securely

is placed and the person maintaining the sign are each fully responsible for
the condition and the maintenance of the sign and the area around the sign.
(Ord. 570, passed 2-26-07)
§ 152.176 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Intent. This subchapter is intended to encourage the eventual
elimination of signs that do not comply with the sign standards. The
elimination of non-conforming signs is as much a subject of health, safety, and
welfare as is the prohibition of new signs in violation of these standards.
Therefore, this subchapter attempts to realize the removal of non-conforming
signs and to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights.
   (B)   Amortization. A sign not complying with these standards, but in place
on the effective date of this subchapter, shall be removed, or brought into
compliance with these standards, within 15 years after the effective date of
this subchapter. The following information concerning each existing sign
location shall be provided: the name and address of the owner of the sign; the
name of owner, address and parcel identification number of real property on
which the sign is located; the height, area, and dimensions of the sign face,
and setback from the right-of-way. No initial permit fees shall be charged, but
a registration tag shall be issued by the Department to be placed on the ground
sign or kept on file pursuant to §
152.174(F). Failure to register existing outdoor advertising signs in
accordance with these provisions shall be considered a violation of this
subchapter.
   (C)   Permit. Within six months after the effective date of this subchapter,
the person owning a non-conforming sign shall apply for a permit to the
Department. The Department shall issue the permit for not more than 15 years.
   (D)   Continuance. A non-conforming sign may be continued during the
amortization period if it is maintained in good condition. It shall not,
however, be replaced by another nonconforming sign, expanded, or moved to
another location unless brought into conformance. It may not be structurally
altered so as to prolong the life of the sign. It may not be reestablished
after damage or destruction if the Department determines that the estimated
cost of reconstruction exceeds 50% of the estimated replacement cost.
   (E)   Removal of signs.  It is the intent of this section to recognize the
eventual elimination, as expeditiously as it is reasonable, of existing signs
that are not in conformity with the provisions of these standards, inasmuch as
a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs
that would violate the provisions of these standards. It is also the intent of
this section that any elimination of nonconforming, obsolete, unsafe and
unlawful signs shall be affected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established private rights. However, except where it may cause a breach of the
peace, the Department may physically remove a sign or have a sign removed from
a property where a sign is in violation to insure compliance with these
provisions; provided however that the owners must have had ten days' written
notice by certified mail of the violation and further provided that the owners
have been requested by such notice to remove the sign which is in violation of
these standards. The sign owner and property owner may be jointly and severally
liable for the expense of removal. Notice of the cost of removal shall be
served upon the sign owner and property owner by certified mail. If said sum is
not paid within 30 days thereafter, said sum shall be collected by the city in
a civil action in the nature of debt.
   (F)   Unsafe and unlawful signs. If the Department finds that any sign
regulated herein is structurally unsafe; constitutes a hazard to safety or
health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or abandonment,
defined as having no active copy on an outdoor advertising sign within the past
90 days or the advertisement of a business, concern or use that has been closed
for greater than 90 days; is not kept in good repair; is capable of causing
electrical shocks to persons likely to come in contact with it; or is
unlawfully installed, erected or maintained; the Department shall give written
notice to the sign owner and property owner thereof, and may proceed to remove
the sign pursuant to division (E) above.
(Ord. 570, passed 2-26-07)
§ 152.177 FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION.
   The placement of directional signs, residential neighborhood signs,
historical site signs, and flags is specifically authorized in these standards.

to administer and enforce these standards. Included among such powers are the
following specific powers:
      (1)   The Department shall issue permits, as required by these standards.
The Department shall also ensure that signs comply with these standards and any
other applicable law.
      (2)   Every sign for which a permit is required shall be subject to the
inspection and approval of the Department. Upon presentation of proper
identification to the sign owner or owner's agent, the Department may enter the
sign area for purposes of inspecting the sign, sign structure, and any
fasteners securing the sign to a building or support. In cases of emergency,
where imminent hazards to persons or property are known to exist, and where the
sign owner, or owner's agent, is not readily available, the Department may
enter the sign area for purposes of inspection or remediation. When on private
property, the Department shall observe rules and regulations concerning safety,
internal security, and fire protection. If the Department is denied admission
to inspect any sign, inspection shall be made only under authority of a warrant
issued by a court of proper jurisdiction. When applying for such warrant, the
Department shall submit an affidavit setting forth a belief that a violation of
these standards exists with respect to a particular sign, and the reasons for
forming this belief The affidavit shall designate the place and name of the
person believed to own or possess the sign. If the court finds probable cause
exists for the search of the sign, and supporting structures, then a warrant
authorizing the search shall be issued. The warrant shall describe the property
with sufficient certainty to identify the same. This warrant shall constitute
authority for the Department to enter the sign area and to inspect the
property.
      (3)   Upon issuance of a stop order from the Department, work on any sign
that is being conducted in any manner contrary to these standards shall be
immediately stopped. This notice and order shall be in writing and shall be
given to the owner of the parcel, the sign owner, or to the person performing
the work. The stop order shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed. The city Police Department shall have authority to enforce a stop
order.
      (4)   The Department has the authority to revoke any permit authorized by
these standards if the sign violates these standards or another law, provided
that the Department shall offer the sign owner an opportunity to be heard. The
person whose permit is under consideration shall be given at least ten days'
written notice of the time, place, and reason for the hearing. The sign owner
and/or person identified in the permit shall be permitted to present relevant
facts and legal argument concerning the pending revocation. Following this
hearing, the Department shall consider the merits of the case and shall present
a written opinion prior to any action. If, however, the Department believes the
health, safety, or welfare of the citizens is endangered by any violation of
these standards, the Department may immediately revoke any sign permits.
      (5)   A sign installed after the effective date of these standards, and
not conforming to these standards, shall be removed by the owner. The sign
owner shall not be entitled to compensation for the sign removal and shall
reimburse the Department for any costs incurred in connection with the removal.
      (6)   Any person, firm or corporation, agent employee, or contractor of
such who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who
resists enforcement of any provisions of this subchapter, shall be guilty of a
Class C misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not
less than $25 dollars nor more than $500 for each offense, together with the
costs of prosecution. Each day on which a violation occurs shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition, the City Attorney is authorized to take all
action, legal, injunctive and equitable, to assure compliance with these
standards.
   (C)   Variances.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to hear
and act upon applications for a variance where there are practical hardships in
the manner of carrying out the strict letter of any provisions of these
standards. If a variance is granted, it shall be the least possible deviation
from the requirements of these standards. In granting any variance, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with these standards. Violations of the provisions of the variance
granted, including any conditions or safeguards that are a part of the grant of
the variance, shall be deemed a violation of these standards. Variances may be
issued upon finding that an application meets the following requirements:
      (1)   If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of these
standards, the applicant can make no reasonable use of the sign allowed; and
      (2)   If the hardship of which the applicant complains is unique, or
nearly so, and is suffered by the applicant rather than by owners of
surrounding properties or the general public; and
      (3)   If the hardship relates to the applicant's land (such as the size,
shape, topography, terrain, ideation or surroundings of the site) rather than
in personal circumstances or the type of business; and
      (4)   If the hardship is not a result of the applicant's own actions; and
      (5)   If the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of these standards and preserves its spirit and if the variance secures the
pubic safety and welfare and does substantial justice.
   (D)   Right of appeal. Any person aggrieved by any ruling of any person
charged with the administration of these standards may take an appeal to the
Zoning Board of Appeals. An appeal of a decision shall be taken within 30 days
after such decision is made.
   (E)   Jurisdiction. Appeals taken from requests relating to construction
shall be filed with the Building Department and shall be subject to the
procedures established by the Building Department, and are not subject to the
provisions of this section. The Zoning Board of Appeals (hereinafter referred
to as the Board), is hereby vested with the following jurisdiction and
authority:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by any person charged with the administration of
these standards, except appeals relating to construction issues. The Board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify or amend the order,
requirement or decision or determination appealed from to the extent and in the
manner that the Board may decide to be fitting and proper on the premises, and
to that end, the Board shall also have all the power of the officer from whom
the appeals are taken.

required to pass under these standards.
      (3)   To hear and pass upon applications for variances from a strict
application of the terms of these standards as set forth in division (C) above.
(Ord. 570, passed 2-26-07)
§ 152.179 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   The provisions of these standards are minimum requirements. Whenever the
requirements of these standards are found to be in conflict with the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted statute, rule, regulation,
ordinance, deed restriction or covenant, the most restrictive or that imposing
the higher standard shall prevail.
(Ord. 570, passed 2-26-07)
§ 152.180 VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   These standards, and its parts, are declared to be severable. Should any
section, clause, provision or portion of these standards be declared by a court

FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
§ 152.185 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health.
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area.
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas.
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain.
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible.
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure with a floor area of 400 square feet or
less that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure; an accessory
structure specifically excludes structures used for human habitation.
      (1)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are considered walled and roofed where the
structure includes at least two outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof.
      (2)   Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES include but are not necessarily
limited to two-car detached garages (or smaller), carports, storage and tool

hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved other means without granting a variance,  even if the alternative is
more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the
parcel to a different use than originally intended.

be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.

currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or  building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL. FEMA's modification of the

         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA

§ 152.187 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this subchapter applies. This subchapter shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the city
as identified in §
152.187(B), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, flood way, and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an “AE
Zone” on the Adams County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated
September 29, 2010, shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Adams County and Incorporated Areas
and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated September 29,
2010, as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. Should the
floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied
SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the limits of the floodway will be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, flood way, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of city, delineated as an “A Zone” on
the Adams County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated
September 29, 2010, as well as any updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be
according to the best available flood layer provided by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site
is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available flood layer data, the party needs to replace existing data with
better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this
data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this subchapter and other applicable regulations.
      (2)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this subchapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
      (3)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable
regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This subchapter is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this subchapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone AE) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
subchapter all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements.
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability on the part of the
city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on this subchapter, or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this subchapter. All violations shall be considered a common
nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the zoning
code for the city. All violations shall be punishable by a fine of $100
minimum, not exceeding $500.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The City Planning Commission shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

application for a floodplain development permit shall be made to the Floodplain
Administrator for all development activities located wholly within, partially
within, or in contact with an identified special flood hazard area. Such
application shall be made by the owner of the property or his or her authorized
agent, herein referred to as the applicant, prior to the actual commencement of
such construction on a form furnished for that purpose. Such applications shall
include, but not be limited to plans drawn to scale showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or
proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following

compliance. The Floodplain Administrator shall have a right, upon presentation
of proper credential, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the Department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action.
   (E)   Map maintenance activities. To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have
flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the city's flood
maps, studies and other data identified in §152.187(B) accurately represent
flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on
current data, the following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries.
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area.
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online letter of map
change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
         (d)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the President of the
Common Council of the city, and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the Adams County and
incorporated areas flood insurance rate map accurately represent the city's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the city
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the city has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (F)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board) as established by Common
Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error
in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this subchapter. Any
person aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the
Adams County Circuit Court.
      (3)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this subchapter and:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (f)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (g)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (h)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (i)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters at the site.
         (j)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (5)   Variances from the provisions of this subchapter shall only be
granted when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence
submitted at the hearing for the following:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship as defined in §152.186.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (6)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
152.189(A)(1),
152.189(A)(3)(a) or
152.189(A)(4) of this subchapter may be granted.
      (7)   Any variance granted in a flood way subject to §§
152.189(A)(1),
152.189(A)(3)(a) or
152.189(A)(4) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
      (8)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
152.189 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (9)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
      (10)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
      (11)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (12)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this subchapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this subchapter.
      (13)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (14)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 466, §§3-3-1, 3-5-1, passed 5-11-98; Am. Ord. 608, passed 9-13-10; Am.
Ord. 763, passed 8-14-23) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.189 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   Floodplain status standards.
      (1)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.187(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
         (a)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
152.187(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this section.
         (c)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
         (d)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and
meeting requirements of §
152.188(E)(1). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
         (e)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as
an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot
as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
         (f)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
      (2)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified
on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
through detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit
provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (3)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
         (a)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license
qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
         (b)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
            2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (4)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
         (a)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
   (B)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction, reconstruction or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure, and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (4)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG.
      (5)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (8)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter shall
meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this subchapter.
      (9)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (10)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this subchapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
      (11)   Fill projects that do not involve a structure must be protected
against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk
heading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
   (C)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data or flood depths have been provided, as set forth in §
152.187(B), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Building protection requirement. In addition to the general
standards described in §
152.189(B), structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of a residential structure.
         (b)   Construction or placement of a non-residential structure.
         (c)   Addition or improvement made to an existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land). An addition and/or

COMMERCIAL ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
§ 152.230 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Title. This subchapter shall be known as the commercial architectural
review subchapter of the city and may be so cited.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Common Council of the city hereby finds that the city has for
many years carefully nurtured its Swiss customs and many commercial buildings
have been erected and reconstructed to create recognizably Swiss-themed
structures, and today the city welcomes all visitors with the warmth of old
world charm and Swiss hospitality and that many communities today, including
the city are experiencing a widespread, and profitable, ethnic rebirth. Across
the country, once dormant small towns and inner-city neighborhoods are
organizing new ethnic festivals, rediscovering forgotten recipes and
constructing landscapes that reflect the hunger for heritage among contemporary
“hyphenated” Americans. Much of this refashioning of ethnicity stems from a
heightening self-consciousness of group identity and a new ability to
capitalize on the recognizable symbols of that identity. In short, a new ethnic
form is emerging, and one that is based on the twin concerns of public memory
and tourism. The city recognizes many local efforts to create recognizably
Swiss-themed places in its commercial buildings and structures.
      (2)   In addition, the city finds that bizarre, garish or otherwise
inappropriate exterior design and appearance of buildings, structures and
improvements erected in commercial areas adversely affects the desirability of
immediately adjacent and neighboring properties, impairs the benefits of
occupancy as to existing properties in such areas, and in the city as a whole,
and prevents the optimum use of real estate in the city.
   (C)   Therefore, in order to encourage the construction of attractive
buildings which create recognizably themed places by the designation of
architectural review districts, to protect and promote the general welfare and
to prevent deterioration of the appearance of the city which would tend to
create hazards to public health, safety and morals, destroy opportunity for the
development of business and industry, and thereby deteriorate taxable land
values and commence below levels necessary to finance acceptable levels of
municipal services, it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the
designation of architectural review districts and to establish a Committee to
preview the exterior appearance of buildings, structures, and improvements
proposed for alteration or erection in such districts and to set standards and
procedures to be followed by such Committee.
(Ord. 649, passed 2-10-14)
§ 152.231 DESIGNATION OF ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW DISTRICTS.
   (A)   All land areas in the city which are zoned commercial, including
corresponding Commercial Planned Unit Zones, (C-l, C-1P, C-2, C-2P, C-3, C-3P),
and also uses on any lot, parcel or area of land that are commercial in nature
but not zoned commercial (C-l, C-1P, C-2, C-2P, C-3, C-3P) are hereby
designated as an architectural review district. Specifically, this shall be
interpreted to include any lot, parcel or area of land in residential or
industrial zones that are granted special exceptions, special uses, contingent
uses or variances that permit commercial uses in such zones.
   (B)   All proposed construction shall be in compliance with all ordinances
of the city including specifically the zoning ordinance, site plan ordinance,
sign ordinance, commercial architectural review ordinance, and commercial
landscape requirements ordinance.
(Ord. 649, passed 2-10-14)
§ 152.232 APPROVAL OF ERECTIONS, RECONSTRUCTIONS AND ALTERATIONS IN
ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW DISTRICTS REQUIRED; WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   No structure, building, or other improvements or other major landscape
features surrounding such building, structure or improvement located on any
land within any architectural review district shall be erected, reconstructed,
altered or restored until the plans for such shall have been reviewed by the
architectural review committee. All reconstructions, alterations and
restorations that require a permit from the city or that affect the exterior
appearance of the structure, building or improvement shall require the review
by the Committee. Provided, that the provisions of this subchapter shall not
apply to the regular maintenance of the same as opposed to the repainting of a
structure or building which results in the complete change of color of the
structure or building or a substantial portion thereof which shall be deemed an
alteration and not regular maintenance. Erection, reconstruction, alteration or
restoration of signs shall be controlled by the sign ordinance of the city.
   (B)   From the date of preview by the architectural review committee of any
structure, building, improvements, major landscape features surrounding such
building, or structure or improvement located on any land within any
architectural review district construction must begin and/or a building permit
must be obtained no later than one year thereafter. Failure to meet this
deadline will nullify the prior application process and will require a new
application to be filed by the applicant.
(Ord. 649, passed 2-10-14)
§ 152.233 DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS.
   (A)   Intent. The intention of the Common Council of the city is that no
proposed structure or alteration shall be deemed to be in violation of this
subchapter based upon personal preference to taste or choice of architectural
design of any person or persons involved in the administration and enforcement
of this subchapter. Only the recommendations listed in the divisions below will
be considered while evaluating proposed construction.
   (B)   Standards. The following standards shall be considered for
applications filed under this subchapter:
      (1)   Typical elements of traditional Bern-area Swiss architecture
include low-pitched roofs, expansive roof overhangs, roof materials featuring
tile, simulated tile, high profile asphalt shingles, or heavy shakes, stucco or
stucco-like wall materials, balconies, scrolled slats, flower boxes, arched
doorways, shutters, traditional scrolling or Rococo designs, and stucco color
of white or off-white. The Architectural Review Committee may develop more
detailed design suggestions and criteria acceptable to the Committee.
      (2)   Whether or not the proposed structure, building or improvement is
compatible with existing well-designed structures, acceptable to the Committee,
in the vicinity and in the city as a whole.
      (3)   Whether or not, in terms of design, material, texture, color,
lighting, landscaping, dimension, line or mass or roof line and height, the
proposed structure, building or improvement is designed to serve primarily as
an advertisement or commercial display, exhibits exterior characteristics
likely to deteriorate rapidly, would be of temporary or short-term architecture
or aesthetic acceptability, would be plainly offensive to human sensibilities
or would otherwise constitute a reasonable foreseeable detriment to the
community.
   (C)   Matrix. The matrix attached to Ch. 152, Appendix D, will be utilized
by the Review Committee in determining the incentives received by an applicant
filing under this subchapter.
   (D)   Parking lots. All parking lots shall be constructed of either asphalt
or concrete, bounded with curb and gutters. Curbs must be fabricated concrete.
Specifications must conform to those of the subdivision regulations of the
city.
   (E)   Utility service and equipment. In an effort to enhance the aesthetic
quality of the commercial community, underground communications and electric
service building connection lines are encouraged in architectural review
districts. Underground communications and electric service lines may be
required.
   (F)   Exterior equipment. Air conditioning, heating, electric generators,
exhaust duct, exhaust fans, exhaust blowers, refrigeration equipment and any
other equipment located on roof, wall or on site shall satisfy the following
requirements:
      (1)   Exterior equipment should be located out of the public view.
      (2)   If the location of equipment must be in public view, a substantial
screen, fence and/or landscaping must be used to make the equipment obscure.
   (G)   Waste disposal. In a growing, progressive, commercial community, it is
necessary to protect, and to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare with aesthetics that will convey to new business and consumers that the
city invites and welcomes them to the community. Waste generated by normal
business activities and its disposal should be carefully planned to achieve
this concept.
      (1)   Waste disposal receptacles are to be located on the site in an area
that is not considered the focal point of the complex. Usually this will be in
the rear of the building or structure, or to the rear limits of the property.
The waste disposal receptacle site must be readily accessible to Fire
Department access.
      (2)   Waste disposal receptacles shall be screened from public view by
the use of an architectural masonry, brick, ornamental iron or wood closure
that is compatible with the aesthetics of the surrounding area. The use of an
attractively designed gate is required. Landscaping shall be incorporated in a
manner to effectively help obscure the waste disposal receptacle.
      (3)   The location, screening and landscaping of waste disposal
receptacles shall be recommended by the architectural review committee.
   (H)   Accessory buildings. Accessory buildings and structures located in an
architectural review district shall meet all the requirements set forth in the
architectural review subchapter, the International Building Codes, 2006
Edition, as promulgated by the International Code Council, its successors and
assigns, and the flood management ordinance.
      (1)   Manufactured buildings and structures, mobile homes, temporary
office units, manufactured storage sheds or buildings, trucks, truck trailers,
buses and other temporary facilities are not allowed to be used as an accessory
building.
      (2)   Temporary facilities may be allowed on commercial construction
sites during and up to completion.
(Ord. 649, passed 2-10-14)
§ 152.234 BUILDING RELOCATION.
   (A)   Any building or structure that is moved within or into the commercial
community shall meet, or be made to meet, the requirements set forth in §§
152.233(C) through (G), as well as all requirements as set out in Ord. 284, as
amended.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator or his/her designee shall make an inspection
on the proposed building or structure to be moved. A written report of this
inspection shall be submitted to the Architectural Review Committee.
   (C)   An affidavit is required from a certified environmental contractor
that the proposed building or structure to be moved is free from asbestos,
lead, pesticide, or any other contamination that may be dangerous, harmful, or
health concern. This affidavit shall be submitted with the application for
approval.
(Ord. 649, passed 2-10-14)

determining that the requirements of §
152.233(A) have been satisfied, shall distribute a copy of the application to
each member of the Architectural Review Committee. There shall be no
application fee charged for filing this application.
