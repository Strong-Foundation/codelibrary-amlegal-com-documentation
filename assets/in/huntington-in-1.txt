§ 36.05 STIPULATIONS CONCERNING PAYMENT OF PENALTY.
   (A)   Separate and multiple violations. A separate and distinct violation of
any of the code provisions referenced in §
36.04 constitutes a separate offense, which may result in multiple violations
and increasing penalties as indicated. In circumstances where there exists a
continuing act or omission, or a continuing existing condition, which
constitutes a violation, every day that violation continues shall constitute a
separate offense. The payment of a penalty for the violation of any of the
above provisions shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue, nor
shall such payment prevent the enforced correction of any prohibited act,
omission, or condition.
   (B)   Liability for personal injury or property damage. The payment of a
penalty for any code violation, as provided in this chapter, shall not relieve
the violator from any liability for personal injury or property damage arising
out of the violating act, omission, or condition, and the city or third persons
may pursue any and all other legal remedies for such injury or damage.
   (C)   Aiding and abetting. Any person who knowingly or intentionally aids,
induces or causes another person to commit a violation of this chapter commits
that violation, even if the other person has not been charged with, or
adjudicated to be in violation of, a violation of this chapter.

recorded by the City Clerk-Treasurer's bookkeeper in the year that such changes
occur. If a gravel road is paved or if a road is totally redone beyond milling
as paving or chip sealing, such improvement shall be considered a capital asset
if the cost is $5,000 or greater.
      (2)   Normal department operating activities regarding infrastructures
such as feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, and design will be
expensed rather than capitalized.
(Ord. 1-C-05, passed 2-22-05)
§ 37.09 DEPRECIATION.
   Effective January 1, 2021, a capital asset meeting the criteria will be
reported and depreciated in the government-wide financial statements with the
exception of land, which will not be depreciated, and construction in progress,
which will not be depreciated until it is transferred upon completion to the
appropriate capital asset category.
(Ord. 15-C-21, passed 10-26-21)
§ 37.10 REPORTED VALUE OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   Annual updating and reporting. Capital assets shall be recorded at
historical cost, which includes any ancillary charges necessary to place the
asset into its intended location and condition for use. Ancillary charges
include, for example, freight and transportation charges, site preparation
costs, and professional fees. Engineering costs (internal and external) include
related preliminary project and environmental studies; project estimating,
design, and planning (drawings and specifications); and construction
engineering, construction management, construction inspection and project
payment. However, no such costs shall be capitalized unless they can be
directly identified to a specific capital asset and have been incurred
subsequent to the determination that the capital asset will, in fact, be
acquired (the costs of a feasibility study are not capitalizable, nor are other
costs related to the project occurring prior to its completion). Donated
capital assets are recorded at the value that would be necessary to acquire
them.
(Ord. 15-C-21, passed 10-26-21)
§ 37.11 ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS.
   Capital assets have estimated useful lives extending beyond a single
reporting period (one year) and are depreciated using the straight-line method
with no allowance for salvage value. The estimated useful lives currently used
were developed with the input of knowledgeable staff and reflect the
government's experience with these assets. However, a shorter or longer
estimated life may be used depending on factual circumstances including
climate, usage, replacement policies, industry practices, and Internal Revenue
Service depreciation recovery period and ADS lives:
   (A)   Land: non-depreciable;
   (B)   Improvements to land: 20 years;
   (C)   Buildings: 50 years;
   (D)   Furnishings and equipment: 5 years;
   (E)   Vehicles:
      (1)   Auto: 10 years;
      (2)   Light trucks: 10 years;
      (3)   Heavy trucks: 15 years;
      (4)   Heavy equipment (e.g. backhoe, clipper, vactor, sweeper, semi,
etc.): 20 years;
      (5)   Specialty light equipment (e.g. mowers, tractors, etc.): 15
years;   
      (6)   Specialty heavy equipment (e.g. dozers, loaders, trailers, etc.):
20 years;
      (7)   Police vehicles: 8 years;
      (8)   Fire vehicles:
         (a)   Towers/ladder: 20 years;

§ 37.13 CALCULATION OF STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.
   Under the straight-line depreciation method, the basis for an asset is
written off evenly over the useful life of the asset. The same amount of
depreciation is taken each year. The amount of annual depreciation is generally
determined by dividing an asset's depreciable cost by its estimated life.

   (B)   The control or elimination of cross-connections shall be in accordance
with the then effective provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code (327 IAC
8-10) and this code. The policies, procedures and criteria for determining
appropriate levels of protection shall be in accordance with the IDEM Cross
Connection Control & Backflow Prevention Manual: 2013 Edition, as published by
the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, of the
University of Southern California, or the then most current superseding edition
or amendment of that manual. The materials are incorporated herein by reference
and two copies of the materials referenced shall be available for inspection
and copying at the Clerk-Treasurer's office during normal business hours.
   (C)   The Water Department shall deny or discontinue water service to any
user failing to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, testing, or
inspection of backflow prevention assemblies.

prevention assemblies shall be installed, tested, and properly maintained in
all customer facilities:
      (1)   Where they exist as of the date of adoption of this provision of
the code. (December 12, 1995).
      (2)   Constructed after July 17, 1985, which are designated as a cross-
connection hazard by the then effective provisions of 327 IAC 8-10.
      (3)   Where a backflow incident occurs on or after November 1, 1995,
which results in a containment or a pollutant being introduced into the
distribution system.
   (E)   "An approved backflow assembly" means a backflow prevention assembly
model approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the
Department. The Department shall maintain a list of approved backflow
prevention assemblies. The assembly shall be matched to the degrees of hazard
and to the approved installation application.
   (F)   The Department, Water Department, and such staff members as either may
designate, are delegated the authority to inspect, approve, and disapprove
backflow prevention assemblies for installation, corrections, modifications,
repairs, or maintenance on backflow prevention assemblies and to inspect all
locations where backflow prevention assemblies may be required. A minimum
standard for the maintenance and installation of backflow prevention assemblies
shall be those set forth in the IDEM Cross Connection Control & Backflow
Prevention Manual: 2013 Edition, as published by the Foundation for Cross-
Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, of the University of Southern
California, or the then most current superseding edition or amendment of that
manual. The Department is authorized to establish higher standards for
installation and maintenance of backflow prevention assemblies where it finds
that good engineering practice, industry standards or the protection of public
health requires such higher standards. Any such higher standards are subject to
review and modification by the Board upon written request filed with the city's
Clerk-Treasurer by any interested party. However, pending that review those
higher standards shall be enforced if, in the judgment of the Department, the
public interest so requires.

supplied, accessible to the Department or Water Department personnel at all
reasonable times to determine whether backflow prevention assemblies are
required or are properly installed and maintained.
   (H)   The city prohibits interconnection of private water supplies with the
distribution system. Auxiliary water supplies (private wells, piped irrigation
sources, etc.) are a major cross-connection control hazard and therefore must
be effectively isolated from the distribution system.
   (I)   All backflow assemblies shall be tested in accordance with the then
effective provisions of 327 IAC 8-10 or more frequently if the Department
determines such is required to protect the public health or water quality. The
assembly shall be tested in accordance with the IDEM Cross Connection Control &
Backflow Prevention Manual: 2013 Edition, as published by the Foundation for
Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, of the University of Southern
California, or the then most current superseding edition or amendment of said
manual. All backflow prevention assemblies shall have additional tests
performed to determine the overall soundness of the backflow preventor. The
additional tests shall be conducted in accordance with then current written
procedures in the Department.
   (J)   The gauge used to test backflow prevention assemblies shall be
certified as to accuracy by the gauge manufacturer on an annual basis. It is
the responsibility of the certified backflow prevention device tester to obtain
and show proof of the accuracy of each gauge annually.
   (K)   A Cross Connection Control Device Inspector, as defined in 327 IAC 8-
10-1, as amended, includes a private inspector hired by the city or user for
this purpose.
   (L)   All test reports shall be submitted on a test report form to the
Department.
   (M)   The user shall bear all costs of installation, testing, and
maintenance, together with all other charges associated with backflow
prevention assemblies.

in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
      (3)   Any wastewater containing in excess of 210 mg/l BOD or 230 mg/l TSS
will be surcharged as high strength wastewater as provided in §
51.103. The issuance of surcharges for treating high strength wastewater shall
not be construed as acceptance of high strength wastewater for treatment by the
City of Huntington. The city reserves the right and authority to prohibit the
discharge of high strength wastewater when such wastewaters cause or are
reasonably expected to cause POTW upsets, overloading or damage to the sewer
collection system.
   (E)   City’s right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW.
   (F)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Board may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

§ 51.064 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §
51.063(A) within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the
Board, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Board for review, and shall be acceptable to the Board before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the
provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Board may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   The Board may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Fats, grease, oil and/or sand interceptors shall be provided when,
as determined by the Board, such interceptors are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater from commercial, industrial, governmental, and/or
institutional users, which wastewater is likely to contain excessive amounts of
fats, grease and/or oil, or sand. All such interceptors shall be of sufficient
size and design and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations
established by the Board from time to time. Those interceptors shall be so
located to be reasonably accessible for cleaning and inspection. It shall be
the responsibility and at the cost of the user and owner to inspect, clean and
repair each interceptor as necessary to result in that interceptor being able
to do the job for which it was designed and installed, and to insure that the
cover is in place and securely closed at all times except as appropriate during
use, inspection, cleaning and repair. Failure to maintain the interceptor in
proper working order shall be cause for discontinuance of sewer service as
determined by the Board.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two
years, the Board shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs
an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Board may require any user to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the
Board may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Board of any accidental or
slug discharge; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage ares, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

§ 51.065 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Board, a user must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days
of the request. The Board is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and
may periodically require users to update this information.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
      (1)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Board,
except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application
pursuant to division (C) of this section may continue to discharge for the time
period specified therein. The Board may collect samples of any hauled loads to
insure compliance.
      (2)   The Board may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge
permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this subchapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§
51.071 through
51.073. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of
its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or
requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law.
   (C)   Wastewater discharge permitting existing connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater
into the POTW prior to the effective date of this subchapter and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 90 days after that date,
apply to the Board for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with
division (E) of this section, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the
POTW to continue after 180 days of the effective date of this subchapter except
in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Board.
   (D)   Wastewater discharge permitting new connections. Any user required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence
discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit, in accordance with division (E) of this section, must be filed at least
90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
   (E)   Wastewater discharge permit application contents. All users required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The
Board may require all users to submit as part of an application the following
information:
         (a)   All information required by §

         (g)   Time and duration of discharges; and
         (h)   Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Board to
evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application.
      (2)   Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the user for revision.
   (F)   Application signatories and certification. The following certification
statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit
applications: “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   (G)   Wastewater discharge permit decisions. The Board will evaluate the
data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within 30

streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process.
            2.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature
and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the Board,
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass,
where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
division (J) of this section.
            3.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in division (K) of this section.
         (f)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion

this section must meet the requirements set out in division (B) of this
section.
         (h)   Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.065(F).
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(2) of this section:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Board no later than
14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken
by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Board.
   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
      (1)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Board a report containing the information described in division (A)(2)(d)
through (f) of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.065(F).
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined
by the Board but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December),
submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Board or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.065(F).
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Board, using the
procedures prescribed in division (K) of this section, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Board of any
planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before
the change.
      (1)   The Board may require the user to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application under §
51.065(E).
      (2)   The Board may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
51.065(G) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
51.066(D) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Board of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration, and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Board, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (F)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Board
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Board as
the Board may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Board
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat
the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Board within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the
industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user’s
facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user
between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
user or the city receives the results of the sampling, or if the city has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this subdivision need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under division (E) of this section. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-
monitoring requirements of divisions (A), (C), and (D) of this section.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (I)(1)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Board, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in division (K)(2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection
techniques, unless time- proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Board. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Board, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the composite procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Board, as appropriate. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of basic monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports in Section 6.1 and 6.3 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum
of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Board may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by Section 6.4 [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(b)], the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance by applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   (L)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (M)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this subchapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documents associated with best management practices. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Board.

§ 51.068 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The Board shall have the
right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this subchapter and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Board ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Board will be permitted to enter without delay
for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Board shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The Board may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated 90 days to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Board and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Board access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this subchapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Board has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Board may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the Superior and Circuit Court of the city.

51.999
§ 51.069 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Board's inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.

§ 51.070 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Board shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published
in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which,
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant
noncompliance shall mean:
   (A)   Chronic violation of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirements, including instantaneous limits as
defined in §
51.063;
   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined
by §
51.063 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by §
51.063 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Board determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the
health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Board's exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of a best
management practice, which the Board determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

C-17, passed 11-28-17)
§ 51.071 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Board finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Board may serve upon that user a
written Notice of Violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Board. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Board to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Board may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions (D) and (E) of
this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Board may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Board and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Board finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Board may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Board may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,500. Such fines shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 10% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Board to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Board may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Board may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The Board may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Board may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Board
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Board may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Board that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in division (H) of this section are initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Board prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under divisions (C) or (H) of this section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in §
51.066(F), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
51.063.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Board shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.

§ 51.072 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Board finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board may petition the Superior and Circuit Court through the
City's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
subchapter on activities of the user. The Board may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for
a maximum civil penalty of $2,500 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Board may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this subchapter
are not exclusive. The Board may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the Board may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the Board is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 35-C-92, passed 11-10-92; Am. Ord. 23-C-17, passed 11-28-17)
§ 51.073 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Performance bonds. The Board may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this subchapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the Board to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The Board may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this subchapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (C)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (D)   Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Board. Any person(s) creating a
public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code
Chapter 98 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any
costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.

51.999
§ 51.074 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, “UPSET” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(3) below, are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the Board as
rapidly as is appropriate in the circumstances, and in all circumstances within
one hour of becoming aware of the upset if it is possible to do so. If this
information is provided orally, a reasonably detailed written submission must
be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
51.063(A)(1) or the specific prohibitions in §
51.063(A)(2)(a) through (p) excepting only §
51.063(A)(2)(h) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know,
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section,
         (a)   “BYPASS” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
         (b)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE” means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. “SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE” does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of division (C)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Board, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Board of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Board may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Board may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
of this section.
         (b)   The Board may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Board determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) of this section.

SEWER CHARGES
§ 51.100 USER CLASS.
   Every person whose premises are served by the sewage works shall be charged
for the services provided. These charges are established for each user class,
as defined, in order that the sewage works shall recover, from each user and
user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the treatment works in
terms of volume and load. User charges are levied to defray the cost of
operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works. User
charges shall be uniform in magnitude within a user class.
   (A)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency. Replacement costs which are

      (1)   Class I: Non Industrial
      (2)   Class II: Industrial
(Ord. 30-C-84, passed 10-9-84; Am. Ord. 8-C-99, passed 8-10-99)
§ 51.101 SEWAGE WORKS CHARGES.
   For the use of and the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate, or building that is connected with the city sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sewerage system. The rates and
charges include user charges, debt service costs, excessive strength
surcharges, and other service charges which rates and charges shall be payable
as quoted in
Appendix A.
   (A)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water
used on or in the property or premises subject to those rates and charges, as
the same is measured by the water therein used, except as herein otherwise
provided. Water meters will be read once each month, and sewage service bills
shall be rendered once each month (or period approximating a month). The water

§ 51.102 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sewerage system and obtained from
sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by the
city in a manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service
shall be billed at the above appropriate rates. Further, as is hereinafter
provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in determining
the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed,
but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that those quantities
do not enter the sewerage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the
water utility serving the city, and the water used thereon or therein is not
measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to
the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at that owner's
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge. If there is no meter or any adequate and
approved method of measurement for residential lots or residential parcels of
real estate, then the service charge for the sewage service shall be as quoted
in
Appendix A.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water
utility serving the city and, in addition, is a user of water from another
source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not
acceptable in the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates or charges,
the owner or other interested parties, shall, at his expense, install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of
sewage discharge.
   (C)   If two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, buildings, or
dwelling units discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then, in that case, for
billing purposes, the sewage rates and charges shall be based, either on the
quantity of water used on the property or premises subject to those rates and
charges, as the same is measured by a single water meter there in use and shown
by consumption records of the water utility, or on the number of residential
lots, parcels of real estate, buildings, or dwelling units served through the
single water meter times the fee as quoted in
Appendix A, whichever is greater. In the case of trailer parks, the number of
dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of
trailers located and installed in the park plus any other dwelling units served
through the meter.
   (D)   (1)   In order that the single-family domestic and residential users
of sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer
months of June, July, and August, the billing for sewage service for residences
or domestic users for those months shall be based upon the customer’s average
monthly usage as shown in city’s billing records.
      (2)   In addition to the adjustments provided in division (D)(l) and in
order that the single-family domestic and residential users of sewage service
shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns or sod installed as part of new
home construction, or to re-establish a lawn after home renovations; upon
notification to the Water Billing Department and sufficient cause being shown,
the billing for sewage service for residences or domestic users for a two month
period of either: (i) April and May, or (ii) September and October, shall be
based upon the customer's average monthly usage as shown in city's billing
records.
      (3)   In the event the water usage for the customer’s average monthly
usage as shown in city's billing records is greater than the water usage for
the lawn sprinkling months in division (D)(l) or (2), then the billing for
sewage services shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for
which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic or residential sewage
service as applicable to the sprinkling adjustment shall apply to each lot,
parcel of real estate, or building which is occupied and used as a single-
family residence. The sprinkling adjustment shall not apply to any premises
which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes. In
the event a portion of the premises shall be used for commercial or industrial
purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water served
through a separate meter and in that case the water usage as registered by the
water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes
would qualify under the sprinkling adjustment.
   (E)   In order that a residential user of the sewage works shall not be
penalized by the consequences of extremely cold winter temperatures, a
residential user may each year make an appropriate record with the Utility
Billing Department that such user intends to let water run to keep pipes from
freezing at that user's billing location for the January, February and March
billing periods. In that event, that location's wastewater (but not water)
billing for those billing periods shall be adjusted and limited to that
location's average wastewater billing during billing periods when water has not
been so let run, as reasonably determined by the Water Department.
   (F)   The Board is further authorized to enter into special rate contracts
with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable reductions in cost
to the sewage works can be determined, and the reduction shall be limited to
those reduced costs. Those proposed contracts shall be subject to the approval
of the Common Council of the city.
   (G)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building (i) discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the sewage
works, either directly or indirectly, (ii) uses water in excess of 4,000 cubic
feet per month, and (iii) it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that
a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot
enter the sewage works, then the user or authorized representative of the user
shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.

§ 51.103 SURCHARGE RATE.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the city shall base its
charges not only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the
stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat
and dispose of. The city shall require the industrial user to determine the
strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or
indirectly into the sewerage system, in such method as the city may deem
practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the
case, in order to determine the proper charge.
   (B)   The industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point available
to the city at all times.
      (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 210 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended
solids in excess of 230 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for
treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following
basis:
         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge as quoted in
Appendix A per pound for suspended solids received in excess of 230 milligrams
per liter of fluid.
         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional
charge as quoted in
Appendix A per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of
210 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical
oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest
copy of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial
Wastes", as written by the American Public Health Association, the American
Water Works Association, the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in
conformance with "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants," Regulation CFR Part 136, published in the Federal Register on
October 16, 1973.

   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the city in
the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner. The
owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall
have the right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of
determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided
that the examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept
and during the hours that the office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due
hereby are declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which the rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at 20 days after the date of mailing of the bill.

§ 51.105 RATE STUDY.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to
the various users or user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made
within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months of operation,
following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. The study shall
include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the
treatment of excessive treatment of excessive strength effluents from
industrial users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works
and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and
maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements, and capital improvements
to the waste treatment systems.
   (B)   Therafter, with reasonable regularity, the city shall cause a similar
study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the
rates and charges for wastewater services on a continuing basis. The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of
certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms
shall have experience in these studies, or by a combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall
determine to be best under the circumstances.

§ 51.106 SEWAGE WORKS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   The city shall make and enforce such bylaws and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe economical and efficient management of the city's
sewerage system, pumping stations and sewage treatment works, for the
construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewerage system,
and for the regulation, collection, rebating, and refunding of the rates and
charges.
   (B)   (1)   In the event that a sewer connection is made from any lot,
parcel of real estate, or building directly to one of the sewers, construction
of which is financed by the sewage works revenue bonds, or by the city, thus
precluding any assessments or charge against the lot, parcel of real estate, or
building for a local or lateral sewer to serve the property, then, and in that
case, the connection charge for residential users shall be as quoted in
Appendix A, and the connection charge for commercial or industrial users shall
be determined by the Board, but shall be not less than the sum as quoted in
Appendix A, which connection charge shall be levied against that lot, parcel of
real estate, or building as the case may be.
      (2)   The connection charge set out herein shall be over and above any
and all costs and charges for making the physical tap from the lot, parcel of
real estate, or building to the sewer, and in addition to the permit fee.
      (3)   In the event the connection charge is not paid as required, the
charge shall be collected in the manner provided by statute.

52.04   Finality
§ 52.01 CREDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Credits. A credit shall be granted for the wastewater treatment
charges assessed by reducing only the wastewater component of that billing to
the amount equal to that location's average wastewater billing during three
preceding billing periods, plus $20, for a user of the Waterworks or Sewage
Works who establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Utility Billing
Department that a significant portion of that user's metered water as billed in
one or two consecutive billing intervals was not, or was more likely than not,
collected and treated by the Sewage Works.
   (B)   Leak adjustments. A leak adjustment shall be granted when user's water
and sewer usage for a monthly billing period exceeds the greater of $20 or 20%
above that user's anticipated billing for that location's average water and
wastewater billing during three preceding billing periods, is the result of
deterioration, malfunction, or a vandalism of that distribution system on the
user's side of the meter (the "cause"), for a user of the Waterworks or Sewage
Works who establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Utility Billing
Department that situation is:
      (1)   Not the result of or materially contributed to by an intentional
act or the gross negligence of the user or an occupant, tenant, or permittee of
the property served through that meter; and
      (2)   The cause is reasonably believed by the Water Department to have
been eliminated using adequate materials, workmanship, or preventive measures
as appropriate.
The leak adjustment shall reduce a user's monthly billing to an amount equal to
that location's average water and wastewater billing during three billing
periods immediately preceding the leak, plus a charge for the actual metered
water usage exceeding the average monthly usage at the then-current rate per
cubic feet as stated in §
50.10(B) in the row titled "Over 33,165 cubic feet" for all such additional
usage for that billing period. The total amount of the user's monthly billing
after applying the leak adjustment shall not be less than the user's average
billing for the three preceding billing periods unaffected by that cause, plus
$20.
   (C)   Not more than one such leak adjustment per meter site (which may be
included within either one or two consecutive billing period(s)) shall be
allowed in any consecutive 12 monthly billing periods.
   (D)   In the event of a leak which spans two consecutive billing periods,
the same three billing periods preceding the leak shall be used to compute the
leak adjustment for both billing periods.

§ 52.02 REPEATED APPLICATIONS.
   Repeated applications for wastewater treatment credits and/or leak
adjustments (by the same customer, or that customer's affiliates, or for the
same metered location), shall be held to increasingly higher burdens of proof
(e.g. a clear and convincing standard) of eligibility for such adjustment/
credit hereunder.
(Ord. 5-C-01, passed 6-12-01)
§ 52.03 INITIAL DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Applications for credit or adjustment under this chapter shall be
initially determined by the city employee with responsibility in the city's
water/sewer department as designated by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
City's water/wastewater department shall also offer the customer the option of
a payment plan for repayment of the balance owed to city for utility services.
   (B)   City's water/wastewater department shall make an initial determination
for a payment plan to customers to repay delinquent amounts owed to city for
utility services.
   (C)   All payment plans offered by city's water/wastewater department shall
be on terms approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
(Ord. 5-C-01, passed 6-12-01; Am. Ord. 32-C-22, passed 12-13-22)
§ 52.04 FINALITY.
   (A)   Initial determinations by the water/sewer department with regard to
granting wastewater treatment credits and leak adjustments as set out above in
this chapter may be appealed to the Board of Public Works and Safety in
accordance with that Board's policies and procedures. Determinations of that
Board shall be final.
   (B)   It is probable that not all possible situations for justifying
granting a credit and/or adjustment can be sufficiently proven and/or
anticipated and provided for in advance. Some inequities will occur. Unless
sufficient facts are either brought forward to establish eligibility for an
adjustment/credit under the express provisions of this chapter or upon clear
and convincing proof that fairness requires it (such as a city bookkeeping or
systems error or malfunction or an erroneous estimated reading), as reasonably
determined by the Board of Public Works and Safety, no billing credit or
adjustment shall be given by the city.
   (C)   An appeal of an initial determination to the Board of Public Works and
Safety may only be made after the customer has either (i) paid the disputed
amount in full, or (ii) executed a payment plan to repay the disputed amount.

   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The Department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security
measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements
to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Department ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Department shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The Department has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Department and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the Department reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
subchapter.
      (7)   If the Department has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Department may seek a
court order to access the premises.

practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute
to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters
of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at his, her or their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this subchapter. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.026 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or water of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Department in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Department within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.

STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 55.040 PURPOSE/INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce the hazard to public health and
safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff and to establish legal authority
to carry out all inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary
to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.041 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the city that would disturb 10,000 square feet or more of land area. The
Department, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the
requirement of controlled runoff for: (1) minor subdivisions and parcelization,
(2) sites with less than 5,000 square feet of impervious area, or (3)
agricultural zoned land, if the proposed development disturbed area is less
than one acre and is less than 5,000 square feet of total impervious surface.
Also exempt from the requirements of this subchapter shall be agricultural
land-disturbing activities associated with normal farming operations.
Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention requirements are
provided under §
55.042.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.042 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the
city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff
resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled
release of excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of
floodplain storage shall be required for all developments and redevelopments
located within the city. Release rate requirements, downstream restriction
considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property impact considerations,
policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion hazard corridors, and
compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards.
   (B)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the Department to discourage direct release of runoff from
a new development or redevelopment without providing detention. However, in
rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or
watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis) adopted by
the Department substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for
a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention
requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other special circumstances
when such a waiver may be considered by Department include situations where the
design of a regional pond has already taken into account the provision of
direct release in certain areas in the watershed.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 55.060 PURPOSE/INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the contribution of pollutants
to the storm drain system from construction site runoff and to establish legal
authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures
necessary to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.061 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The Department will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials
handling procedures, to be submitted as part of a project's construction plans
and specifications. Any project located within the corporate boundaries of the
city that includes clearing, grading, excavation or other land disturbing
activities resulting in the disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total
land area is subject to the requirements of this subchapter. This includes both
new development and re-development. This subchapter also applies to
disturbances of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or
sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or
more of total land area. §
55.063 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM's CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment control
measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (C)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the Department, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §
55.105, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site. For an individual lot where land disturbance is 10,000 square
feet or more but less than one acre, an individual lot plot plan permit
application is required prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the
permitting process are contained in §
55.105.
   (D)   An individual lot located within a larger permitted project site, is
considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot
operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit
approved for the larger project site. The stormwater permit application for the
larger project site must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures
for individual lots. In addition, the builders of these individual lots are
required to submit an individual lot plot plan permit application along with a
SWPPP for that individual lot prior to receiving a building permit and complete
a construction stormwater residential development registration form (State Form
53049) and maintain it onsite. A copy of this form is included in the city’s
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Details of the permitting process for
individual lots and parcels are contained in §
55.105 and additional requirements for individual lots may be found in the
city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (E)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the Department in accordance with §§
55.100 through
55.109. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the Department upon
completion of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a
termination inspection to be performed by the Department. However, all persons
engaging in construction and land disturbing activities on a permitted project
site meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements
of this chapter.
   (F)   Also exempt from the requirements of this subchapter shall be
agricultural land-disturbing activities associated with normal farming
operations.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.062 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
   (B)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit to
the Department, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as
well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction
sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be retained for at
least three years from the date the project permit is terminated. For land
disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less than one acre,
appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the
city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual must be designed and shown on the
plans.
   (C)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that apply
to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.063 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
   (A)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for example,
road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other utilities) to a
land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.
   (B)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project sites,
such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of one acre
of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the
lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.
   (C)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and the product guidance/specifications of the manufacturer. The methods and
procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above-
stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's CSGP. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained online through IDEM.
   (D)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.064 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit or individual
lot plot plan permit by the Department and commencement of construction
activities, the Department has the authority to conduct inspections of the site
to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved
stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual,
and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the Department, shall monitor
and manage project construction and stormwater activities. Details regarding
the required monitoring activities are contained in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
   (C)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this subchapter,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (D)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or in
the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 55.080 PURPOSE/INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the contribution of pollutants
to the storm drain system from post-construction runoff from new development
and re-development and to establish legal authority to carry out all
inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.081 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements noted in §§
55.060 through
55.064, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the Department as part of the stormwater management permit application, must
also include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation,
and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one acre
or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
This includes both new development and re-development, and disturbances of land
less than one acre of total land area that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one acre
or more of total land area. In addition, regardless of the amount of
disturbance, the Department reserves the right to require pre-treatment BMPs
for proposed hot spot developments in accordance with provisions contained in
the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to construction
activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less
than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale; or individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.
   (C)   The requirements under this subchapter do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the Department in accordance with §§
55.100 through
55.109. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMP's (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the Department upon completion of the project and stabilization of the
site, requesting a termination inspection to be performed by the Department.
However, all eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting
the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Also exempt from the requirements of this subchapter shall be
agricultural land-disturbing activities associated with normal farming
operations.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.082 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. Through the use
of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to treat the water quality
volume (WQv) or the water quality flow (Qwq), stormwater runoff will be
filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be
removed.
   (B)   It is also recognized that another major source of pollution in many
Indiana streams, including those within the corporate boundaries of the city,
is the streambank erosion associated with urbanizing watersheds. Stream
channels develop their shape in response to the volume and rate of runoff that
they receive from their contributing watersheds. Research has shown that in
hydrologically stable watersheds, the stream flow responsible for most of the
shaping of the channel (called the bankfull flow) occurs between every one to
two years. When land is developed, the volume and rate of runoff from that land
increases for these comparatively small flooding events that are not normally
addressed by the detention practices and the stream channel will adapt by
changing its shape. As the stream channel works to reach a new stable shape,
excess erosion occurs. As new development and re-development continues within
the corporate boundaries of the city, measures must be taken to minimize the
impact of such development or re-development on streambank erosion. Through the
use of appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to retain and/or detain and
slowly release the channel protection volume (CPv), the volume and rate of
runoff for channel forming flows will be reduced in an attempt to minimize
increased streambank erosion in the receiving streams and channels.
   (c)   The project site owner must submit to the department a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of appropriate BMP(s)
from a pre-approved list of BMP's specified in the city’s Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal shall include an operation and
maintenance manual for all post-construction BMP(s) included in the project and
a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with the sample agreement
provided in the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the
long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the
deed for the property on which the project is located. The noted BMP(s) must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. Practices other
than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the
burden of proof, as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMP's are provided in the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (D)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under "hot spots" provision in the Technical Standards) to
reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff.
These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities
that replace their tanks, regardless of the size of the facility.
   (E)   Discharges from new development and redevelopment sites will not be
allowed directly into karst features without pre-treatment.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.083 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines discussed

   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the city’s Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in the
referenced standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet or
exceed the requirements of IDEM's MS4GP.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.084 EASEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention
basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems,
conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-
of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of
monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, adequate easement
width, as detailed in the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, beyond
the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as
an access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be provided.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.085 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the
Department and the commencement of construction activities, the Department has
the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, the approved stormwater
pollution prevention plan, the city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual,
and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition,

specific project, a developer may submit conceptual drainage plans and
calculations for review by the Department. The direction provided by the
Department during such a review is based on preliminary data and shall not be
construed as an acceptance or binding on either party. The following is a
general listing of minimum data requirements for the review of conceptual
drainage plans:
      (1)   Two complete sets of conceptual plans showing general project
layout, including existing and proposed drainage systems (plan sheets must be
larger than 11 inches by 17 inches, but not to exceed 24 inches by 36 inches);
      (2)   General description of the existing and proposed drainage systems
in narrative form;
      (3)   Map showing on-site 100-year floodplain and floodway (please note
if none exists);
      (4)   Map showing all wetlands, lakes, and ponds on or adjacent to the
site;
      (5)   Watershed boundaries with USGS contours or best information
possible;
      (6)   Two copies of drainage calculations detailing existing and proposed
discharges from the site; and
      (7)   Existing watercourse or regulated drains.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.103 GENERAL PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the Department. The application will include a completed
application checklist, construction plan sheets, a stormwater drainage
technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other
necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the
application can be found in §
55.104. One copy of each application must be submitted to the Department. The
Department may, at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to
other entities deemed appropriate by the Department. Additionally, a digital
copy of the construction plans is required in a format accepted by the
Department.
   (B)   After the Department's receipt of the application, the applicant will
be notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the Department and/or its plan review consultant(s).
   (C)   Pursuant to IC 13-18-27, an MS4-designated entity or other review
authority such as SWCD (if applicable) must make a preliminary determination as
to whether the construction plan associated with SWPPP is substantially
complete before the end of the tenth working day (for sites with less than five
acres of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to the
review authority or the fourteenth working day (for sites with five acres or
larger of land disturbance) after the day on which the SWPPP is submitted to
the review authority. Note these time limits only apply to the SWPPP portion of
the overall stormwater permit submittal and does not affect any official or
non-official permit review timelines set by the entity for other aspects of the
stormwater permit application.
   (D)   Once all comments from all reviewers have been received and review
completed, the Department will either approve the project, request
modifications, or deny the project. If the applicant does not agree with or
accept the review findings and wishes to seek an appeal, the Department will
place the project on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
City Board of Public Works and Safety, provided the agenda for the meeting has
not yet been advertised or published. If time for notification does not allow,
the project shall be placed on the following regularly scheduled meeting of the
City Board of Public Works and Safety. If the project must go through a
scheduled meeting, the Department will furnish the applicant a complete list of
comments and objections to the plans and accompanying data prior to the
scheduled meeting. After the scheduled meeting, the Department will either
issue a permit, request modifications to the construction plans, or deny the
project.
   (E)   The project site owner must notify the Department and IDEM before
beginning construction. Notification to the Department shall be in the form of
an email while the notification to IDEM shall be in the form of an online IDEM
NOI submittal. Once a permit has been issued and the pending construction
notifications submitted to the Department and IDEM before the beginning of
construction, construction may commence 48 hours after the NOI is submitted to
IDEM. Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor construction
activities and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention measures in
compliance with this chapter and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit. Upon completion of construction activities, a certification of
completion and compliance and as-built plans must be submitted to the
Department.
   (F)   Once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed, a notification shall
be sent to the Department, requesting a termination inspection. The Department,
or its representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify that the
completed project is fully stabilized and meets the requirements of chapter and
the city Technical Standards and that the terms and conditions of the permit.
Once the applicant receives a signed copy of the termination inspection
checklist confirming compliance, they must forward a copy to IDEM along with
the required IDEM NOT form. Permits issued by the Department under this
scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is
not completed within five years, an updated permit application must be
submitted to the Department and an updated NOI must be resubmitted to IDEM at
least 90 days prior to expiration.

(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.108 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In granting a stormwater management permit, the Department may impose
such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of
this chapter. The project site owner shall insure compliance with such terms
and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and conditions of permits will be
subject to enforcement as described in §§
55.120 through
55.124 and §
55.999.
   (B)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the stormwater management permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
   (C)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or discharge
to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the Department
may require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality measures than
detailed in this chapter or in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.
   (D)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.
   (E)   Determination of impact drainage areas.
      (1)   The following areas shall be designated by default as impact
drainage areas unless good reason for not including them is presented to the
Department.
         (a)   A floodway or floodplain as designated by the most updated FEMA
Code dealing with floodplain regulation and/or by the best available data
through IDNR.
         (b)   Land within 25 feet of each bank of any ditch within the city's
system.
         (c)   Land within 15 feet of the centerline of any stormwater
infrastructure or enclosed conduit within the city's system.
         (d)   Land within 75 feet of each bank of a county open regulated
drain.
         (e)   Land within 50 feet of a natural drainageway.
         (f)   Land within 75 feet of the centerline of any tiled regulated
drain.
         (g)   Land within the fluvial erosion hazard (FEH) corridor.
         (h)   Land within the expected breach inundation zone of an existing
or proposed new dam, and areas protected from flooding by a levee.
      (2)   The Department is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact
drainage areas, the Department may consider such factors as topography, soil
type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage
facility.
      (3)   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the Department. Special terms and conditions for
development within any impact drainage area shall be included in the stormwater
management permit.
   (F)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The Department is authorized, but is not required, to classify
certain geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or will be
served by regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases, an
infrastructure development fee (IDF) rate may be established for the designated
drainage area. The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed development
or re-development within a designated drainage area will be as detailed in the
city’s Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.109 CERTIFICATION OF AS-BUILT PLANS.
   (A)   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the Department or
retained privately. After completion of construction of the project and before
the release of required performance assurances referenced in §
55.108, a professionally prepared and certified as-built set of plans (record
drawings) shall be submitted to the Department for review. These as-built
plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the Engineer of Record,
i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the construction plans.
Additionally, a digital copy of the as-built plans (record drawings) as well as
finalized digital versions of all analyses, models, manuals, and reports that
are consistent with the as-built conditions is required in a format acceptable
to the Department. These plans shall include all pertinent data relevant to the
completed storm drainage system and stormwater management facilities, and shall
include:
      (1)   Pipe size and pipe material;
      (2)   Invert elevations;
      (3)   Top rim elevations;

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 55.120 PURPOSE/INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to set the compliance, enforcement, and
penalties associated with the requirements and regulations discussed in this
chapter.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.121 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   This subchapter applies to any action or inaction which violates the
provisions of this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater
management design plan or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded
stormwater maintenance agreement.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.122 COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   To secure compliance with the requirements of this chapter, violations
thereof shall be subject to the enforcement provisions set forth under §
55.999. Additionally, compliance with all applicable ordinances of the city as
well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and regulations shall also be
required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this
chapter shall be the most recent edition available.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the Department finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, the Department may serve upon that person a written warning
notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and
requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a
resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or
resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves
the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this subchapter shall limit the
authority of the Department to take any action, including emergency action or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.123 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (A)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the Department may, after giving notice
and opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the owner
shall be required to promptly reimburse the Department for all costs of such
work.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Department from taking such
other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the stormwater drainage
system made necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties levied by
the EPA or IDEM for violation of the city’s NPDES permit, administrative costs,
attorney fees, court costs, and other costs and expenses associated with the
enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
   (C)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the Department or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the Department may commence
a court action to recover the costs assessed under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be read
together with IC 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4).
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.124 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the Board of Public Works
and Safety of the city the action or decision whereby any such provision was so
applied. Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis
for the appeal. The Board of Public Works and Safety of the city shall consider
the appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the
action being appealed. In considering any such appeal, the Board of Public
Works and Safety of the city may consider the recommendations of the Department
Staff and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In
considering any such appeal, the Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a
variance from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part,
from the action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following
requirements are satisfied:
      (1)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
the chapter; and
      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective management
of stormwater runoff.
      (3)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the Board of Public
Works and Safety may appeal an adverse decision of the Board to the Huntington
County Court within 60 days of the Boards order, all pursuant to IC 36-1-6-9(e)
and (f).
   (B)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the Board of
Public Works and Safety upholding the decision of the Department, then
representatives of the Department shall enter upon the subject private property
and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property, including the commencing of a court
action under IC 34-28-5-1(b),to be read together with IC 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and
13-21-3-12(4), to enforce the order of the Board of Public Works and Safety.
(Ord. 24-C-24, passed 12-10-24)
§ 55.999 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Notice of violation/citation.
      (1)   If the Department determines that an applicant or other responsible
person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an
approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater management
maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it may issue a
written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person and
the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by
this chapter without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of
violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of
the activity being conducted on the site.
      (2)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
   (B)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the Department may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, public education, etc.
   (C)   Civil penalties for violations.
      (1)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a
civil infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues
without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the Department may be
deemed a separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the imposition
of a fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this subchapter
are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. An
admission or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this subchapter.
      (3)   The Department has established an enforcement response schedule as
noted in the table below that standardizes the approach that the Department
may, in its discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater regulations offenses
subject to this chapter and the associated technical standards document. When
so employed, this schedule shall apply separately to each offense in the
following manner: The first offense is the underlying violation itself, while
the subsequent offenses two through six (as necessary) are failures of
compliance.
 
Offense #      Type of Response Anticipated
First offense  Verbal telephone notice, letter of violation or written warning
               and administrative penalty
Second offense Letter of violation, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Third offense  Agreed order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fourth offense Administrative order, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Fifth offense  Compliance schedule, administrative penalty and/or site visit
Sixth offense  Litigation and administrative penalty
 
      (4)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the Department
may, in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative penalties,
the Department has established the following schedule of administrative
penalties. Again, the penalty for the first offense would apply to the
violation itself, while the subsequent penalties two through four (as
necessary) would apply to failures of compliance. In its discretion, the
Department may impose penalties up to the amount specified in this schedule.
 
Offense #      Penalty
First offense  $250
Second offense $500
Third offense  $1,000
Fourth offense $2,500
 
   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the Department may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the Department to proceed with the work. A stop work order will
be posted on the site by the Department and it is unlawful for any person to
remove the notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the
Department. The Department may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this
chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost
of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person
carrying out or participating in the work.
      (2)   The Department may bring an action under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be
read together with IC 34-6-2-86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work
order against any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order.
      (3)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP approved
by the Department, if a stop work order is issued on the grounds that the
erosion and sediment control measures included in the construction plan are not
adequate, the project site owner must be notified in writing of the
inadequacies in the erosion and sediment control measures and the project site
owner has 72 hours after receiving written notice to resolve the identified
inadequacies before the stop work order can take effect.
      (4)   The 72 hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the stop work order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The Department may request the
Building Commissioner refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the
building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site
until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures
set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise satisfied the
requirements of this chapter as determined by the Department.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The Department may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the Department may deem necessary to enable the applicant or
other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the Department finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that
the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the Department may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance
requirements and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this chapter shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the Department may commence court action
against such person under IC 34-28-5-1(b), to be read together with IC 34-6-2-
86(1)B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce a stop work order.
         (c)   The Department may allow the person to recommence its discharge
when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Department within five days of receipt of the emergency
order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
   (H)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Department may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Department
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to
persons.
   (I)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Department will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access.
The violator may petition the Department for a reconsideration and hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this chapter, without the prior
approval of the Department.

§ 56.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Huntington ("city"), through the
regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system, to the
maximum extent practicable as required by applicable authority. This chapter
establishes particular requirements for controlling the introduction of
pollutants into the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (“MS4"), in
compliance with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (“NPSES”) permit process. The objectives of this chapter include:
   (A)   Regulating the contribution of pollutants to the Municipal Separate

or facilities which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner
or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at that
owner's own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses, through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. By
way of example, these establishments include but are not limited to: impervious
surfaces, retail gasoline outlets; or municipal, state, federal or
institutional refueling areas. Further, any person responsible for a property
or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPSES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this
section. These BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPP) as the city determines to be necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPSES permit.
(Ord. 22-C-04, passed 11-9-04)

   Every person owning and/or occupying property through which a watercourse
passes shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property
free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would or
would probably pollute, contaminate, or significantly impede the flow of water
through the watercourse. If herbicides are used for vegetation control, such
herbicides shall be compatible with, and registered and approved by, all
appropriate authority for use in and around watercourses. In addition, the
owner or occupant shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or
adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard or
impediment to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 22-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 56.15 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of any
spill, said person shall notify the city, in person or by phone or facsimile,
no later than the next business day. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site, detailed written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained and made available for inspection and copying, upon demand by
the city, for at least three years from date of record creation.

§ 59.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction by:
minimizing increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to
reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion; minimizing increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
minimizing the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and reducing
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety. The City of Huntington has produced a Stormwater
Development Manual particularizing aspects of the overall plan to achieve the
purpose stated above. Two copies of the current version of that manual are on
file with and available for examination and coping at the office of the city's
Clerk-Treasurer during normal business hours.

Guide of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services” and the “Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual,” published by IDNR.
(Ord. 19-C-05, passed 11-29-05)
§ 59.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   All applicants shall develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan.
The plan must include: a description of potential pollutant sources from the
proposed land use, that may reasonably be expected to add a significant amount
of pollutants to stormwater discharge; location, dimensions, detailed
specifications, and construction details of all post construction stormwater
quality measures; a description of measures that will be installed to control
pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction
activities have been completed; a sequence describing when each post
construction stormwater quality measure will be installed; and a narrative
description of the maintenance guidelines for all post construction stormwater
quality measures to facilitate their proper long term function.
   (B)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize swales and natural depressions as site conditions allow,
utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater
runoff generated from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (C)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the city. In no case shall the impact on functional values
be any less than then allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).
   (D)   All sites shall preserve buffer strips and riparian zones, create
filter strips, minimize land disturbance, minimize surface imperviousness,
minimize directly connected impervious areas, maximize open space, direct
growth away from sensitive areas and toward areas that can support it without
compromising water quality, and have storage and infiltration in any
combination, where appropriate to reduce the impact of pollutants in stormwater
run-off.
   (E)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas.
   (F)   Discharges from an MS4 area will not be allowed directly into
sinkholes or fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge
meeting Indiana ground water quality standards as then referenced in 327 IAC 2-
11.
   (G)   Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must ensure
that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground water quality
standards as then referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
   (H)   As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through the
MS4 conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream bank
erosion. Where appropriate, channel protection shall be provided to protect
stream channels from degradation.
   (I)   As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of appropriate
width shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches.
   (J)   New retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal, or
institutional refueling areas, or outlets and refueling areas that replace
their existing tank systems shall be required to design and install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff.
   (K)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., wellhead protection areas, cold water fisheries, swimming beaches,
recreational waters, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to
additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain
stormwater management practices.
   (L)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan in accordance with 327 IAC 15-6, and shall
file a notice of intent (N01) under the provisions of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPSES) general permit. The Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (M)   Hotspots may require the use of specific structural stormwater
treatment practices and pollution prevention practices, as determined by city,
in its reasonable discretion .
(Ord. 19-C-05, passed 11-29-05)
§ 59.10 MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL MEASURES.
   (A) Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has an
stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site shall execute a maintenance agreement, that can
be found in the city's Stormwater Development Manual. That agreement shall be
binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management
facility. The agreement shall provide an easement for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or its contractor or
agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that
the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards
and any other provisions established by this chapter. The maintenance agreement
shall be recorded by the city in the land records.
   (B)   Maintenance agreement. Maintenance of all stormwater management
facilities shall be ensured through the creation of the maintenance agreement.
For residential and non-residential subdivisions, a stormwater provision shall
be included in the subdivision covenants that shall be approved by the city
prior to final plat approval, and recorded into the land record as the last
component of final plan approval. As part of the covenants, a schedule shall be
developed by the owner with the city's approval for when and how often
maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management
facility. The covenants shall also include plans for periodic inspections to
ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
   (C)   Requirements for maintenance agreement. All stormwater management
facilities shall undergo, at a, minimum, an annual inspection by the
responsible party, and may undergo periodic inspections by city as well, and
that responsible party's inspection shall document maintenance and repair needs
and ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment
of its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other
debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and
vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. A
complete written copy of that responsible party's inspection shall be furnished
to city and any maintenance needs found shall be addressed in a timely manner,
as determined by the city, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may
be increased as deemed by city to be appropriate to ensure proper functioning
of the stormwater management facility.
   (D)   Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses
to meet the requirements of that maintenance agreement inspection and follow-
up, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all reasonably appropriate work to
place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the
stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public
health, the city shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the
stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, that
party shall have three days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in
a city-approved manner. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s)
of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of
the work shall be a lien on the property, or assessed against the beneficial
users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as
ordinary taxes by the county for the benefit of the city to the full extent
permitted by applicable authority.

available to city.
   (B)   Post construction inspection.
      (1)   Reasonable inspection programs may be established by city,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations;
inspection of drainage basins or areas identified by city as higher sources of
sediment contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of
a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or
pollutants or with discharges of a type which are likely to cause violations of
state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPSES stormwater
permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
treatment practices.
      (2)   Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all
operational activities. Such a “cease and desist order” will be in effect until
the city confirms that the operational activity is in compliance and the
violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of
violation in a timely manner can result in civil or monetary penalties in
accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter.
   (C)   Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the city shall have the right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This
includes the right to enter a property when city has a reasonable basis to
believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring or has occurred, and to
enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a
violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-C-05, passed 11-29-05)
§ 59.13 PROPER CREDENTIALS REQUIRED.

activities should be planned among all persons involved with a site.
   (A)   Prior to final land grading, seeding, and mulching, the person holding
the permit shall petition the city, in writing, to provide an opportunity for
the installation of any remaining utility lines on the site. Those persons
involved in the installation of utility lines shall perform their work
reasonably promptly to minimize the time period during which some of the land
may be in a relatively unprotected state. After the utility lines have been
installed, the person holding the permit shall promptly complete all stormwater
management activities.
   (B)   When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit shall
petition, in writing, the city for approval of stormwater management measures
which are to remain on the site to evaluate the adequacy of these control
measures. “As built” drawings shall be submitted with that petition.

bonds and/or letters of credit shall be released and maintenance
responsibilities (see §
59.10) shall remain with the person owning the land.
      (2)   If the stormwater management measures are not approved because they
are not in compliance with either the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan or
the requirements of this chapter, the city shall notify, in writing, the person
holding the permit of unacceptable features. After corrective measures are
taken, a petition, again in writing, may be filed asking the city to evaluate
the adequacy of the stormwater management measures. If, in good faith, the city
again decides that the stormwater management measures are inadequate, the city
may delay the release of any performance bonds and/or letters of credit and the
city may use the performance bond to finance changes or additions to the
stormwater management measures needed to complete the project.

violate, any provision of this chapter, the city may impose an administrative
fine against such person in an amount not to exceed $1,000 on a per violation,
per day basis, plus any administrative or remediation costs.
         (b)   Imposition of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.
      (6)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter also may be enforced
by injunction.
   (B)   Cease and desist orders. When the city finds that a person has
violated, or continues to violate, or that the person's past violations are
likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the person directing the person
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the person to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
reasonable to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

The total amount, including any accrued interest, shall be collected in the
same manner as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to the

subsequent owner. If the property is conveyed before the lien is recorded, the
city shall notify the person who owned the property at the time the fee became
payable. The notice must inform the person that payment, including penalty fees

to remove same in order to carry out any plan of street, sidewalk, utility or
curb improvement adopted by the city.

limbs and branches of any vegetation to be and remain over and above: (1) any
sidewalk to a distance of less than eight feet above the surface of a sidewalk,
or (2) any street to a distance of less than ten feet above the surface of a

cropped and trimmed in compliance with this section on being notified in
writing by the city to do so, or upon the property owner’s initiative upon
obtaining a permit to do so, excepting only incidental cropping or trimming for
which no such permit shall be required. It is further the duty of an adjacent
property owner to provide care for such trees sufficient to keep them, or parts
of them, from becoming a nuisance, or hazard to the public health, welfare,
and/or safety on the property owner’s initiative, excepting, however, that this
responsibility does not eliminate the need for permits otherwise required by
this Code or other applicable authority.
   (B)   Whenever any vegetation is found not to be in compliance with the
provisions of sub-section (A), the Director of Public Works and Engineering or
his designee shall give the property owner written notice to trim such
vegetation within five days of receipt of the notice, and on failure of the
owner to do so then the Director of Public Works and Engineering or his
designee may cause the vegetation to be trimmed and the cost of the work shall
be charged to the owner. If within 30 days of billing, the owner fails to pay
those charges, then the city may file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction
to collect the amount due for that work.

§ 115.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose and object of this chapter to regulate
sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals,
and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration
of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the case of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to,
Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the
Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually
Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immuno deficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS),
genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immuno
deficiency virus (HIV) in the United States -- 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   As of January 1, 1998, there have been 4,901 reported cases of AIDS
in the State of Indiana.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV anti-body test in the
State of Indiana.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films.
      (16)   The finding noted in paragraphs (1) through (15%)raise substantial
governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens o the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

§ 150.08 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   No change or expansion of use, or of occupancy, of any existing or
newly constructed building or structure shall take place without a certificate
of occupancy issued by the Department. This provision shall not apply to
changes in occupancy that relate only to ownership or possession rights and do
not otherwise affect usage, but does apply to changes in leasable tenant
spaces.
   (B)   A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period not
exceeding six months upon a determination by the Building Commissioner that a
need exists and there is no immediate danger to the public health, safety, and
welfare. The Building Commissioner may impose reasonable conditions as a part
of the temporary approval. Reasonable conditions shall include only those
requirements of applicable law which have not been completed by the permittee
and/or property owner when a certificate of occupancy is requested.
   (C)   If a building permit has been issued in connection with a change
covered by this chapter, no additional fee shall be assessed for the
certificate of occupancy. If no permit is required for the change, no fee shall
be assessed for the certificate of occupancy. Should a change which requires a
certificate of occupancy occur without a certificate of occupancy being issued,
the Department may assess a penalty of $15.
   (D)   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued except after compliance
with all applicable state and local law as determined by the Building
Commissioner after required inspections.

§ 158.036 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (A)   A nonconforming use which occupies a portion of a structure or
premises may be extended within that structure or premises as they existed when
the prohibitory provisions took effect, but not in violation of the area and
yard requirements of the district in which the structure or premises are
located. No change of a nonconforming use shall entail structural alterations
or any additions other than those required by law for the purpose of safety and
health.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose any conditions as it deems
necessary for the protection of adjacent property and the public interest.
   (C)   No nonconforming structure or use shall be changed to another
nonconforming use without approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (D)   In the event that any nonconforming use, conducted in a structure or
otherwise, ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of one year, that
nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
   (E)   Subject to §
158.049, any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood, or other casualty
may be reconstructed and used as before if the reconstruction is performed
within 12 months of the casualty, and if the restored structure has no greater
coverage and contains no greater cubic content than before the casualty.
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the reconstruction, repair, or
rebuilding of a nonconforming structure or part thereof existing at the
effective date of this chapter, rendered necessary by wear and tear,
deterioration, or depreciation provided the cost of such work shall not exceed
50% of the assessed value of the structure at the time work is done, nor
prevent compliance with the provisions of the One and Two Family Dwelling Code
relative to the maintenance of buildings or structures.
   (G)   (1) Within one year of the effective date of this chapter, all
existing junkyards must be screened and surrounded by a solid, continuous fence
or wall of at least eight feet in height to screen enclosed contents from
public view.
      (2)   In the event that a site cannot obtain screening due to conflict
with the fencing regulations in Chapter 152, that site shall then be deemed a
public nuisance and will be subject to any provisions requested by the Plan
Director for the removal of all junk from the site.
      (3)   The Plan Director shall have the authority to promulgate rules and
regulations governing the location, planting, construction, and maintenance of
all materials used for the required screening of those junkyards.
      (4)   No junkyard shall be established within 75 feet from any
residential zone.
   (H)   A non-conforming structure may be enlarged and expanded if all of the
following requirements are adhered to:
      (1)   The addition shall not extend into any required front yard beyond
the existing structure.
      (2)   The addition shall not extend into any required side yard beyond
the existing structure.
      (3)   The addition shall not extend into any required rear yard beyond
the existing structure.
      (4)   The addition shall not extend any closer to an intersection of
streets or other rights-of-way than the existing structure.
      (5)   The addition may extend beyond the existing structure only when
said addition meets all required setbacks and regulations of this chapter.
   (I)   Governmental acquisition. Any legally established building, structure,
sign, or portions thereof, which either becomes non- conforming or increases
the extent of non-conformity as a result of the acquisition of land for right-
or-way or other purposes by a governmental entity, subdivision or agency shall
be subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Buildings or structures. Any building or structure which becomes
non-conforming or increases the extent of non- conformity as to setbacks as a
result of a governmental acquisition may continue to be used or occupied
provided the building or structure maintain compliance with all other
applicable health, safety and building codes.
      (2)   Casualty. Any building or structure which becomes non- conforming
or increases the extent of non-conformity as to setbacks as a result of a
governmental acquisition which is subsequently damaged by fire, flood, or other
casualty may be reconstructed and used as before if the reconstruction is
performed within 12 months of the casualty, and if the restored structure has
no greater coverage and contains no greater cubic content than before the
casualty.
      (3)   Enlargement or expansion. Any building or structure which becomes
non-conforming or increases the extent of non- conformity as to setbacks as a
result of a governmental acquisition may subsequently be enlarged or expanded
as long as the enlarged or expanded portion of the building or structure meets
all applicable setback requirements in the zone the building or structure is
located.
      (4)   Signs. Any legally established sign which becomes non- conforming
or increases the extent of non-conformity as to setbacks as a result of a
governmental acquisition may continue to be used provided that no portion of
the sign encroaches into any public right-of-way, interferes with the stated
purpose of the governmental agency's acquisition, or otherwise creates a safety
hazard.
      (5)   Lot area. Any lot or parcel which becomes non- conforming or
increases the extent of non-conformity as to minimum lot area as a result of a
governmental acquisition may continue to be used or occupied provided that
other applicable requirements of this code are met.

   (B)   For uses not specified in this section or in that instance when the
requirement for an adequate number of spaces is unclear, the number of parking
spaces shall be determined by the administrative official, on the basis of
similar requirements, the number of persons served or employed, and the
capability of adequately serving the visiting public. The determination may be
reviewed by the Commission or appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (C) All land used for off-street parking, except for any one- or two-family
dwelling unit, shall be landscaped to aid in controlling the circulation of
cars and pedestrians, to identify entrances and exits, and to improve the
appearance of the use to maintain property values in the area and by adhering
to the following requirements contained herein.
      (l) All open, off-street parking areas shall maintain shade trees of a
variety to this region and totaling an amount of mature tree canopy equal to
not less than l% of the surfaced parking area. The minimum size tree island
shall not be less than 70 square feet.
      (2) Screening, consisting of a hedge, wall, or uniformly painted fence to
provide a visual separator and physical barrier, with maximum height of three
feet, shall be provided between the off-street parking and all adjacent
residential and business areas. Those lots adjacent to a residential district
shall provide screening between that land and the residential district not less
than six feet in height.
      (3) The total landscaped area for any parking lot or development shall
not be less than 10% of the gross area of impervious surface. The owner shall
be responsible for the perpetual maintenance of the green space. Landscaping
shall consist of a combination of living vegetation such as trees, shrubs and
grasses or ground cover materials. Existing preserved natural vegetation areas
that are to remain after the development shall count towards satisfying this
requirement. Loose stone, rock or gravel may be used as a landscaping accent,
but it shall not exceed 20% of the required landscaping area.
   (D) Setbacks. All land used for off-street parking in districts for which
front yards are required by this section, shall be located not less than five
feet from any property line abutting a street; provided that nothing in this
division shall be deemed to apply to any off-street parking space or driveway
thereto for any single-family or two-family dwelling unit.
   (E)   Curbing. All parking lots shall have curbings around perimeters at a
sufficient location to keep vehicles from overhanging or encroaching upon
abutting properties, streets, alleys, or sidewalks. Curbings are also to be
used to facilitate drainage and insure discharge of water onto abutting
properties.
   (F) Lighting. Any light used to illuminate land used for off-street parking,
or driveways thereto, shall be installed on private property and maintained so
as to reflect the light away from any adjoining property. It shall also be
designed to avoid glare into street rights-of-way.
   (G) Minimum design standards for parking lots. All off-street parking areas
must meet the following minimum design standards:
   (1)            Drives and Service Areas      Parking Only
      Surfaces         (Inches)           (Inches)
      Concrete          8             6

§ 158.044 PLANNED UNIT PROJECTS.
   The district regulations of this chapter may be modified by the Board of
Zoning Appeals in the case of a plan utilizing an unusual concept of
development which meets the requirements of this section. The planned unit
projects provision is intended to encourage original and imaginative
development and subdivision design which preserves the natural amenities of the
site and provides for the general welfare of the city. After the unit plan is
approved, all development, construction, and all use shall be in accordance
with that plan unless a new planned unit project plan is submitted to and
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals as required by this chapter. Any
development contrary to the approved unit plan shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
   (A)   The area of land to be developed shall not be less than five acres.
   (B)   Properties adjacent to the unit plan shall not be adversely affected.
   (C)   In planned unit residential projects, the minimum lot yard
requirements may be reduced; however, the average density of dwelling units in
the total unit plan shall not be higher than that permitted in the district in
which the plan is located.
   (D)   In planned unit business and industrial projects, the minimum lot and
yard requirements may be reduced; however, the total land area of the unit plan
shall equal the accumulative lot area requirements of each use or structure
contained within the unit plan.
   (E)   The unit plan shall permanently reserve land suitable for the common
use of the public or the owners in a particular development. This may be
accomplished by dedication, covenant, or easement. This land may be for future
public facilities, for recreational or scenic open space, or for a landscaped
buffer zone as approved by the Plan Commission. Provisions for permanent
control and maintenance of this land shall be outlined in a form acceptable to
the Plan Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (F)   The use of the land shall not differ substantially from the uses
permitted in the district in which the plan is located, except that limited
business facilities, intended to serve only the planned unit residential
project area and fully integrated into the design of the project, may be
considered and multiple-family dwellings may be considered in single-family
residential districts if they are so designed and sited that they do not
detract from the character of the neighborhood in which they occur.
   (G)   The unit plan shall be consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
   (H)   The unit plan shall be reviewed, and recommendations made, by the City
Plan Commission to determine if the proposed project is consistent with the
City Comprehensive Plan and in the best interest of the city.

§ 158.046 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of this section to
provide for certain types of home occupations to be conducted within a dwelling
unit or accessory structure on the resident's premises. Two classes of home
occupations are established, based upon the type and intensity of the home
occupation. Accordingly, minimum standards have been established for each class
of home occupation in order to assure the compatibility of home occupations
with other uses permitted in the applicable district, and to preserve the
character of residential neighborhoods.
   (B)   Home occupations shall not be permitted except in compliance with
Chapter 158 and other applicable law.
   (C)   Application for home occupation. An application for an administrative
permit for a type I home occupation or special exception permit for a type II
home occupation shall be signed by all owners and adult residents of the
property in question and filed with the Department on forms provided by the
Department. The Director shall review the application and classify the proposed
home occupation as a type I or type II based upon:
      (1)   The established standards for type I and type II home occupations
described in division (D) and (E); and
      (2)   General planning and zoning standards established by the Zoning
Code.

subject premises named in the application may be engaged in such home
occupation.
         (b)   No more than 25% of the total gross floor area of the dwelling
unit shall be used for such home occupation. The home occupation may not
utilize more than 50% of any one floor of the dwelling unit.
         (c)   No outdoor storage or display of products, equipment or
merchandise is permitted.
         (d)   Retail sales are permitted only as an accessory use to the
primary home occupation (that is, a beauty salon can sell shampoo and beauty
products).

§ 158.049 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION.
   (A)   Statutory authority, findings of fact, purpose and methods.
      (1)   Statutory authority. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Huntington does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
      (2)   Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
      (3)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
         (a)   Protect human life and health;
         (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
         (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight area;
         (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
         (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
         (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
         (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
         (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
         (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (4)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its
purposes, these regulations include methods and provisions for:
         (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
         (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
         (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
         (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers,
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
   (B)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have
in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      (3)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally
dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited
along the path of the current.
   “Flood or flooding” also includes the collapse or subsidence of land along
the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   "FLOOD HAZARD AREA." Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood. (See
"Special Flood Hazard Area").
   "FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)." An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   "FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS)." The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   "FLOOD PRONE AREA." Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See "Floodplain").
   "FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG)." The BFE plus three feet at any given
location in the SFHA. (See "Freeboard").
   "FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA." Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. (See "Flood")

where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS." Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   "FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING)." A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is wateftight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   "FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE." A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating stmctures to or above the
FPG.
   "FLOODWAY." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   "FREEBOARD." A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   "FRINGE" or "FLOOD FRINGE." The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   "FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE." A use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The

the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
   "HARDSHIP." (as related to variances of this section). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
city Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   "HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE." The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   "HISTORIC STRUCTURE." Any structure that is:

states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by:
         (a)   An approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved
programs.
   "HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS." Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   "INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT." A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   "LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LED)." A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incolporated an automatic adoption clause.
   "LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC)." A general term used to the several types of
revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   "CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR)." FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   "CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F)." A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   "LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA)." An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or land is not
located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A
LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   "LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS)." An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR)." An official revision to the
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      (6)   "LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F)." FEMA's
modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill
outside the existing regulatory floodway.
   "LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE." The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   "LOWEST FLOOR." (for floodplain management purposes). The lowest elevation
described among the following:

      (1)   Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the zoning jurisdiction of the
City of Huntington, Indiana as identified in §
158.049(C)(2), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed
by the city.
      (2)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
         (a)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an "AE
Zone" on the Huntington County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated June 2, 2015 shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Huntington County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated
June 2, 2015 as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
Should the floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
for a studied SFHA designated as an "AE Zone", the limits of the floodway will
be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
         (b)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an "A
Zone" on the Huntington County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map, dated June 2, 2015, as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
         (c)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
         (d)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LED), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
section prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard. Upon payment in accordance with §
158.107(G), a floodplain development permit shall be valid for a period not
exceeding two years from the date of issuance.
      (4)   Compliance.
         (a)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this section and other applicable regulations.
         (b)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this section
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
         (c)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (6)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
         (a)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine
Zone AE) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided
on the profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
         (b)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
         (c)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
      (7)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section, all provisions shall be:
         (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
         (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;
and
         (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (8)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this section does not create any liability on the part of the city,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this section, or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
      (9)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this section. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for
the city. All violations shall be punishable in accordance with §
158.202.
         (a)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
         (b)   The city Community Development and Redevelopment Department
shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood
insurance policy to be suspended.
         (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (D)   Administration.

floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the following map
maintenance activities are identified:
         (a)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
            1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months
of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
               a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
               c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts, and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
            2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal

provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online Letter of Map
Change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
            3.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional
letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit
for proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
            4.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
         (b)   Right to submit new technical data.
            1.   The Floodplain Administrator may request changes to any of the
information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or
floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric
details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation
made in writing by the Mayor and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
         (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the Huntington County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the city
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the city
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the city has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      (6)   Variance procedures.
         (a)   The city Board of Zoning Appeals (the board) as established by
the Common Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from requirements of this section.
         (b)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this section. Any person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the
Huntington County Circuit or Superior Courts.
         (c)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
divisions of this section, and:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            6.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            7.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            8.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            9.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and,
            10.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         (d)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance by the applicant.
         (e)   Variances from the provisions of this section shall only be
granted when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence
submitted at the hearing for the following:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship as defined in §
158.049(B); and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
         (f)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
158.049(E)(1)(a), §
158.049(E)(1)(c)1. or §
158.049(E)(1)(d) may be granted.
         (g)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
158.049(E)(1)(a), §
158.049(E)(1)(c) or §
158.049(E)(1)(d) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
         (h)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
158.049(E) may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
         (i)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
         (j)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
         (k)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (l)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this section, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section.
         (m)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
         (n)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
   (E)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
      (1)   Floodplain status standards.
         (a)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
158.049(C)(2) are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving undertaken before the actual
start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions to the
requirements of the Flood Control Act (IC 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may apply to
qualified additions/ improvements to existing lawful residential structures,
rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line crossings,
outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
            1.   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
158.049(C)(2), the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to
forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for
construction in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a
general license or exemption (IC 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this section.
            3.   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
            4.   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and
meeting requirements of §
158.049(D)(5)(a). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
            5.   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as
an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
            6.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
         (b)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either
identified on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a
FIRM), the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development
permit provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
         (c)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
            1.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:
               a.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits
of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
               b.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(approval for construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence
of general license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended
flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
               c.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
            2.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square
mile:
               a.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits
of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
               b.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
         (d)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
            1.   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the l% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following provisions are required:
         (a)   All new construction, reconstruction or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure, and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
         (b)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constmcted with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below
the FPG;
         (c)   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         (d)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG;
         (e)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         (f)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         (g)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
         (h)   Any alteration, repair, reconstmction, or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this section shall meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this section;
         (i)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres;
         (j)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this section
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
         (k)   Fill projects that do not involve a structure must be protected
against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk
heading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than 3feet
horizontal to l foot vertical.
         (l)   Non-conversion agreements shall be required for all new or
substantially improved elevated structures with an enclosure beneath the
elevated floor, accessory structures, and opensided shelters. The non-
conversion agreement shall run with the property, be binding upon subsequent
owners and recorded in the chain of title by the owner in the office of the
Recorder of Huntington County, Indiana. Properties covered by such agreements
shall be subject to periodic inspection by the city to verify compliance.
         (m)   Construction of new solid waste disposal facilities, hazard
waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities
shall not be permitted in areas of special flood hazard; and
         (n)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of
excavation taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal
to the volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of 1 to 1) due to the fill or
structure.
            l.   The excavation shall take place in the same floodplain on the
same property on which the authorized fill or structure is located, provided
sufficient space exists. If sufficient space does not exist on the same
property, the excavation shall take place in the same floodplain no further
than 1,000 feet from the site of the authorized fill or structure, provided
authorization/permission has been granted by the owners of any property where
the excavation is proposed.
            2.   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled.
            3.   The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater
but shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater.
            4.   The excavation shall be sufficiently stabilized and compacted
to remain firm and resist erosion.
            5.   A restrictive covenant which states the approved compensatory
cut area (excavation) shall not be altered without approval from the Floodplain
Administrator shall be executed and recorded in the County Recorder's Office
that runs with the property.
            6.   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way
leading to the floodplain.
            7.   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater.
            8.   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement. When a structure is placed on fill it
shall follow additional requirements of §
158.049(E)(3)(b)4. and §
158.049(E)(3)(c)4.
            9.   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of constiuction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
this section.
      (3)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data or flood depths have been provided, as set forth in §
158.049(C)(2), the following provisions are required:
         (a)   Building protection requirement. In addition to the general
standards described in §
158.049(E)(2), structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from

the existing structure (excluding the value of the land). An addition and/or
improvement project that is continuous in scope or time is considered as one
project for permitting purposes;
            4.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where
the costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred (the costs of any proposed additions or
improvements beyond restoring the damaged structure to its before damaged
condition must be included in the cost);
            5.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site;
            6.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site

structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take
into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures,
and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
               b.   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
            6.   A nonresidential structure may be constructed using a stem
wall foundation (also called chain wall, raised-slab-on-grade, and slab-on-
stem-wall-with-fill). Any backfilled stem wall foundation must be backfilled
with compacted structural fill, concrete, or gravel that supports the floor
slab. No flood openings are required for this type of construction.
         (d)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
            1.   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be
placed on a site in the SFHA:
               a.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent

vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way
endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft
intending to use or using the airport.
(Ord. 50-C-90, passed 2-12-91)
§ 158.055 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this
subchapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure not conforming to the regulations as the
effective date of this subchapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance
of a nonconforming structure. Nothing contained herein shall require any change
in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction, alteration of which was granted all necessary and appropriate
permits from regulatory authorities and was began prior to the effective date
of this subchapter, and is diligently pursued.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure is hereby required
to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Board of Aviation Commissioners
to indicate its presence, at the expense of the city.
(Ord. 50-C-90, passed 2-12-91)
§ 158.056 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. No structure shall be erected, enlarged or established in
excess of the applicable height limitation set forth in §
158.053(I) in any zone created under this subchapter, unless a height permit
has been applied for and granted by the Department. Each application for a
height permit shall indicate the purpose for which the height permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to allow the Department to determine
whether the resulting structure conforms to the regulations herein prescribed.
If such determination is in the affirmative, the height permit shall be
granted. No height permit shall be granted if the structure's proposed height
is inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, unless a height
variance has been approved in accordance with division (E) below.
   (B)   Height permits. Applications for height permits required by this
section shall be submitted to the Department on forms published for that
purpose. The Department shall promptly notify the Board of Aviation
Commissioners or its designee of any and all applications for height permits
filed under this section for the purpose of obtaining technical advice
concerning the aeronautical effects that the proposed structure will have on
air traffic and safety. The Board shall have ten days after notification in
which to review and comment on the height permit application.
   (C)   Existing uses. No height permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or allow a nonconforming use or
structure to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the
effective date of this subchapter or any amendment thereto or than it was when
the application for a height permit is made.
   (D)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever a nonconforming
structure has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no height permit shall be granted that would allow
such structure to be repaired, rebuilt or reconstructed in a manner which
exceeds the applicable height limit, without first obtaining a height variance.
   (E)   Height variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height
of any structure, or use property not in accordance with the regulations
prescribed in the subchapter, may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
height variance from such regulations. This application is to be made at the
Department office. The Department shall promptly notify the Board of Aviation
Commissioners or its designee of any and all height variances filed under this
section for the purpose of obtaining technical advice concerning the
aeronautical effects that the proposed structure will have on air traffic and
safety. This notification shall be at least ten days prior to any hearing by
the Board of Zoning Appeals. The application for height variance shall be
accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such height variances shall be
allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation,
will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this
section. If the Board of Aviation Commissioners, or its designee, does not
respond within a reasonable amount of time prior to the hearing by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, the Board of Zoning Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny
the height variance application.
   (F)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any height permit or height variance
granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of
this subchapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure in question to install, operate, and
maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.
If deemed proper by the Board of Zoning Appeals, this condition may be modified
to require the owner to allow the city, at its own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

regulations prescribed herein. Applications for height permits and height
variances required by this subchapter shall be submitted to the Department on
forms published for that purpose. The Board of Aviation Commissioners, or its
appointed designee, shall act as a technical advisor to the Board on any
request for a height permit or height variance regarding this section.

   Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this subchapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height or structures and the
use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or regulation
shall govern and prevail.

§ 158.059 INDIANA HIGH STRUCTURE SAFETY ACT; FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS.
   (A)   If any provision of this subchapter conflicts with the Indiana High
Structure Safety Act (I.C. 8-21-10-1 et. seq.), as it is now enacted or
hereafter amended, the more restrictive provision controls.
   (B)   Compliance with this subchapter does not relieve any person or entity
from its obligation to comply with federal or state laws which may or may not
be more restrictive; nor relieve any person or entity from its obligation to
obtain any studies or permits required by federal or state law.

upon by new livestock operations, as well as protecting approved livestock
operations from being encroached upon by new residential, commercial,
industrial, and public buildings.
      (2)   The provisions of this section shall apply to the raising of
livestock, including those authorized by meeting certain acreage requirements
under
Chapter 91; however it shall not apply to certain domestic animals having been

§ 159.07 DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR EROSION CONTROL
MEASURES.
   All erosion control measures, including but not limited to, those required
to comply with this chapter, shall meet the design criteria, standards and
specifications for erosion control measures similar to or the same as those
outlined in the then current City of Huntington- Stormwater Development Manual,
Field Office Technical Guide of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Services and the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas, Two
copies of these publications are on file for public inspection and/or copying
in the office of the city's Clerk-Treasurer. An additional source of
information is the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, published by IDNR, upon
availability.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.08 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES, WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF INDIVIDUAL LOTS WITHIN A PERMITTED PROJECT.
   Control of erosion and sediment is the responsibility of the landowner.
Design criteria, detail, and specifications are located in the city's
Stormwater Development Manual. General requirements for seeking a permit to
engage in land-disturbing activities are as follows.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to the following sites with land-
disturbing activities:
      (1)   Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or local improvement
location permit for the construction of commercial, residential or
institutional buildings on lots of approved subdivision plats;
      (2)   Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling, or other land-disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 10,000 square feet or more;
      (3)   Those involving excavation, filling, or a combination of excavation
and filling affecting 400 cubic yards or more of soil, gravel, stone or other
material;
      (4)   Those involving street, highway, road or bridge construction,
enlargement, relocation or reconstruction; and
      (5)   Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing or enlarging of an
underground pipe or utility for a distance of 300 feet or more.
   (B)   The following erosion and other sediment control requirements shall be
met on all such sites, with the exception of individual lots within a permitted
project.
      (1)   Site dewatering. Sediment-1aden water from dewatering activities
flowing from the site shall be detained by temporary sediment basins. Also,
water shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion in the receiving
channel.
      (2)   Waste and material disposal. Wastes or unused building materials,
including but not limited to, garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
toxic materials and hazardous substances, shall not be carried by runoff from a
site. Proper disposal of all wastes and used building materials, appropriate to
the nature of the waste material, is required.
      (3)   Tracking. Sediment being tracked from a site onto public or private
roadways shall be minimized. This can be accomplished initially by a wel1-
planned layout of roads, construction entrances, access drives, and parking
areas of sufficient width and length. However, protective covering also may be
necessary. Therefore, for the duration of the construction period and until
vegetation cover is in place, access to the lot will be limited to this single
location.
      (4)   Sediment removal. Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared
of accumulated sediment. If appreciable sedimentation occurs after a storm
event, the sediment shall be redeposited on the parcels of land, if in the
site, from where it likely originated so that the erosion and sedimentation
does not recur.
      (5)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
against sedimentation with straw bales, filter fabric or equivalent barriers
meeting accepted design criteria, standards and specifications. During winter
months, other methods may be incorporated as approved by the city.
      (6)   Site erosion control. The following items apply only to the time
period when land-disturbing activities are taking place.
         (a)   Runoff passing through a site from adjacent areas shall be
controlled by diverting it around disturbed areas. Alternatively, the existing
channel may be improved to prevent erosion or sedimentation from occurring.
         (b)   Runoff from a disturbed area shall be timely controlled by one
or more of the following measures.
            1.   To minimize erosion potential, unvegetated areas that are
scheduled or likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily
or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season. Alternative
measures to site stabilization are acceptable, if the project site owner(s) or
their representative(s) can demonstrate they have implemented erosion and
sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge. Vegetated
areas with a density of less than 70 percent shall be restabilized using
appropriate methods to minimize the erosion potential.
            2.   With disturbed areas within a site of ten acres or more, where
drainage is in the same direction or where runoff will result in loss of soil,
an abatement or recovery program is required. Where feasible, one or more
sediment basins shall be constructed.
            3.   With disturbed areas within a site of less than ten acres,
filter fences, straw bales or equivalent erosion control measures placed along
all sideslope and downslope sides of the site shall be required.
         (c)   Erosion from all storage piles shall be controlled by placing
straw bales, filter fence or other appropriate barriers around the piles.
Adjacent storm drain inlets shall be protected using similar filter barriers.
         (d)   Time is of the essence in controlling erosion. Accordingly, all
areas disturbed by excavation and for backfilling operations which expose soil
shall be compacted, sodded or re-seeded promptly after the site is graded. Seed
shall be a blend of fast-germinating seed, in addition to perennial grasses
suitable for the soil and exposure of the area to sunlight. All seeded areas
shall be mulched and disc-anchored as necessary for erosion protection and seed
retention.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL LOTS WITHIN A PERMITTED PROJECT.
   Provisions for erosion and sediment control on individual building lots
regulated under the original permit of a project site owner must include the
following requirements.
   (A)   The individual lot operator, whether owning the property or acting as
the agent of the property owner, shall be responsible for erosion and sediment
control requirements associated with activities on individual lots.
   (B)   Installation and maintenance of a stable construction site access
road.
   (C)   Installation and maintenance of appropriate perimeter erosion and
sediment control measures prior to land disturbance.
   (D)   Sediment discharge and tracking from each lot must be minimized
throughout the land-disturbing activities on the lot until permanent
stabilization has been achieved.
   (E)   Clean-up of sediment that is either tracked or washed onto roads. Bulk
clearing of sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment must be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in compliance
with all applicable authority.
   (F)   Adjacent lots disturbed by an individual lot operator must be repaired
and stabilized with temporary or permanent surface stabilization.
   (G)   For individual residential lots, final stabilization will be achieved
when the individual lot operator:
      (1)   Completes final stabilization; or
      (2)   Has installed appropriate erosion and sediment control measures for
an individual lot, prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner, and has
informed the homeowner of the requirement for, and benefits of, final
stabilization.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.10 MAINTENANCE OF EROSION CONTROL MEASURES.
   During the period of land disturbance at a site, all sediment basins and
other erosion control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter shall be provided by the applicant and subsequent landowner. If
sedimentation is likely to be a problem after land-disturbing activities have
ceased, some or all of the erosion control measures shall be maintained by the
applicant or subsequent landowner for as long as the problem would be likely
without such measures.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.11 PERMIT APPLICATION, EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN, AND PERMIT
ISSUANCE.
   No person shall begin a land-disturbing activity subject to this chapter,
without applying for and receiving approval of a city-issued permit for an
erosion and sediment control plan. An application shall be made only after an
initial coordination meeting with the city's enforcement department. By
submitting an application, the applicant is unconditionally consenting that the
city has been given permission to enter the site to obtain information required
and helpful for review of the erosion and sediment control plan. This approval
process and permit is in addition to a general stormwater permit (Rule 5)
required under 327 IAC 15-5, as in force at the time.
   (A)   Content of erosion and sediment control plan for land-disturbing
activities covering one or more acres in a given site. At a minimum, the
erosion and sediment control plan shall include: a project narrative, a

   (D)   Review of erosion and sediment control plan. The city shall review the
application and erosion and sediment control plan in conjunction with the
subdivision plat and local improvement permit application to determine whether
the requirements of this chapter have been met. If the requirements are not
met, the city shall inform the applicant in writing, and may either require
additional information or disapprove the plan. If so revised, additional
information shall be submitted. The city shall again determine whether the plan
meets the requirements of this chapter. If the plan is disapproved, the city
shall inform the applicant in writing, giving reasons for its disapproval.
   (E)   Permits.
      (1)   Surety bond. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit
for an erosion and sediment control plan, the city may require the applicant to
provide a surety bond or an irrevocable letter of credit, when the erosion and
sediment control plan has been approved, to guarantee a good faith execution of
the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit conditions.
      (2)   Requirements for implementing an approved erosion and sediment
control plan.

activities from adjacent surfaces and drainageways and/or repair erosion damage
to adjacent surfaces and drainageways; and
         (g)   Allow the city to enter the site to verify compliance with the
erosion and sediment control plan, or to perform any work necessary to bring
the site into compliance with that plan.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.12 INSPECTION.
   (A)   To ensure compliance with the erosion and sediment control plan, the
city shall inspect sites having ongoing land-disturbing activities, as deemed
appropriate by the city.
   (B)   If land-disturbing activities are being carried out without a permit
required by this chapter or other applicable authority, the city shall issue a
stop work order, pursuant to the provisions of IC 36-1-4-11, and take
appropriate action to bring the situation into compliance with the Huntington
City Code, pursuant to IC 36-1-6-2.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.13 PROPER CREDENTIALS OR IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   The city shall present proper credentials or identification before entering
upon a site.
(Ord. 21-C-04, passed 11-9-04)
§ 159.14 PROJECT TERMINATION.
   (A)   An orderly and timely termination of a project with land-disturbing
activities should be planned by all persons involved with a site.
   (B)   When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit shall
petition, in writing, the city for approval of the erosion control measures
that are to remain on the site to evaluate their adequacy.
      (1)   If the erosion control measures are approved by the city, any
surety bonds and/or letters of credit shall be released at that time. However,
maintenance responsibilities (see §
159.10) shall remain with the person owning the land.
      (2)   If the erosion control measures are not approved because they are
not in compliance with either the erosion and sediment control plan or the
purpose of this chapter, the city shall notify, in writing, the person holding
the permit of particulars. After a minimum period of two weeks during which
corrective measures are taken, a petition, again in writing, may be sent asking
the city to evaluate the adequacy of the erosion control measures. If, in good
faith, the city again decides that the erosion control measures are inadequate,
the city may delay the release of any surety bonds and/or letters of credit for
up to two months. After a minimum of two months has lapsed without adequate
corrective measures being taken, the city may use the surety bonds to pay for
changes or additions to the erosion control measures needed to complete the
project.
