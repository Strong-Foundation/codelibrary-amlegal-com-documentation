   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “town
code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances,” or

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered
by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

usual sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate

construed as imputing authority to a majority of those persons, unless
otherwise declared in the section giving that authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a statute stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) does not affect the operation of division
(B) with respect to that act.

§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section, reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.

refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which those duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words were clearly
intended to express the intent, that spelling shall be corrected and the word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
that section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code shall not be affected by
the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may

enacted.

§ 30.07 CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY; NEPOTISM POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a
policy of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and
in contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012 known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, respectively.

and a Contracting with a Unit Policy that comply with the minimum requirements
of I.C. 36-1-20.2 (hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter

authority over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make
work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.
   (G)   Cooperation in implementation. All elected and appointed officials and
employees of the town are hereby directed to cooperate fully in the
implementation of the policies created by this section and demonstrating
compliance with these same policies.
   (H)   Failure to abide by or cooperate a violation.
      (1)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a violation
and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a
transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An
elected or appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate
with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications
of the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
      (2)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the contracting with relatives of
elected officials, etc. policy is a violation and may result in the discipline,
including termination, of an employee or a transfer from the direct line of
supervision or other curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of the Contracting with Relatives
of Elected Officials, etc. Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.

greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or
adoption of the motion, then in that case a motion to reconsider may be made

reconsidered, so long as the issue presented is the same, no new information is
forthcoming, and the rights of third parties have not intervened.

Department or a plumber pre-approved by the town to use, handle, molest,
interfere with, or disturb any meter or any curb stop of the Town Water
Department within the town, or any street valve or appliance connected
therewith or belonging thereto, or to turn on or to turn off water at the same
time or by means thereof. In the event of a leak, persons must call the Town
Hall during business hours, or contact Hamilton County Dispatch after business

Town Water Utility employee or authorized representative.
   (B)   There will be a charge of $500 per day or each unauthorized water use
either from a service line or fire hydrant.
   (C)   In order to prevent possible damage from leaks, a representative of
the owner must be on hand at the premises before water will be turned on by
town personnel. When additional visits must be made to turn on the service due
to a leak not the fault of the town, an additional service fee of $35 will be
charged.
   (D)   Conditions for new municipal service water connection. Prior to the
closing of the sale of any premises within the town and the title to the
premises being transferred (as a result of a sale, gift, inheritance, and the
like), and the premises have been, are being or are to be supplied with water
service by the town's water utility, any existing water service shall be
discontinued and/or any municipal service water connection shall not be
connected to the town's public water system, as the case may be, until such
time as:
      (1)   A contract for water service has been executed by each user
occupying or intending to occupy each apartment, dwelling or business space
within the premises;
      (2)   Each user has paid the then-applicable water meter deposit to the
town's water utility; and
      (3)   One of the following:
         (a)   If the premises is a multi-unit dwelling or business space, the
number of permitted units within the premises is modified so that each unit
complies with the requirement of divisions (b)1. through (b)4. below. For
example, a three-unit premises may be converted to a two-unit premises; or
         (b)   Each apartment, dwelling or business space within the premises
shall have:
            1.   Separate, private water service lines installed at the expense
of owner, if, as determined by the Town Water Utility Superintendent, the
existing or proposed water service line is not of a size sufficient to
adequately serve the multiple units;
            2.   Shut off valves installed for each unit at the expense of the
owner, which shall be located so as to be readily accessible to water utility
employees for the purpose of discontinuing or terminating water service;
            3.   Necessary plumbing is performed at the expense of the owner to
accommodate and allow the installation of a separate water meter for each unit;
and
            4.   Separate water meters are provided and installed by the town's
water utility at the customers expense.
(Ord. 2021-10-02, passed 11-22-2021)
§ 50.07 SERVICE CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   A new service line on private property serving a single residence must
be a minimum of 3/4 inch in diameter, the pipe material must be as specified in
the standard specifications of the town and the construction cost thereof shall
be borne by the customer. Charges for installing the service line within the
public right-of-way shall also be borne by the customer. Upon approval of the
user's choice of construction contractor by the town, the user may arrange for
the construction of the service line within the public right-of-way.
   (B)   Connections within the public right-of-way must be adequately sized
and cannot be made unless approved by the town.
   (C)   Each service line extending from the water main to the meter location
shall be installed perpendicular to the water main. (Service lines must not be
placed under driveways or other large paved areas to prevent freezing.) For
service lines three inches and larger, a valve shall be installed immediately
adjacent to the main. A hot tap shall be used for all taps larger than two
inches in diameter.
   (D)   The town reserves the right to locate the curb stop:
      (1)   Between the curb and the sidewalk;
      (2)   On the customer's side of the meter pit; or
      (3)   On the property line; whichever, in the judgment of the town, will
provide the most protection.
   (E)   The customer shall, at his own expense, install and maintain the
service pipe on private property beginning at the curb stop or meter pit.
   (F)   Any person responsible for disturbing or damaging water services or
valve boxes, once the services have been properly installed, is responsible for
the cost of repairs.
(Ord. 2021-10-02, passed 11-22-2021)
§ 50.08 METERING.
   (A)   Typical service installation requires a meter pit. The meter pit
should be located on the town's property, near the property line; however, in
the event no suitable location is available on the town's property at the
discretion of the town, the meter pit may be located on the customer's
property. Installation close to the property line or on town property will
eliminate the need for a curb stop. The customer is responsible for the
maintenance and future replacement of the water line and equipment from the
"Meter 90" to the building. Barring customer's negligent destruction of the
waterline, the town will cover the costs associated with the repair and
replacement of equipment from the water main to the meter.
   (B)   In the event the town determines that a meter pit is not suitable, the
customer shall provide for this purpose, free of expense to the town, a
suitable area near the service line entrance to the premises either in the
basement or in a location which is approved by the town before installation.
Residential meters shall be installed three feet to three feet six inches above
the floor and as shown in the standard specifications of the town. The customer
shall provide and install approved full-port ball valves on the inlet and
outlet sides of the meter.
   (C)   The customer shall provide and maintain suitable means of access to
the meter with no obstructions of any kind within three feet of the meter. In
the event a meter is installed in a building, a remote reader antenna will be
installed on the outside of the building. In addition to this, a curb stop will
also be installed to allow for the town to shut off the service for non-
payment, or at property owner request at the customer's expense. The customer
shall be responsible for repair and maintenance of the waterline to the curb
stop.
   (D)   All new construction shall provide for the horizontal installation of
the water meter inside the structure in a heated, protected, and accessible
location.
   (E)   The town reserves the right to determine the type and size of meter to
be used on any service line. Water supplied to each customer shall be measured
by a meter supplied and installed by the town unless otherwise specified by the
Utility Superintendent.
   (F)   When the customer requires for use and convenience one or more
additional meters on a single property, the customer may purchase the
additional meter or meters from the town.
   (G)   Properly authorized agents of the town shall have the right to enter
upon the premises of the customer at all reasonable times for the purpose of
inspecting, reading, testing, repairing, or replacing the meter or meter
reading equipment used in connection with its service, and removing the meter
upon the termination of the contract or the discontinuance of the service.
Security and safety measures of the customer will be observed by town employees
and the customer shall provide any and all specialized safety equipment for
access to the meter. In the event access to the meter or reading device of the
customer is limited such as to hinder or restrict meter reading, the town may
elect to install a remote reading device at the expense of the customer.
   (H)   All meters or other equipment which are furnished by the town remain
the property of the town. The customer shall protect such property from
freezing and from loss or damage and only employees or the authorized agents of
the town are permitted to repair, replace, or remove such property.
   (I)   Ordinary repairs to meters will be made by the town without expense to
the customer. Repairs of damage caused by carelessness or negligence on the
part of the customer, including damage therefrom and the cost of a replacement
meter, will be charged to the customer. The town may discontinue service until
the customer properly protects the meter from damage.
(Ord. 2021-10-02, passed 11-22-2021)
§ 50.09 MAINTENANCE OF SERVICE LINES.
   (A)   All service lines one inch and smaller in diameter will be maintained
at the expense of the customer from the meter where a meter pit is used, or
from the curb stop where an interior installation has been used, as applicable.
The town will maintain service lines from the public water main to the meter
pit, or to the curb stop, as applicable.
   (B)   Existing services which extend to a customer not adjacent to a water
main, whether through public or private property, are considered to be a
private service line, the maintenance of which shall be solely at the
customer's expense.
   (C)   When an unmetered leak is detected by the town, the property owner
will be notified in writing and given appropriate time from the date of the
letter to eliminate the leak. If the leak is not repaired within this time, the
town will take appropriate corrective action and all costs will be billed to
the property owner.
(Ord. 2021-10-02, passed 11-22-2021)
§ 50.10 BACKFLOW PROTECTIONS.
   (A)   That a cross connection shall be defined as any physical connection or
arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains
potable water from the Town of Atlanta water system, and the other, water from
a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or
chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the
direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two
systems.
   (B)   That no person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No
interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private,
auxiliary, or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply
of town may enter the supply or distribution system of said municipality,
unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Town of
Atlanta Water Utility and by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management
in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10.
   (C)   That it shall be the duty of the Town of Atlanta Water Utility to
cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water
system where cross connections with the public water system is deemed possible.
The frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on potential health
hazards involved shall be established by the Town of Atlanta Water Utility.
   (D)   That upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Town
of Atlanta Water Utility shall have the right to request entry at any
reasonable time to examine the property served by a connection to the public
water system of town for cross connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any
pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.
The refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be
deemed evidence of the presence of cross connections.
   (E)   That the Town of Atlanta Water Utility is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in
violation of this section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures
deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
system. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is
served on the owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a
violation is found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall
not be restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
   (F)   That, if it is deemed by the Town of Atlanta Water Utility that a
cross connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare
and requires immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed
with the clerk of the town and delivered to the consumer's premises, service
may be immediately discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for
hearing within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.
   (G)   That all consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous
users install and maintain a reduced pressure principal backflow preventer in
the main water line serving each building on the premises. The backflow
preventer must be installed in an easily accessible location not subject to
flooding or freezing.
   (H)   The reduced pressure principle backflow preventers shall not be
installed below ground level.
   (I)   That this section does not supersede the Indiana Plumbing Code, the
IDEM Rule 327 IAC 8-10, applicable Building Codes, or other town ordinance, but
is supplementary to them.
   (J)   In addition to IDEM Rule 327 IAC 8-10-4(c), a list of customer
facilities needing a backflow prevention device is available.
   (K)   That if, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system; the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water consumer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his
own expenses, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Superintendent of Water and shall have inspections and tests
made of such approved devices as required by the Superintendent of Water and in
accordance with the IDEM Rule TH IAC 8-10. Annual testing report is to be
submitted to the town.

date falls on a holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, the "intention to file lien"
letter shall then be distributed on the first business day following the

appeal request shall set forth in detail: (1) the extraordinary hardship or
other unavoidable circumstances whereby the delinquent bill cannot be fully

capricious. The Town Council shall consider such appeal at its next scheduled
Town Council meeting. Any contemplated discontinuation of utility service shall
be deferred pending the determination of the appeal by the Town Council. The
Town Council in its appeal determination may: (1) deny the appeal; (2) grant

§ 53.11 DELINQUENT CUSTOMERS.
   (A)   Any customer whose bill remains unpaid at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th day of
the month after the billing date shall be considered delinquent. Any customer
who is delinquent may be contacted by the town in an attempt to collect payment
for the delinquent bill.
   (B)   After the 25th day of the month, the town may refer any delinquent
customers to a collection agency or attorney for collection. Delinquent
accounts are also subject to the filing of liens in accordance with the town's
billing procedure.
   (C)   Delinquent accounts that have been filed as liens can no longer be
paid in the normal manner, but must be paid to the county in the manner
prescribed by the county for lien payments. Lien filings will include
reasonable collection and attorney fees.
   (D)   In the case of a non-owner occupied property, the deeded owner will be
notified of any utility bills related to their property that remain outstanding
beyond the 25th day of the month that the bill is due.
   (E)   The Town Council hereby grants authority to the Clerk-Treasurer to
offer to delinquent customers one bill workout plan not more often than once
each 12 month period (beginning on a month that the customer is current on all
of its town utility bills). This bill workout procedure will be that the
customer must pay monthly a payment consisting of two parts. The first part is
the entire balance of the current monthly bill after the workout plan begins.
The second part is one-third of the amount that was due before the bill workout
plan began. This workout procedure is intended to allow the delinquent customer
to become current within a three month period. No additional late fees will
accrue to the delinquent portion of the bill starting with the date the workout
is approved and continuing during the three month period of the workout. If the
delinquent customer defaults on this agreement by paying less than the
calculated amount due, the bill workout agreement terminates immediately, and
without further notice, and the town's normal and customary bill collection
procedures begin. This would include water service disconnection, sewage and
stormwater lien filing, and other bill collection procedures.
   (F)   After a bill workout plan terminates, the Clerk-Treasurer cannot offer
another bill workout plan to that customer for 12 months from the last current
payment.
   (G)   The above described bill workout procedure in no way limits the powers
or the authority of the Town Council to modify or adjust a bill, or offer a
different or additional workout procedure for delinquent customers.

   (B)   Only the Town Council has the ability to modify, change, adjust,
mitigate, or otherwise alter a utility bill.
(Ord. 2020-01-01, passed 1-14-2020)
§ 53.13 PROMISSORY AGREEMENT.
   Any customer may request a face-to-face conference before the Town Council
to consider entering into a payment plan or promissory agreement that
identifies certain terms and conditions of a payment plan that would cause a
utility account to be made current. If a customer fails to make good on any
term and/or condition contained within the promissory agreement, other
collection procedures may be implemented immediately.
(Ord. 2020-01-01, passed 1-14-2020)
§ 53.14 SERVICE CHARGES.
   The following additional fees shall be charged for services provided by the

vehicle is not removed within ten days pursuant to the order and notice, any
member of the Police Department shall cause the vehicle to be removed by a
licensed junk or salvage yard or wrecker service or by employees of the town.

LOITERING
§ 130.15 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi- public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property
utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free
passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person
to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open
to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

PLACEMENT OF TRASH OR RUBBISH
§ 130.20 PLACEMENT OR DISPOSAL OF GRASS CLIPPINGS, LEAVES, TRASH OR RUBBISH.

any grass clippings, leaves, trash, or rubbish in or upon the streets,

to either division (A) or §
93.02 depending on the circumstances of each request, and in accordance with
this town code and Indiana law.
   (C)   The town, its designees or employees shall be responsible for

violations and to take all necessary action to enforce this section. The town,
its designees or employees shall have discretion to enforce this section in
accordance with this town code and Indiana law.

§ 151.46 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   Any person aggrieved by an order issued under this chapter shall have the
right to petition for review of any order of the Building Commissioner. Such a
person may file a petition using either, or both, of the following procedures:
   (A)   Appeal to the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission.
      (1)   A person aggrieved by an order issued under this chapter may appeal
to the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission, in accordance with I.C.
22-13-2-7.
      (2)   The Commission may modify or reverse any order issued by the city
that covers a subject governed by I.C. 22-12, I.C. 22-13, I.C. 22-14, I.C. 22-
15, a fire safety, or a building rule.
      (3)   The Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission must review
orders that concern a Class 2 Structure if the person aggrieved by the order
petitions for review under I.C. 4-21.5-3-7 within 30 days after the issuance of
the order.
      (4)   The Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission may review all
other orders issued under this chapter.
      (5)   The review of an order by the Fire Prevention and Building Safety
Commission does not suspend the running of the time period under any statute in

   (B)   Appeal to an Established Local Administrative Body or Court. If,
pursuant to I.C. 36-1-6-9 or I.C. 36-7-4-9 et seq., the town has established by

Board of Zoning Appeals, then a person aggrieved by an order may petition for
review with this administrative body in accordance with said ordinance. If no
such administrative body exists, then the person may petition a court for
judicial review of the order.

UNSAFE BUILDING CODE
§ 151.60 UNSAFE BUILDING CODE.
   Be it ordained by the Town Council that:
   (A)   Under the provisions of I.C. 36-7-9, there is hereby established the
Town of Atlanta Unsafe Building Law.
   (B)   I.C. 36-7-9-1 through 36-7-9-28 is hereby incorporated by reference in
the town Unsafe Building Law. All proceedings within the jurisdiction of the
town for the inspection, repair, and removal of unsafe buildings shall be
governed by the law and the provisions of this subchapter. In the event the
provisions of this section conflict with the provisions of I.C. 36-7-9-
1 through 36-7-9-28, then provisions of the state statute shall control.
   (C)   All buildings or portions thereof within the municipal boundaries of
the town which are determined after inspection by the Atlanta Building
Commissioner, or his or her designee, to be unsafe as defined in this
subchapter or in I.C. 36-7-9-1 et seq., are hereby declared to be public
nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal.
   (D)   The Atlanta Building Commissioner, or his or her designee, shall be
considered the “enforcement authority” for the implementation of the subchapter
and shall be authorized to administer and to proceed under the provisions of
the law in ordering the repair or removal of any buildings found to be unsafe
as specified therein or as specified hereafter.
   (E)   Wherever in the Town of Atlanta Unsafe Building Law, it is provided
that anything must be done to the approval of or subject to the direction of
the Atlanta Building Commissioner, or any other officer of the Town of Atlanta,
this shall be construed to give such officer only the discretion of determining
whether the rules and standards established by subchapter have been complied
with; and no such provisions shall be construed as giving any officer
discretionary powers as to what such regulations or standards shall be, power
to require conditions not prescribed by subchapter, or to enforce ordinance
provisions in an arbitrary or discretionary manner.
   (F)   The description of an unsafe building contained in I.C. 36-7-9-4 is
hereby supplemented to provide minimum standards for building condition or
maintenance in the jurisdiction of the town, by adding the following
definition.
      UNSAFE BUILDING. Any building or structure which has any or all of the
conditions or defects hereinafter described, provided that such conditions or
defects exist to the extent that life, health, property, or safety of the
public or its occupants are endangered:
         (a)   Whenever any door, aisle, passageway, or other means of exit is
not of sufficient width or size or is not so arranged as to provide safe and
adequate means of exit in case of fire or panic.
         (b)   Whenever the walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway
or other means of exit is so warped, worn, loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as
not to provide safe and adequate means of exit in case of fire or panic.
         (c)   Whenever the stress in any materials, member, or portion
thereof, due to all dead and live loads, is more than 1½ times the working
stress or stresses allowed for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or
location.
         (d)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire,
earthquake, wind, flood, or by any other cause, to such an extent that the
structural strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was before
catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of
similar structure, purpose, or location.
         (e)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is likely
to fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property.
         (f)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance,
or ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for such buildings.
         (g)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled, or
settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have
materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes that is required in the case
of similar new construction.
         (h)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof,
because of (I) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii) faulty construction;
(iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground
necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the deterioration,
decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause, is likely to
partially or completely collapse.
         (I)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any
portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe of the purpose for which it is being
used.
         (j)   Whenever the exterior walls or other walls or other vertical
structural members list, lean, or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line
passing through the center of gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third
of the base.
         (k)   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the
foundations, shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member
or members, or 50% damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members,
enclosing or outside walls or coverings.
         (l)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire,
wind, earthquake, or flood or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated so as
to become (I) an attractive nuisance to children; or (ii) freely accessible to
persons for the purpose of committing unlawful acts.
         (m)   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists,
or is maintained in violation of any building or structure provided by the
building regulations of the town, or of any law or ordinance of this state or
the town relating to the condition, location, or structure of buildings.
         (n)   Whenever any building or structure which, whether or not erected
in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances has in any non-supporting
part, member, or portion less than 50%, or in any supporting part, member, or
portion less than 66% of the (I) strength, (ii) fire resisting qualities or
characteristics, or (iii) weather-resisting qualities or characteristics
required by law in the case of a newly constructed building of like area,
height, and occupancy in the same location.
         (o)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used
for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation
facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the Hamilton County Sanitarian to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
         (p)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction is determined by the local Fire Chief or
State Fire Marshal to be a fire hazard.
         (q)   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
   (G)   The definition of SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY INTEREST set forth in I.C. 36-
7-9-2 is hereby incorporated by reference herein as if copied in full.
   (H)   All work for the reconstruction, repair, or demolition of buildings
and other structures shall be performed in a good workmanlike manner according
to the accepted standards and practices in the trade. The provisions of the
building laws, as defined in I.C. 22-12-1-3, and as amended from time to time,
adopted as rules of the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission, shall
be considered standard and acceptable practice for all matters covered by this
subchapter or orders issued pursuant to this subchapter by the Atlanta Building
Commissioner, or his or her designee.
   (I)   An Unsafe Building Fund is hereby established in the operating budget
of the town in accordance with the provisions of I.C. 36-7-9-14.
   (J)   No person, firm, or corporation, whether as owner, lessee, sublessee
or occupancy, shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve,
remove, demolish, equip, use, occupy, or maintain any building or premises, or
cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the
provisions of this subchapter or any order issued by the Atlanta Building
Commissioner. Any person violating the provisions of this subchapter or I.C.
36-7-9-28 shall commit a Class C infraction for each day such violation
continues.
   (K)   The Atlanta Town Council shall be and is hereby designated as the
Hearing Authority in connection with the terms and provisions of this
subchapter and I.C. 36-7-9-1 et seq.
