§ 30.14 PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The most recent edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, newly revised,
shall be the authority on all questions of parliamentary law and procedure not
specifically covered by this subchapter. For the purposes of this subchapter,
parliamentary law shall mean the enacted rules and recognized usages which
govern the procedure of legislative assemblies.
   (B)   It shall require a majority vote of 5 of the 9 Council members, to
pass an ordinance or resolution. Whenever by law it is required that any
ordinance or resolution shall be passed by a 2/3 vote, the requirement shall be
construed to mean a 2/3 vote of all Council members; i.e., 6 of the 9 members.
Whenever by law it is required that any ordinance or resolution shall be passed
by a 3/4 vote, the requirement shall be construed to mean a 3/4 vote of all
Council members; i.e., 7 of the 9 members.
   (C)   No one not a member of Council shall be permitted to address the
Council except on invitation by the Presiding Officer or by a majority vote of
the Council.
   (D)   No ordinance or resolution shall be received or considered by the
Council unless it is presented by some member thereof or as provided by law.
Every motion made by any member of the Council and entertained by the Presiding
Officer shall be reduced to writing on the demand of any Council member. When a
motion has been made, the Presiding Officer shall state it, and it shall then
be in the possession of the Council, but may be withdrawn at any time before a
decision or amendment.
   (E)   When, in order to enact an ordinance, resolution or motion, state law
requires a majority of the Council to vote “aye”, the following procedures
shall be applicable in calculating the majority.
      (1)   Only Council members who have disqualified themselves on a matter
due to a substantial conflict of interest or have disclosed fully the nature of
their conflict of interest pursuant to the provisions of this chapter are
entitled to an abstention.
      (2)   Absentations shall not be counted as either an “aye” or “nay” vote.
   (F)   The Presiding Officer shall decide whether any question is carried by
an affirmative or a negative vote, but if he or she is in doubt, a roll call
vote shall be asked for.
   (G)   When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received, but to
adjourn, to lay on the table, for the previous questions (which motion shall be
decided without debate), to postpone to a day certain, to refer, to amend or to
postpone indefinitely, which several motions shall have preference in the order
in which they are here arranged.
      (1)   The motion to adjourn and the motion to fix a time to which the
Council shall adjourn shall always be in order, the latter motion taking
precedence of the former.
      (2)   The motion to lay an amendment on the table shall not affect the
main question which it is proposed to amend.
      (3)   The previous question shall be put in this form: "I move for the
main question. " It shall only be granted when demanded by a simple majority of
the Council; and its effect shall be to put an end to all debate, and until
decided, shall preclude all other motions or amendments, except the motion to
adjourn. If the motion is sustained, the Presiding Officer shall at once put
the question, first on pending amendments and then on the main questions.
      (4)   The motion to postpone to a day certain can be amended by altering
the time.
      (5)   The motion to commit may be amended by altering the committee or by
giving instructions.
      (6)   A motion to amend and a motion to amend that amendment shall be in
order, and it shall also be in order to offer a further amendment by way of
substitute to which 1 amendment may be offered, but neither may be withdrawn
before amendment or decision is had thereon.
      (7)   No motion or proposition postponed indefinitely shall be taken up
again at the same or next succeeding meeting.
      (8)   A question shall be divided on the demand of any Council member, if
it includes 2 or more distinct propositions.
      (9)   A motion to strike out and insert shall be indivisible, but a
motion to strike out being lost shall neither preclude amendment nor motion to
strike out and insert, and no consideration shall be submitted under color of
amendment.
      (10)      When a motion has been made and carried or lost, it shall be in
order for any member of the majority at the same or the next regular meeting,
to move for the reconsideration thereof. Such a motion on being made may be
seconded by any Council member and may be made at any time. It shall be
debatable and requires a majority vote to prevail.
   (H)   When a resolution is offered or a report or other matter presented,
the Presiding Officer may take the reception thereof for granted, unless
objection is made, when a formal motion shall be required.
   (I)   Appeals, questions of order, objection to the consideration of a
question, the reading of papers, leave to withdraw a motion and suspension of
the rules are questions which shall take precedence of and be decided before
the question which gave rise to them; which several questions cannot be
amended, and all questions of order which may arise pending a question is not
debatable must be decided without debate.

motions to reconsider shall be by roll call.
   (H)   When a resolution is introduced, it shall be read by title only, after
which, if there is no objection, it shall stand ready for adoption. If there is
objection, it shall be in order for any Council member to make a proper motion
for disposition of the resolution.
   (I)   No proposition to rescind or change any standing rule or order of the
Council shall be passed at the same meeting it is submitted, nor shall any

like relating to the government of the Council or the duties of any of the city
officers be passed except in the form of an ordinance and according to the
forms prescribed for the passage of ordinances.

however, no ordinance shall become effective before publication thereof.
   (K)   Unless an ordinance shall expressly provide to the contrary, if any
portion of an ordinance or the application thereof to any person or
circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or
applications of the ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid
portion or application, provided the remaining portions or applications are not
determined by the court to be inoperative and to this ordinance are declared to
be severable.
   (L)   When a motion has been made and carried or lost, it shall be in order
for any member of the prevailing side, as described at § 36(a) of the latest
edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, at the same or the next regular meeting, to
move for the reconsideration thereof. Such a motion upon being made may be

§ 32.002 DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.
   (A)   OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, as used in this section, shall
include: The Mayor, department heads and all board and commission members of
the city; all elected or appointed officials of the city, including the Judge
of the City Court, and members of the Council; the city’s reserve police
officers; and all other employees of the city.
   (B)   To the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution of the State of
Indiana and applicable state law, the city shall indemnify and defend its
respective officers, employees and agents, as those terms are herein defined,
without expense to those persons, with respect to any action filed against them
in their official or individual capacities, or both, if the action complained
of was taken within the scope and arising out of the performance of official
duties and responsibilities.
   (C)   Indemnification pursuant to this section shall encompass any judgment
recovered against any such officer, employee or agent in any court of law
having jurisdiction thereof, arising out of a civil action brought to recover
damages to persons or property resulting from alleged acts of negligence or
wrongful acts or omissions of an officer, employee or agent acting within the
scope of his or her authority and employment or appointment.
   (D)   The obligation to indemnify shall not extend to acts of malice, acts
of a willful and wanton nature, criminal acts, acts calculated to accrue to the
personal benefit of the individual officer, employee or agent, or acts which
are clearly beyond the duties and/or scope of authority and employment of the
person (herein the “conditions”). A determination by a court of law as to
presence of any of the conditions or the absence of all the conditions shall be
conclusive as to the absence of all the conditions or the presence of any of
the conditions.
      (1)   In the absence of the judicial determination, the City Attorney
shall, within 14 working days after the date that a final, noninterlocutory
judgment becomes nonappealable to and nonreviewable by all federal and state
appellate courts and all federal and state supreme courts, present to the
Council a written finding as to whether any of the conditions are present or
all of the conditions are absent. The City Attorney shall forward a copy of the
written finding to the subject employee, officer or agent.
         (a)   If the City Attorney determines all the conditions are absent,
he or she will allow the subject employee and the employee’s attorney, if
applicable, an opportunity to meet with the City Attorney for informational
purposes within 14 working days of the employee’s receipt of the City
Attorney’s determination. The determination by the City Attorney shall prevail
and be conclusive unless the Council, within 90 working days of the receipt by
the Council thereof, passes a resolution rejecting the finding. If the Council
rejects the finding of the City Attorney, the Council’s rejection shall
conclusively determine whether any of the conditions are present. The Council
shall follow the procedure outlined in division (D)(1)(b)1. and 2. below.
         (b)   If the City Attorney determines any of the conditions are
present, the Council shall, within 7 working days of the receipt of the
Attorney’s written findings, offer the employee an opportunity to obtain
counsel and present evidence at a hearing in front of a neutral attorney or
arbitrator, as described in this division. The employee will have 21 working
days from the date of the employee’s receipt of the determination of the City
Attorney, to obtain counsel and request a hearing. The employee’s request must
be submitted in writing to the Council.
         (c)   If the hearing is requested, 1 of the following shall occur:
            1.   If the city’s Bar Association has agreed to provide an odd-
numbered list of attorneys who have volunteered to individually, on a pro bono
basis, hear evidence provided by the city and the employee and then make a
determination in regard to the presence of or absence of the conditions, the
employee and/or employee’s counsel shall meet with the City Attorney within 14
working days from the date of the Council’s receipt of the employee’s written
request for a hearing to select, by striking, an attorney from the list
provided by the Elkhart City Bar Association (“neutral attorney”). The neutral
attorney shall, within 30 working days of his or her selection, schedule a
hearing to hear evidence presented by the employee or the employee’s counsel
and the City Attorney in regard to whether any of the conditions are present.
The employee and the city shall have the right, to the extent allowable by
state law, to subpoena witnesses and documentation for the hearing. After the
hearing is held, the neutral attorney shall, within 21 working days after the
hearing, forward to the Council his or her determination as to whether any of
the conditions are present or all of the conditions are absent. The Council
shall have 14 working days to review, in executive session(s), the
determination by the neutral attorney, and to meet with the neutral attorney or
the neutral attorney, the City Attorney, the employee, and any counsel for the
employee to receive any clarifying information in regard to whether any of the
conditions exist. The Council shall then, within such 21 working days, make a
determination as to whether all the conditions are absent or any of the
conditions are present. The determination by the Council shall conclusively
determine whether all the conditions are absent or any of the conditions are
present.
            2.   If the city’s Bar Association has not agreed to provide a list
of attorneys pursuant to division (D)(1)(b)1., the employee may, within 21
working days of the employee’s request for a hearing, file with the American
Arbitration Association a request to arbitrate the issue of whether any of the
conditions are present or all of the conditions are absent. After the American
Arbitration Association holds an arbitration hearing and makes a determination
in regard to the presence or absence of the conditions, the determination shall
be binding on the Council and the determination shall conclusively determine
whether all the conditions are absent or any of the conditions are present. The
cost of the arbitration will be equally borne by the parties.
   (E)   If, through the operation of this section, it is conclusively
established that any of the conditions are present, the determination shall not
bar the city from paying the subject judgment, the determination only indicates
that this section does not, in such circumstance, create an obligation to pay
the judgment. The city would still have the discretion to pay the judgment.
However, if, through the operation of this section, it is conclusively
determined that all of the conditions are absent, the city is obligated to
cover the subject judgment.

(Ord. 5552, passed 2-13-2017)
VACATIONS AND HOLIDAYS
§ 32.035 VACATIONS AND PAID HOLIDAY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Scope. This section shall apply to all full-time employees of the city
who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
   (B)   Vacation. The vacation schedule for the city employees of the City of
Elkhart is set forth below:
      (1)   Except for employees described in divisions (B)(6) and (B)(7)
below, the vacation time for new and rehired employees is awarded in the first
year of employment, upon the completion of a (90-day) probationary period as an
employee of the city. Thereafter, vacation time is earned on the anniversary
date of an employee's date of hire or rehire, according to the schedule set
forth in division (B)(3) below.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (B)(1) above, if an employee's employment
is terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, during the first year of
employment, the employee shall be paid compensation based upon the employee's
daily rate of pay for the days of unused vacation time, relative to and in
proportion to the amount of first year worked. If an employee has used a
greater percentage of the employee's vacation time than the percentage of the
first year worked, then the employee's final pay shall be reduced by the amount
of vacation time used that is greater than the percent of the first year
worked. The reduction shall be based upon the employee's daily rate of pay.
      (3)   Employees shall be entitled to:
         (a)   Two weeks (10 workdays) of vacation with pay after successfully
completing a 90-day probationary period in the first year of employment, and on
the anniversary date of the employee's date of hire in succeeding years.
         (b)   Three weeks (15 workdays) of vacation with pay in year 4 of
employment.
         (c)   Four weeks (20 workdays) of vacation with pay in year 7 of
employment.
         (d)   Five weeks (25 workdays) of vacation with pay in year 15 of
employment.
      (4)   In addition to the above entitlement, commencing in year 20 and
each year thereafter, an employee shall receive the following:
         (a)   One additional vacation day with pay in year 20;
         (b)   One additional vacation day with pay in year 21;
         (c)   One additional vacation day with pay in year 22;
         (d)   One additional vacation day with pay in year 23;
         (e)   One additional vacation day with pay in year 24.
      (5)   Employees receiving less than 6 weeks of vacation time (30
workdays) on their anniversary date may carry-over up to 40 hours (5 workdays)
of vacation time, to be added to the new vacation time which an employee
receives on the employee's anniversary date. Any unused vacation time,
exceeding 40 hours on the employee's anniversary date, shall lapse and shall
not carryover to be added to vacation time that the employee receives in
succeeding year.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the provisions otherwise set forth in this section,
for determining the vacation schedule for new and rehired employees, if a
former city employee is rehired by the city into the same or another city
position within 90 calendar days of the date of separation, then the rehired
employee's vacation time shall be determined by including the employee's prior
service time, which had been credited to the employee for vacation purposes on
the date of the employee's recent separation.
         (a)   A new anniversary date shall be determined for the rehired
employee. The new anniversary date shall be determined by ascertaining the
number of days that the employee was separated from the city. The resulting
number, when added to the employee's original anniversary date, is the new
anniversary date. For example, an employee with an anniversary date of July 1,
who separates from the city on January 1, 2024, and returns to the city's
employ on March 1, 2024, will have a new anniversary date of August 30 (1/1/24
to 3/1/24 is 60 days: 31 + 29 = 60, February 2024 being a leap year, and 7/1/24
+ 60 days = 8/30).
         (b)   On the new anniversary date, the rehired employee shall receive
the vacation time otherwise established in division (B)(3) above for an
employee in the corresponding anniversary year of service.
         (c)   Any unused sick time which had accrued for the benefit of the
employee at the time of separation, for which the employee was not compensated
and which lapsed, shall be restored for the benefit of the employee's use, but
may not be paid out upon subsequent separation.
         (d)   Any current employees for whom the application of this division
(B)(6) would alter the employee's vacation or sick benefits, if applied at the
time of re-hire, may request a recalculation as provided herein to receive
benefits prospectively, as of the effective date of this division (B)(6).
      (7)   Notwithstanding, division (B)(3) above, the vacation time for an
employee hired or appointed to a position which is:
         (a)   Classified as both exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act and
considered "policy-level" under state and federal law; or
         (b)   A key professional position, defined as a position requiring
specialized expertise demonstrated by professional licensure issued by the
State of Indiana and required for the performance of the primary duties and
responsibilities for which the employee is employed by the city, as an
engineer, certified public account, or attorney;
Shall be determined by the Mayor:
         (a)   At or higher than the first-tier level, proscribed for first-
year city employees under division (B)(3)(a) above, but not higher than the
third-tier level, otherwise proscribed for seventh-year employees under
division (B)(3)(c) above.
         (b)   The vacation benefit in subsequent years shall be determined as
though the employee possessed the requisite years of prior service, and shall
progress to higher level tiers as anniversary years are added to the initial
level forward.
   (C)   Voluntary transfer of vacation time program. The Department of Human
Resources is authorized to develop a program to allow the transfer of vacation
leave time by 1 employee for the benefit of another employee, who is without
available leave time while experiencing a verified catastrophic loss, injury,
or illness of the employee, the employee's child, parent, or spouse.
   (D)   Sick leave. The sick leave schedule for employees of the city shall be
as follows: each employee will accrue 4 hours of paid sick leave each 2-week
period for short-term sickness during the calendar year.
   (E)   Holidays.
      (1)   The employees of the city shall be granted 12 holidays with pay in
addition to the primary and general election days in election years, as
follows:
         (a)   New Year's Day, January 1;
         (b)   Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, the third Monday in January;
         (c)   President's Day, the third Monday in February;
         (d)   Good Friday;
         (e)   Memorial Day, the last Monday in May;
         (f)   Juneteenth, June 19;
         (g)   Independence Day, July 4;

(Ord. 5086, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 33.504 ROAD MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS.
   It is recognized by the Common Council that there is a perpetual and growing
need for the maintenance, repair, paving, preservation, and upgrading of the
roads and streets under the jurisdiction of city government, and that the
Street Department and Department of Public Works, develop plans, projects, and
programs for such, and seek appropriations and allocations of monies by the
Common Council therefore, as part of the annual budgetary process, and
otherwise. Such undertakings are herewith referred to as road maintenance
programs. Requests for use of monies from the Fund for road maintenance
programs shall be submitted annually to the Expenditure Review Committee, as
part of the regular budgetary process. The following additional or altered
goals, standards, and procedures shall apply relative to such road maintenance
programs:
   (A)   A portion of the accumulated earnings from the Fund shall be
appropriated annually by the Common Council for road maintenance programs.
   (B)   The amount of such annual appropriation for road maintenance programs
shall be determined by the Common Council, after the Expenditure Review
Committee has submitted its report to the Mayor and the Common Council, and the
Mayor has submitted to the Common Council the desired appropriation amount from
the Fund for road maintenance programs.
   (C)   Monies appropriated for road maintenance programs shall not be subject
to the otherwise existing repayment standard or the otherwise existing payment
of interest on appropriated monies from the Fund, it being established that
expenditures from the Fund for road maintenance programs shall be exempt from
such repayment and interest payment standards.
   (D)   No appropriation of monies from the Fund for road maintenance programs
shall cause the targeted growth rate for the Fund, set forth in §
33.505, to go unattained, on a regular and ongoing basis, though due to
fluctuations in interest rates, during the course of any 12-month cycle,
interest earnings on monies in the Fund may be adversely affected, which
adverse impact, if any, shall be considered relative to future appropriations
for road maintenance programs from the Fund by the Mayor, Common Council, and
Expenditure Review Committee, so as to stabilize and restore the desired target
growth rate(s).
   (E)   Appropriations from the Fund for road maintenance programs shall not
require the documentation contemplated by §
33.506.
(Ord. 5086, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 33.505 TARGET GROWTH RATES.
   (A)   Monies in the Fund shall grow, on an annualized basis, so that the
interest earned by monies in the Fund, and interest paid back on appropriations
from the Fund subject to repayment programs, collectively exceed appropriations
for road maintenance programs. Annually, and as part of the budgetary process
for city government generally, the Expenditure Review Committee, using the best
economic records and information available, shall recommend to the Mayor and
the Common Council a target growth rate for the succeeding calendar year,
commencing with the calendar year 2009; the target growth rate for the calendar
year 2008 is stipulated by the Common Council to be 1.9%. The target growth
rate to be recommended by the Expenditure Review Committee, subject to actual
approval by the Mayor and the Common Council, shall not be less than 30% nor
more than 50% of the projected interest earnings by the Fund for the succeeding
calendar year. The approval of the target growth rate by the Mayor and the
Common Council shall take place as part of the annual budgetary process for
city government; should the Mayor and Common Council be unable to agree upon
the target growth rate, the target growth rate recommended by the Expenditure
Review Committee shall control for the succeeding calendar year.
   (B)   An example of establishing the target growth rate (for illustrative
purposes only) is as follows:
      (1)   Assume the Fund balance as projected by the Expenditure Review
Committee as of January 1, 2008 to be $26,500,000.
      (2)   Assume that earnings on loaned and advanced monies, as well as
earnings on monies retained within the Fund, shall average 5% per annum for the
calendar year 2008, giving rise to projected interest earnings of $1,325,000.
      (3)   Assume that the Expenditure Review Committee recommends that 80% of
such interest earnings shall be appropriated for road maintenance programs per
annum, which recommendation shall be accepted by the Mayor and Common Council.
If 80% of the interest earnings are targeted for road maintenance programs, the
balance of the interest earnings, to-wit: 20%, shall be added to and become a
part of the Fund and ultimately the Fund balance; 20% of the 5% interest
earnings represents a 1% target growth rate; 20% of the projected interest
earnings would be $265,000 to be added to the Fund balance. The appropriation
for road maintenance programs, out of such interest earnings, would be in the
amount of $1,060,000 under the example herein set forth.
(Ord. 5086, passed 12-17-2007)
§ 33.506 DOCUMENTATION.
   With the exception of appropriations for road maintenance programs, no
appropriation of monies from the Fund shall be made without documentation that
requires repayment of the monies appropriated and states the interest rate, and
method of payment of accruing interest, applicable to the monies so
appropriated. Such documentation shall define the contemplated sources of
revenue for the repayment of the monies advanced and the interest accruing, and
shall be in such form, and contain such standards, pledges, and remedies as the
Expenditure Review Committee shall require.
(Ord. 5086, passed 12-17-2007)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.01 PUBLIC POLICY.
   (A)   It is the public policy of the city to provide all of its citizens
equal opportunity for education, employment, access to public conveniences and
accommodations and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property
including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate segregation or
separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex, national origin,
ancestry or disability, since such segregation is an impediment to equal
opportunity. Equal education and employment opportunities and equal access to
and use of public accommodations and equal opportunity for acquisition of real
property are hereby declared to be civil rights and rights to be protected by
the city by the means provided in this chapter and the Fair Housing Chapter as
set out in
Chapter 93 of this code.
   (B)   The practice of denying these rights to properly qualified persons by
reason of the race, religion, color, sex, national origin, ancestry or
disability of such person is contrary to the principles of freedom and equality
of opportunity and is a burden to the objectives of the public policy of this
city and shall be considered as discriminatory practices. The promotion of
equal opportunity without regard to race, religion, color, sex, national
origin, ancestry or disability through reasonable methods is the purpose of
this chapter.
   (C)   It is also the public policy of the city to protect employers, labor
organizations, employment agencies, property owners, real estate brokers,
builders and lending institutions from unfounded charges of discrimination.
   (D)   No person may coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with any other
person:
      (1)   In the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by
this chapter; or
      (2)   Because the person has exercised or enjoyed, or has aided or
encouraged another person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or
protected by this chapter.
   (E)   This chapter shall be construed broadly to effectuate its purpose.

“disability” is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize
testing for the illegal use of drugs.

(1979 Code, § 37.02) (Ord. 3262, passed 12-9-1980)
ELEMENTS OF PLAN
§ 37.15 DESCRIPTION OF PLAN; APPLICATION.
   (A)   Affirmative action is defined as analyzing the methods, procedures and
results of personnel actions to determine whether qualified workers have been
excluded for reasons of race, sex, color, religion, national origin, ancestry,
age or physical handicap. Affirmative action means taking every appropriate
corrective action to bring about the desired equal opportunity in employment.
   (B)   The affirmative action plan applies to all departments, boards,
commissions, divisions and agencies of the city governmental structures. The
city views the affirmative action program as a results-oriented program
designed to enhance the opportunities of all groups represented in the plan.
The city recognizes that the ultimate success of this undertaking will be
largely the result of the good faith efforts detailed in §§
37.15 through
37.20.
(1979 Code, § 37.10) (Ord. 3262, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 37.16 UTILIZATION ANALYSIS.
   (A)   Upon being supplied by the Director of Personnel for city employment a
list and specific characterization of each job category in city employment, the
EEO Officer shall conduct a detailed and specific utilization analysis of
minorities and females within the city’s labor/employment force and within the
area labor/employment force, and a detailed analysis of minority residents of
the city. The collection and analysis of data required for this affirmative
action plan shall be carried out within 60 days after adoption of the plan.
   (B)   The utilization analysis described in division (A) above shall
include, although not be limited to, 5 stages.
      (1)   Determination of the characteristics of the work force within the
city’s labor area;
      (2)   Analysis of the requirements relating to a city job description;
      (3)   Based on the analysis in division (B)(2) above a determination of
the availability of minorities and women for employment within that category;
      (4)   Analysis of the ethnic and gender data of the current work force of
city employment by job category and individual department; and
      (5)   A designation of any job category as “deficient” if the percentage
of minorities or women employed by the city and qualified for the deficient
category exceeds the percentage of minorities and women employed in that
category.
(1979 Code, § 37.11) (Ord. 3262, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 37.17 REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN.
   (A)   (1)   Upon the determination of what job categories within city
employment are “deficient,” as provided in §
37.16, with respect to proper utilization of minorities and women, the EEO
Officer shall submit a report to the Mayor.
      (2)   Thereafter, the EEO Officer, in a concerted effort with the
Director of Civil Rights, shall prepare a remedial action plan, consisting of
realistic and reasonable time objectives which will effectuate a proper
utilization of minorities and women in city employment.
   (B)   The primary goal is to establish and maintain an overall minority and
female percentage of city employment which reflects the percentage of
minorities and females within the city’s area labor force. When identified
deficiencies exist, first priority will be given to qualified minorities and
females presently employed by the city as vacancies occur within the deficient
categories. When vacancies in deficient categories cannot be filled from
present city employees, qualified minorities or women will be sought from
outside the city staff.
(1979 Code, § 37.12) (Ord. 3262, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 37.18 NUMERICAL GOALS.
   For deficiencies identified, as provided in §§
37.16 and
37.17, numerical goals for a term of 1 year shall be set, accompanied by a
description of specific procedures to implement these goals. The goal should be
stated as a percentage of the total employees in that job group and must be
equal to the percentage of minorities and women available and qualified for
that job group.
(1979 Code, § 37.13) (Ord. 3262, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 37.19 TIME PERIODS.
   Short-term goals for the affirmative action plan shall be set in such a
manner as to reach the ultimate objective within a minimum of 6 months. The
remedial action plan shall be submitted to the Mayor for final approval. The
activities described herein shall be carried out within 60 days.

§ 37.20 REVIEW OF REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN.
   One year after the approval of a remedial action plan, and annually
thereafter, the EEO Officer in conjunction with the Civil Rights Director,
shall conduct a review of the remedial action plan and shall amend the plan
where it is deemed appropriate. Any amendment shall be submitted to the Mayor
and the Council.

   (A)   All selection procedures (including written, performance or oral test,
education and experience ratings, structure interviews, reference vouchers and
application forms) shall be administered and utilized in such a manner as to
prevent discrimination. In order to insure that all selection devices are

   (A)   General scope; time limitation.
      (1)   Any employee of the city may utilize this grievance procedure when
alleging that there has been a violation.
      (2)   This grievance procedure is to be used by the employee who may have
a complaint in connection with his or her employment situation which is due to
discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, race, color, national
origin, age, sex, religion or handicap.
      (3)   An employee may file directly with the Department of Labor, Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or the Indiana Civil Rights Commission if he
or she believes he or she has been discriminated against on the basis of race,
color or national origin.
   (B)   Preliminary hearing. If an employee feels he or she has a grievance,
then the employee shall request a meeting with the department head or with the
EEO Officer for discussion and assistance. If, as a result of this preliminary
meeting, the employee wishes or has been advised to file a grievance complaint,
the department head or EEO Officer shall assist in preparing a written
complaint, as requested by the employee. The written complaint shall be filed
at the office of the EEO Officer to institute the grievance procedure.
   (C)   Informal hearing.
      (1)   A conference shall be scheduled and must take place within 30 days
from the date a grievance is filed. The purpose of the conference will be to
resolve the grievance complaint to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. A
written record of this conference shall be made and a copy thereof provided to
any party upon request.
      (2)   When the complaint involves discrimination, an investigation of the
circumstances described in the grievance complaint shall be conducted prior to
the conference, and a written report of the findings shall be made and

hearing.
      (3)   The impartial hearing officer will be an attorney selected by
mutual agreement of the complainant and the department head of the department
out of which the complaint arose. In the event the complainant and the
department head are unable to agree on an impartial hearing officer within 5
days of the date for request for formal hearing, the request for hearing shall
be forwarded by the EEO Director to the Civil Rights Commission for action. The
refusal of the Civil Rights Commission to conduct a hearing under these
circumstances shall terminate the employee’s right to a hearing by an impartial
hearing officer.
      (4)   The impartial hearing officer shall schedule and conduct a formal
hearing within 30 days but not less than 10 days after the delivery of request
for formal hearing by the complainant. Whether a case is to be presented to the

showing that the bidder is in existence, current with the Indiana Secretary of
State's Business Entity Reports, and eligible for a certificate of good
standing. If the bidder is an individual, sole proprietor or partnership, this
division shall not apply;
         (b)   A list identifying all former business names within the last 10
years;
         (c)   Any determinations by a court or governmental agency for
violations of federal, state, or local laws including, but not limited to
violations of contracting or antitrust laws, tax or licensing laws,
environmental laws, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA);
         (d)   Evidence of participation in apprenticeship training programs
applicable to the work to be performed on the project which are approved by and
registered with the United States Department of Labor's Office of
Apprenticeship, or its successor organization. The required evidence includes,
but may not limited to, evidence that each apprenticeship program has graduated
at least 5 apprentices in each of the past 5 years;
         (e)   The name and description of the experience of each of the
bidder's project managers and superintendents that bidder intends to assign to
work on the project;
         (f)   A statement that all employees of the bidder who will perform
work on the public works project will be in compliance with any drug testing
requirements set forth in I.C. 4-13-18-5 or I.C. 4-14-18-6;
         (g)   Proof of any professional or trade license required by law for
any trade or specialty area in which bidder is seeking a contract award; and
disclosure of any suspension or revocation within the previous 5 years of any
professional or trade license held by the company, or of any director, office
or manager employed by the bidder;
         (h)   A written statement of any federal, state or local tax liens or
tax delinquencies owed to any federal, state or local taxing body in the last 5
years;
         (i)   A statement that individuals who will perform work on the public
works project on behalf of the bidder will be properly classified as either (i)
an employee or (ii) an independent contractor, under all applicable state and
federal laws and local ordinances;
         (j)   For contracts estimated to cost at least $300,000, certification
that all contractors and subcontractors are qualified under I.C. 4-13.4 or I.C.

         (k)   A completed Contractor's Bid for Public Works - Form 96 (latest
revision) prescribed by the State Board of Accounts, which includes a list of
projects completed within the last year or currently under construction and a
list of names and addresses of all subcontractors from whom the bidder intends
to hire on any part of the public works project.
      (2)   The city reserves the right to demand supplemental information from
the bidder, additional verification of any of the information provided by the
bidder, and may conduct random inquiries of the bidder's current and prior
customers.
   (B)   Post-bid submissions from subcontractors.
      (1)   Each subcontractor, of any tier, and regardless of the subcontract
bid amount, shall be required to adhere to the requirements of division (A)
above as though it were bidding directly to the city. Subcontractors shall
submit the required information to the successful bidder, who shall then
forward said information to the city prior to the subcontractor's first day of
work on the public works project.
      (2)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default and/or breach by the successful
bidder. However, payment shall be withheld from any subcontractor who fails to
timely submit said information until such information is submitted and approved
by the city. Additionally, the city may require the successful bidder and/or
relevant subcontractor to remove a subcontractor from the project and replace
it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor.
      (3)   The disclosure of a subcontractor ("disclosed subcontractor") by a
bidder or a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the disclosed
subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another
subcontractor ("substitute subcontractor") for a disclosed subcontractor by
giving the city written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the
substitute subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is subject to all of the
obligations of a subcontractor under this section.
   (C)   Validity of pre-qualification classification.
      (1)   When pre-qualification is required by the city, as specified within
the project bidding documents, upon designation by the city that a contractor's
or subcontractor's submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely,
and upon any further consideration deemed necessary by the city, the contractor
or subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future city public works projects. A
contractor's classification as "qualified" shall exempt the contractor or sub-
contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements contained herein for
a period of 12 months.
      (2)   Any material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must
be replied in writing within 10 days of its occurrence to the city. The pre-
qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the city and the
city specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a
stated written reason(s).
      (3)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be
forwarded to the contractor within 7 working days of such decision. Any
contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status may request
reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the
city within 5 business days of receipt of notice of denial.
   (D)   Incomplete submissions by bidders. It is the sole responsibility of
the bidder to comply with all submission requirements herein no later than the
public bid opening. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by
the city shall result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.
   (E)   Projects in good standing. All projects the bidder currently has under
contract with the city shall be in good standing. A responsive and responsible
bidder shall have no city contract that is currently past contractual time
limits, or assessed liquidated damages for any reason. The city may, through
its City Engineer and Board of Public Works, in its sole discretion, classify a
bidder non-responsible and disqualify a bidder for a period up to 2 years after
liquidated damage is assessed.
   (F)   Responsive and responsible bidder determination. After its review of
complete and timely submissions, taking into account all information in the
submission requirements, the city shall in its sole discretion determine
whether a bidder or subcontractor is responsive and responsible. The city
reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the bidder or
subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by the city through its
own independent verification of the information provided.
   (G)   Certified payroll.
      (1)   When requested by the city, for projects in which the cost is at
least $150,000, the successful bidder and all subcontractors working on a
public works project shall submit a certified payroll report utilizing federal
form WH-347 or its successor form, which must be prepared on a weekly basis and
submitted to the city within 10 calendar days after the end of each week in
which the successful bidder or subcontractor performed on the public works
project. Certified payroll reports shall identify the job title and craft of
each employee on the project, e.g. journeyman electrician or apprentice
electrician. In the event any successful bidder or subcontractor uses
independent contractors to perform work on the project, such individual must be
identified on the federal form WH-347 or successor form with the same
information as is required for employees.
      (2)   The city shall not withhold payment to a successful bidder or
subcontractor for failure of the successful bidder or 1 or more other
subcontractors to timely submit their certified payroll reports, unless federal
or state funds are withheld from the city due to failure to submit certified
payroll.
   (H)   Public records. All information submitted by a bidder or a
subcontractor pursuant to this section, including certified payrolls, are
public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public
Records law (I.C. 5-14-3).
   (I)   Penalties for false, deceptive, or fraudulent statements/information.
Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false,
deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or
fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the city shall
be disqualified from bidding on all city projects for a period of 3 years.
(Ord. 5890, passed 2-14-2022)
§ 39.07 ADVANCED PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS.
   (A)   A purchasing agent of a board or commission of the city may allow

part of a public works project, consistent with and to the extent permitted by
law and the purchasing policies of the city.
   (B)   A solicitation for a public works contract which provides for advance

measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements
to allow access to representatives of the Board.
      (2)   Facility operators shall grant access to the Board, or its
designated representatives, all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that are kept under
the conditions of an NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties
as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   On any NPDES-permitted facility, the Board shall have the right to

shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
discharger.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Board, or its designated
representatives, access to a permitted facility are a violation of a storm
water discharge permit and of this subchapter. A person who is the operator of
a facility with a NPDES permit associated with industrial activity violates
this subchapter if the person denies the Board, or its designated
representatives, reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
      (6)   If the Board, or its designated representative, has been refused
access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and
the Board or its designated representative is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that
there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter, or to
protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then
the Board may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (C)   Sampling and monitoring. The Board has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary at any commercial or
industrial facility or any facility containing more than 3 residential units.
The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.

§ 50.35 RIGHT TO ENTER PREMISES.
   (A)   Reasons for entry. The Board, or the designated representatives of the
Board, shall have the right to enter any premises for any of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Investigate a suspected spill or discharge into the storm drainage
system;
      (2)   To carry out routine inspections;
      (3)   To carry out routine sampling; or
      (4)   To verify compliance with any agreed order, order of the Board, or
order of any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   Refusal to grant access. If the Board, or its representative, has been
refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged
and the Board, or its representative, is able to reasonably demonstrate to a
court of competent jurisdiction within Elkhart County that there may be a
violation of this subchapter or that there is a need to inspect or sample as
part of the Board's routine inspection and sampling program, the court shall
grant an order allowing the Board, or its representative, access to all
relevant parts of a premises.

for the emergency response of a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm
drainage system, or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
      (1)   In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services.
      (2)   In the event of such a release of any other type of materials, said
person shall notify the Department in person or by telephone or facsimile no
later than the next business day.

(Ord. 5012, passed 2-5-2007; Am. Ord. 5246, passed 1-24-2011)
§ 50.58 RATE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION.
   (A)   There is hereby assessed a storm water user fee to each owner of
residential real estate and non-residential real estate located within the
corporate boundaries of the city which contain impervious area in an amount
based upon the assigned ERU as determined below. Such storm water user fees
shall be calculated and assessed on a tax parcel basis by key number.
   (B)   Except as otherwise stated in this subchapter, all real estate having
impervious area within the corporate boundaries of the city will be assigned an
ERU in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Residential real estate. A tax parcel containing a single dwelling
unit shall be 1 ERU. A tax parcel containing 2 or 3 dwelling units shall also
be assigned 1 ERU. All other tax parcels containing more than 3 dwelling units
shall be assigned an ERU value based upon the parcel's individually measured
impervious area in square feet divided by 3,600 square feet. This division will
be calculated and rounded to 1 decimal place.
      (2)   Non-residential real estate. Each tax parcel of non-residential
real estate shall be assigned an ERU based upon the parcel's individually
measured impervious area in square feet divided by 3,600 square feet. This
division will be calculated and rounded to one decimal place. However, the
assessment for any non-residential tax parcel with a calculated annual storm
water user fee equal to or less than $2.25 will be waived.
      (3)   The identification of real estate tax parcels and key numbers, the
classification of primary use, the determination of whether a tax parcel
contains a dwelling, the number of dwellings a tax parcel contains, the
classification of the type of dwelling unit and type of real estate, shall be
based upon the existing data in the Elkhart County computer-assisted mass
appraisal system (CAMA) database for the respective determination date used for
making the storm water user fee assessments. The calculation of the
individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel shall be computed using a
scale of 1:600, based upon the existing data in the Elkhart County geographic
information system (GIS) database for the respective determination date used
for making the storm water user fee assessments. If, for any reason, the
calculation of the individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel cannot
be accurately computed using a scale of 1:600, based upon the existing data in
the Elkhart County GIS database for the respective determination date, the
calculation of the individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel shall
be computed in the following order of priority:
         (a)   Using a scale of 1:600, based upon the existing data in the most
recent Elkhart County GIS database prior to the respective determination date
used for making the storm water user fee assessments; or
         (b)   Based upon the existing data in the Elkhart County CAMA system
database for the respective determination date used for making the storm water
user fee assessments.
      The individually measured impervious area on a tax parcel computed in
accordance with the provisions above may be adjusted, based upon the data from
any permitted construction, additions, demolitions, and other changes on a tax
parcel which occur after the date of the aerial photography utilized in the
Elkhart County GIS database, or based upon the actual verified conditions on
the tax parcel, or both.
      (4)   For each current year storm water user fee assessment, the
determination date shall be March 1st of the prior year.
   (C)   There shall be no exceptions or exemptions from the assignment of ERUs
and the assessment of storm water user fees for a particular type or
classification of real estate tax parcel within the corporate boundaries of the
city.

§ 50.59 COLLECTION OF STORM WATER USER FEES.
   (A)   The collection of the storm water user fees authorized by this
subchapter shall be effectuated through a charge appearing each year on the
property tax statements of the affected property owner. One-half of the storm
water user fees charged each year for a real estate tax parcel shall be billed
on each of the spring and fall property tax statements for that parcel. The
storm water user fee shall be due and payable at the same time as the property
taxes appearing on the spring and fall installment property tax statement. In
the event that only 1 property tax statement is billed for a real estate tax
parcel, the entire annual storm water user fee for that parcel shall be billed
on that property tax statement which shall be due and payable at the same time
as the property taxes appearing on the property tax statement are due and
payable.
   (B)   If the storm water user fee is not paid when due, a late payment
penalty shall be charged and assessed by the Elkhart County Treasurer in the
same way and in the same manner that delinquent property taxes are charged and
assessed.
   (C)   If storm water user fees and penalties are not paid when due, they
shall be collected by the Elkhart County Treasurer in the same way that
delinquent property taxes are collected.

   (A)   If, in the opinion of any user, the ERU assigned to the user's real
estate tax parcel is inaccurate in light of the number of dwellings or amount
of impervious area on the property, the user shall have the right to contest
the ERU determination and thus the storm water user fees assessed in accordance
with the provisions contained in this section.
   (B)   The user shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal storm water
assessment form which shall be filed with the Elkhart County MS4 Operator with
verifiable documentation supporting the user's claim. To be timely for any
current year storm water user fee assessment, a petition to appeal must be
filed no later than the date on which the storm water user fees shall be due
and payable. The Elkhart County MS4 Operator shall refer the petition to appeal
to the Advisory Board.
   (C)   The Advisory Board shall investigate the user's claim and, upon review
thereof, shall render a written determination that either the original ERU
determination and assessment should be affirmed or that the user's rate should
be adjusted and how much the adjustment should be.
   (D)   The determination made by the Advisory Board shall be forwarded to the
user by certified mail, return receipt requested. The user shall have 15 days
from date of receipt to request reconsideration if dissatisfied with the
decision from the Advisory Board. Any additional facts concerning the dispute
shall be reduced to writing and submitted, along with a copy of the original
petition and supporting documents, to the Elkhart County MS4 Operator. The
Elkhart County MS4 Operator shall refer the matter to the Storm Water Board.
The Advisory Board shall submit a written report of the determination in the
case, along with any documents used, in denying the user's claim or in
recommending an adjustment.
   (E)   Thereafter, the Storm Water Board shall review all documentation and
conduct an informal hearing to determine and resolve the dispute based upon the
documentation submitted and any oral testimony. The Storm Water Board shall
issue a determination which shall be binding upon the Department of Storm Water
Management and the user. The hearing shall be recorded and the minutes of the
hearing provided upon request at a cost per page as determined by the Secretary
for the Storm Water Board which rate shall be amended from time to time.
   (F)   Any user aggrieved by the final Storm Water Board determination shall
have the right to judicial review of such determination in accordance with
state law.
   (G)   If a user's storm water assessment is reduced or eliminated by the
Advisory Board, the Storm Water Board, or court of law, the user shall be
refunded accordingly for any overpayment made from the earlier of the date the
storm water user fee assessment was paid or was due and payable.
   (H)   A dispute or appeal of an ERU determination for storm water assessment
shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the originally assessed storm
water user fee.
(Ord. 5012, passed 2-5-2007)
§ 50.61 STORM WATER UTILITY FUND.
   All storm water user fees and penalties collected and interest earned

pretreatment requirement. The Director may also issue a cease and desist order
if the user has failed to meet the terms and conditions of an issued consent
order or if the user's past violations are likely to reoccur. The Director may
issue such an order directing the user to cease all such violations. The user
shall nrrmediately comply with all requirements and take such appropriate
remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation. That may include halting operations or terminating the
discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      (5)   Show cause.
         (a)   Order to show cause. The Board may issue a written order to show
cause to any user who violates or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a permit, order issued hereunder, or any other applicable pretreatment
requirement. The order to show cause shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail or equivalent, return receipt requested, upon the
user or the user's duly authorized representative. The order to show cause
shall describe the noncompliance and the proposed enforcement action. The order
to show cause shall also specify the place where a written response shall be
filed and the date by which it shall be filed. In addition, the order to show
cause should indicate that:

disputed; the written response should include a statement that the user intends
to comply with the order. The response shall address each violation in the
order to show cause and describe the steps that the user intends to take to
address the violation. The Director shall review the user's written response
and shall notify the user within 30 calendar days after the written response is
received whether the response is satisfactory. If the Director determines that
the written response is satisfactory, the matter shall not be scheduled for
hearing. However, if the Director determines that the written response is
unsatisfactory, then the matter shall be scheduled for a hearing before the
Board. Failure to respond shall be a violation of this chapter.
            2.   If the allegations of the order to show cause are disputed,
the user shall submit a written request for a hearing before the Board. The
President of the Board shall then issue a notice setting forth the date, time
and place of the hearing and shall serve the notice upon the user in the same
manner as prescribed for service of the order to show cause.

wastewater service or suspension or revocation of a permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate all discharges. In an emergency, the order to cease discharge
may be given by telephone, followed by written confirmation of such notice. In
non-emergency situations, an administrative order may be used to suspend or
terminate wastewater service. If the user fails to comply with the suspension
or termination order, the city shall take all steps as deemed necessary to halt
the discharge including immediate severance of the wastewater connection.
         (b)   The Board shall not reinstate the permit or the wastewater
service until proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge and any
costs for disconnection and reconnection of wastewater service have been paid
by the user.
      (7)   Publication of violations. The Director shall, at least annually,
publish in the newspaper of general circulation, having the largest circulation
within the city, a list of the users that were in significant noncompliance at
any time during the previous 12 months.

sustained by the city as a result of noncompliance. The Corporation Counsel may
commence an action for appropriate legal and equitable relief in the
appropriate court of Elkhart County in order to obtain remedies for
noncompliance by the user.
      (2)   When the Director finds that a user has violated any terms of their
permit, this chapter, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the city may petition the court for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction. The injunction would compel the specific performance of
the user to be in compliance with the permit, order, or other requirement
imposed by this chapter. The Director may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user
to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a
user.
   (C)   Affirmative defenses.
      (1)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions of this chapter, if the user can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
         (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
         (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
      (2)   Bypass.
         (a)   For the purposes of this section:
            1.   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
            2.   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
         (b)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (c) and (d) of this section.
         (c)   Bypass notifications.
            1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user
shall submit prior notice to the Director, at least 10 calendar days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
            2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within 5 calendar days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
         (d)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(2)
(c) of this section.
         (e)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in divisions (C)(2)(b), (c) and (d)of this section.
      (3)   Upset.
         (a)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
         (b)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence, the following facts:
            1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the
upset;
            2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
manner and in compliance with applicable O & M procedures; and
            3.   The user has submitted the following information to the
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five calendar
days:
               a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
               b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue; and
               c.    Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance.
         (d)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         (e)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
         (f)   Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.12 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   A user who falls within a regulated industrial subcategory shall comply with
the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards (40 C.F.R §§ 405-471, as
amended from time to time) for that particular industrial subcategory. If the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards are less stringent than the state
pretreatment standards or local pollutant limitations applicable to the user,
the user shall comply with the more stringent standards. The National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards (Title 40 C.F.R. §§ 405-471), as amended
from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with
§
52.16.
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e).
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.13 STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   A user shall comply with state pretreatment standards (327 IAC 5-18-8, as
amended from time to time) applicable to the user. If the state pretreatment
standards are less stringent than the national pretreatment standards or local
pollutant limitations applicable to the user, the user shall comply with the
more stringent standards. The state pretreatment standards, as amended from
time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)

      7.0 mg/L   chromium
      4.2 mg/L   zinc
   (B)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal
unless indicated otherwise. The control authority may impose mass limitations
in addition to the concentration-based limitations above.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019; Am. Ord. 5799, passed 4-6-2020)
§ 52.15 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Director may develop BMPs, by ordinance or in individual wastewater
discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of §§
52.10 and
52.11.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.16 EQUIVALENT MASS LIMITS.
   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the control
authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Director. The control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if
the industrial user meets all the conditions listed in divisions (A) and (B) of
this section.
   (A)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
      (1)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
      (2)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
      (3)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
      (4)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
      (5)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
   (B)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
      (1)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies
adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
      (2)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
      (3)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from
its baseline production rates determined in division (A)(3) of this section.
Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Director will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
      (4)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (A)(1) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
   (C)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director:
      (1)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual
average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by
the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
      (2)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
      (3)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual
wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
52.18. The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
52.18 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (D)   The Director may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. §§ 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director.
   (E)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (F)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify 1 limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (G)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Director within 2 business days after the user has a reasonable
basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the
next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of such anticipated
change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit
that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production
rate.

§ 52.17 CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or permit, more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW and storm water
conveyance system if the city deems it necessary in order to comply with the
objectives of this chapter.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.18 DILUTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any other
way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment requirement or
standard.
   (B)   Unpolluted water, including, but not limited to, city water, non-
contact cooling water, or blowdown shall not be discharged to the POTW for
purposes of diluting wastewater in order to reduce sewer rates or charges of
the user.

§ 52.19 INTERCEPTORS, SEPARATORS AND TRAPS.
   (A)   Control devices such as interceptors, separators, and traps shall be
installed at all food service establishments as required in §§
52.65 through
52.71 as amended and at all industrial or commercial user's facilities when, in
the opinion of the Director, the control device is necessary to contain fat,
oil, grease, sand, or other harmful inert materials in the user's wastewater.
   (B)   The user shall be responsible for determining the appropriate size and
type of control device to be used at their facility only for oil separators.
   (C)   The control device shall be located as close to the source of fat,
oil, grease or sand laden waters as possible. The placement of the control
device shall allow the cover to be visible at all times and easily removable
for cleaning. Clearances shall be such that with the cover removed, the
internal baffling can be serviced and ail wetted surfaces are visible.
   (D)   Each control device shall be clearly labeled on the cover. The label
should identify the type of device such as "grease trap", "oil separator", or
"sand interceptor".
   (E)   The control device shall be regularly pumped or cleaned and maintained
with maintenance and disposal records maintained onsite and available for
inspection. Records shall be retained onsite for a minimum of 3 years.

§ 52.20 CONTROL MANHOLE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All non-residential users who own, operate, or maintain a commercial
or industrial facility connected to the POTW who make a new connection or
modify an existing connection to the POTW shall install a control manhole
unless the Director determines that a control manhole is not required.
   (B)   Additionally, the Director shall have the authority to require any
user, at the user's expense, to install a control manhole if determined that
such manhole is necessary to protect the POTW.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.21 LIMITATIONS ON POINT OF DISCHARGE.
   No person shall discharge any waste, wastewater, pollutant or other
substance directly into a manhole or other opening in the POTW other than
through the approved sewer lateral, except in accordance with the terms of this
chapter or by express written permission of the Director.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.22 REGULATION OF WASTE RECEIVED FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS.
   (A)   If another public entity located outside of the city's sewer service
area, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the control authority shall enter
into an inter-local agreement with the contributing public entity.
   (B)   Prior to entering into an inter- local agreement required by division

   (A)   Slug discharge prevention/control plan.
      (1)   Each significant industrial user (SIU) shall provide protection
from spills or slug discharges. The Director shall determine if a slug
discharge control plan is required by an SIU. An SIU that is required to have a
slug discharge control plan shall implement the plan and not commence
discharging to the POTW until the plan has been submitted to the Director. The
Director's review of such plan, including any facilities and operating
procedures, shall not relieve the SIU from the responsibility to modify such
plan as necessary to maintain compliance with applicable federal, state, and
local regulations. In addition, the submission of such plan to the Director
shall not relieve the SIU of its responsibility to comply with all other laws
and regulations governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous
substances. The SIU shall provide and maintain all facilities needed to
implement the plan.
      (2)   The slug discharge control plan may be part of an SIU's existing
contingency plan, emergency response plan, or spill plan developed under other
federal, state or local regulations. At a minimum, the following elements shall
be part of the submitted plan:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals, including chemical name, amount
stored and storage location;
         (c)   Notification procedures, in accordance with division (B) of this
section, for immediately notifying the POTW of spills or slug discharges,
including any discharge prohibited by this chapter.
         (d)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impacts from slug
discharges or spills, including, but not limited to, the following;
            1.   Inspection and maintenance of storage areas;
            2.   Handling and transfer of materials;
            3.   Loading and unloading operations;
            4.   Control of plant site runoff;
            5.   Worker training;
            6.   Building of containment structures or equipment;
            7.    Measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including
solvents; and
            8.    Measures and equipment for emergency responses.
      (3)   Such plans shall be revised and updated whenever plant operational
changes affect the validity of the plans, but in any case, not less often than
every three years. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in
administrative enforcement as defined in §
52.06(A). Any significant plan revisions, including revisions involving
construction of new facilities, shall be submitted to the Director prior to
implementation of such revisions.
      (4)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
SIU's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in
the event of a spill or slug discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause such a spill or slug discharge to occur are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   (B)   Reports of spills, slug discharges and operation upsets.
      (1)   Oral notice. The user shall notify the city's Public Works and
Utilities Department by telephone within 15 minutes of becoming aware of any
spill, slug discharge, or operation upset. The notification shall include all
information known at that time, including, but not limited to location and
duration of the discharge, type of waste, including concentration, pH, volume
and corrective actions.
      (2)   Written notice.
         (a)   Within 5 working days following such an incident, the user shall
submit to the Director a detailed written report signed by the user describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent

specified in an SIU's industrial wastewater discharge permit and shall be
accompanied by a certification statement that shall be signed as required in §
52.41(B)(3)(c).
      (1)   Re-sampling requirement. If sampling performed by the SIU indicates
a violation, the SIU shall notify the Director within 24 hours after becoming
aware of the violation. The SIU shall repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 calendar
days after notification unless a shorter time is specified by the Director.
      (2)   Additional self-monitoring. If an SIU monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Director, using procedures established by 40
C.F.R. § 136, the SIU shall include the results of this monitoring in the
report .
   (B)   Baseline monitoring report. Upon promulgation of a new or revised
national categorical pretreatment standard, all affected industrial users shall
submit the following reports to the Director on forms provided by the Director:
      (1)   Within 180 calendar days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, existing sources subject to such categorical
pretreatment standards who are currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit a report containing the
information listed in division (B)(3) of this section;
      (2)   At least 90 calendar days prior to commencement of discharge to the
POTW, new
sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation
of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be required to submit
a report which contains the information listed in divisions (B)(3)(a) through
(e) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this
report information on the method of pretreatment the industrial user intends to
use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates
of the information requested in divisions (B)(3)(d) and (e) of this section;
      (3)   The baseline monitoring report shall contain the following
information;
         (a) Identifying information. The industrial user shall submit the name
and address of the facility including the name of the owner and operator;
         (b)   Applicable permits. The industrial user shall submit a list of
any other environmental control permits held by the owner or operator of the
facility;
         (c)   Description of operations. The industrial user shall submit a
brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard
industrial classification of the operations performed by such industrial user.
This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
         (d)   Flow measurement. The industrial user shall submit information
showing the measured average and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the
POTW from each regulated process stream;
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process;
            2.   In addition, the industrial user shall submit the results of
required sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration or mass
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Where
required, both the daily maximum and the average concentration or mass shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations;
            3.   A minimum of 4 grab sampling events shall occur. All samples
shall be properly collected and analyzed for pH, cyanide, phenol, FOG, and
volatile organics;
            4.   For all other pollutants at facilities in which historical
sampling data do not exist, a minimum of four 24-hour composite samples shall
be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques. The
Director may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user
that demonstrates that flow- proportional sampling is not feasible. In such
cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of 4 grab samples over a period greater than 1
hour, where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. At facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower
minimum;
            5.   The industrial user shall take a minimum of 1 representative
sample to compile data necessary to comply with the requirements of this
division (B)(3)(e);
            6.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from a
pretreatment facility if such a facility exists or immediately downstream from

does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the Director determines that the sampling and analytical
techniques described in 40 C.F.R § 136, are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, then sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
approved by the Director;
            8.   The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; and
            9.   The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date
and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected
pollutant discharges to the POTW.
         (f)   Certification statement. The industrial user shall submit a
statement certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis. If pretreatment
standards are not being met, then the certification statement shall specify
whether additional O & M or additional pretreatment is required for the
industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment or O & M are
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall provide
a compliance schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional
pretreatment or O & M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later
than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
The conditions contained in §
52.27 shall apply to the schedule required by this section; and
         (h)   Other. Industrial users shall submit any other information
required as listed in 40 C.F.R. §§ 403.12(b)(1) through (7).
   (C)   90-day compliance report. Within 90 calendar days following the date

the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment
standards and pretreatment requirements shall submit to the Director a report
containing the information described in §
52.41. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production or other measure of operation, this report shall include the
industrial user's actual quantity of product produced during the appropriate
sampling period.
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports. Except as specified in §
52.43, all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the
Director, submit no less than twice per year reports indicating the nature,
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the
user must submit documentation required by the Director or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the SIU.
   (E)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Director as the Director may require.
   (F)   Signatory requirements and report certification.

§ 52.43 SAMPLING WAIVER.
   Pursuant to 40 C.F.R.§ 403.12 and this chapter, the Director may authorize
an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego
sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the
industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
   (A)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater;
   (B)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective
period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer
than 5 years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the
waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit. See §
52.41(B)(1)(s);
   (B)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least 1 sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes;
   (D)   Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.6, the request for a monitoring waiver
must be signed in accordance with §
52.42(F) , and include the certification statement in §
52.41(B)(3)(c);
   (E)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that
a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. § 136 with
the lowest minimum detection level for that Pollutant was used in the analysis;
   (F)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director must be included as
a condition in the SIU's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Director for 3 years after expiration of the waiver;
   (G)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the Director, the industrial user must certify on each report with
the statement in §
52.42(F), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the industrial user;
   (H)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of §
52.42(D), or other more frequent monitoring requirements, and notify the
Director; and
   (I)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (J)   Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on this section must certify on each report with the
following statement that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the user.
      "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR [specify
applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since
filing of the last periodic report under §
52.42(D)."
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.44 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Measurement of SIU industrial waste flow. Any significant industrial
user who is discharging industrial waste to the POTW shall provide to the
Director independent access and the means and facilities for observing,
measuring and sampling such industrial waste. The Director shall have full
access at all times to the SIU's monitoring facility or facilities to conduct
tests on quality and quantity of effluent. The volume or quantity of industrial
waste discharged by any industrial user into the POTW may be determined by one
or more of the following methods:
      (1)   If the entire volume of water used by an SIU is purchased from the
city, then the volume of water purchased from the city shall be considered to
be the volume of industrial waste discharged;
      (2)   If the entire volume of water used by an SIU is purchased from the
city and the volume of water used for industrial purposes is less than the
volume of water purchased from the city, the SIU shall either install and
maintain a meter on the industrial waste line; or use another method approved
by the Director to determine the volume of industrial waste discharged; or
      (3)   If any SIU now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial
waste to the POTW and does not purchase its entire water supply from the city,
then the volume or quantity of industrial wastes discharged by an SIU shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   The SIU shall install and maintain a meter or meters on all
private water supply lines. The volume of industrial waste discharged shall be
considered the sum of the volume of water purchased from the city and the
volume of water metered from the private water supply; or
         (b)   The SIU shall install and maintain a meter on the industrial
waste line to determine the volume of industrial waste discharged.
   (B)   Measurement of other non-residential flow. If any other non-
residential user now discharging or proposing to discharge to the POTW and does
not purchase its entire water supply from the city, then the volume or quantity
of wastewater discharged by the non-residential user may be determined by one
of the methods listed in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Location of monitoring facilities. The Director may require an
industrial user to provide and operate, at its own expense, monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the user's
industrial waste. The monitoring facility shall be located on the industrial
user's premises unless the Director determines that such a location would be
impractical for purposes of providing independent and unscheduled monitoring
activities or causes undue hardship on the industrial user. In such cases, with
the Director's approval, the monitoring facility may be constructed in the
public right-of-way or easement, in an unobstructed location. The location of
the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The industrial user shall maintain its monitoring facilities and sampling and
measuring equipment in safe and proper operating condition. Whether constructed
on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the Director's requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Such facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in a manner to enable the Director to perform independent
monitoring activities.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.45 EFFLUENT METERS.
   Industrial and commercial users may be required to use a utility approved
effluent meter to determine the flow of wastewater entering the POTW.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the user to allow the utility to access
the meter.
   (B)   It is the responsibility of the user to maintain the meter in working
order. If the meter is not maintained in proper working order (e.g. chronic
failure), the user shall be required to install a new meter. Chronic failure
shall be defined as failure at least 3 times in a 24-month period.
   (C)   Failure to repair or replace a meter within 30 days or as approved by
the Director shall subject the user to penalties as outlined in the Enforcement
Response Plan Penalty Matrix.
   (D)   Meters shall be installed at a location that allows access to the
meter from floor level, without the use of a ladder or other similar device and
that will not subject the device to excessive heat or freezing.
(Ord. 5746, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 52.46 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   Inspection.
      (1)   The Director may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the user is complying with the provisions and requirements of this
chapter. For categorical industrial users, the Director shall perform a minimum
of 1 scheduled and 1 unscheduled inspection each calendar year. For all non-
categorical industrial users, the Director may perform a minimum of 1
inspection each calendar year.
      (2)   Upon request by the Director, users shall allow the Director and
the approval authority access to all parts of the premises within a reasonable
time frame as determined by the Director for the purpose of ensuring compliance
with this chapter. The Director and the approval authority shall have the right
to enter onto a user's property to set up such devices as are necessary to
sample, inspect, monitor or meter operations of the user to determine
compliance with this chapter. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its
property, the user shall make necessary arrangements so that upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Director and the approval authority shall be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
      (3)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director and the approval
authority access to the User's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. The Director may obtain a search warrant from a court
of competent jurisdiction when the Director has been refused access to a
building, structure, property, or any part thereof. The Director must be able
to demonstrate that a user is violating any provision of this chapter or as
part of a routine inspection and sampling program, needs to inspect or sample
to verify compliance with this chapter or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community.
   (C)   Sample analyses.
      (1)   All analyses, including sampling results submitted in support of
any application, reports, evidence, or required by any permit or order, shall
be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. § 136,
as amended. If 40 C.F.R. § 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and
analytical procedures approved by the Director.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
Discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
calibrated, properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.

jurisdiction against the registered owner of the vehicle charging the person
with a violation of one or more of the provisions of this chapter, that owner
shall, upon conviction, pay the court costs of the proceeding and be fined not
more than $50 for each violation. All fines shall, pursuant to the terms of the

that all dogs of nonresidents shall at the time of entry into the city be
properly vaccinated against rabies, and while kept within the city, meet all
other requirements of this chapter. Any owner claiming any of these exemptions
has the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that
the dog or cat in question is entitled to such exemption.
   (G)   Penalties.  
      (1)   Any owner of a dog or cat over the age of 6 months who fails to

approved homes to the humane society or the city's designated agency and to
ensure homes are maintaining required standards of care. Furthermore, a foster
home may not foster more than 6 animals in foster care including their own

wants to be authorized to enter the dog park. An owner of a dog who pays the
dog park licensing fee will not be required to pay any other licensing fee
required in this section. Additionally, each owner of a dog will also pay a
membership fee of $25 per year for each dog the owner wants to be authorized to
have entry into the dog park.
      (2)   A non-resident may purchase an annual pass for $35 for authority to
enter and use the dog park. A non-resident may also purchase a three-day pass
for $5 for authority to enter and use the dog park. A non-resident is required
to provide written proof that his or her dog is up-to-date with its
vaccinations.
      (3)   (a)   Any dog that is already licensed by the city is not required
to be re-licensed in order to gain entry into the dog park as long as the dog
park membership fee is paid. Both the licensing and the membership fee
authorizing entry into the dog park are valid for one calendar year (January 1
to December 31) of the applicable year. Upon the lapsing or expiration of any
dog's license, entry into the dog park shall require the purchase of the $18
license tag and the $25 membership fee.
         (b)   For the calendar year 2017, the following applies: An owner of
any licensed dog may gain entry into the dog park by paying the membership fee.
Because the park is a new amenity in the City of Elkhart and will not be open
for a full calendar year in 2017, the membership fee which grants authority for
entry into the dog park will be reduced to $12 for city residents. The
membership fee for a non-resident shall be $22. This fee reduction only applies
to the calendar year 2017 and does not apply to any subsequent year regardless
of the date when the membership is purchased by the owner.
         (c)   Replacement fees are as follows: $5 for the park membership
swipe card, $10 for a lost tag.

section or some suitable place on the grounds.
   (E)   The subdivision of lots shall not be allowed, and joint purchases of a

FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
§ 94.001 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of §§
94.002 through
94.008, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM SYSTEM USER. Any individual, partnership, corporation or other form of
association upon whose property a security alarm or fire alarm is installed.
   COMMUNICATIONS CENTER. The Elkhart City Communications Center.
   FALSE ALARM. A security alarm or fire alarm signal eliciting the dispatch of
and response to the scene by police or fire assistance, whether or not the
signal is first transmitted to a second party monitoring agency, when there
exists no reasonably apparent evidence of a crime or threat of crime, fire or
threat of fire, or other circumstances that would warrant a call for immediate
police or fire assistance. FALSE ALARM does not include an alarm signal caused
by violent conditions of nature during known severe weather incidences as
reported by the National Weather Service and the city, rapid change in water
pressure induced by the city water management, or other extraordinary
circumstances beyond the control of the alarm user or the pre-arranged testing
and maintenance of alarm systems. In addition, it shall not be considered a
FALSE ALARM if, subsequent to the sounding of an alarm but prior to the arrival
of an officer, the Communications Center is notified that the alarm is of a
non-emergency nature, thereby “cancelling” the alarm.
   FIRE ALARM SYSTEM. Any system, device or mechanism designed to detect the
existence of and alert authorities to a fire, threat of fire, or other
circumstances that would warrant immediate fire assistance, upon the premises
protected by the system, whether activated manually or by sensors or other
techniques. FIRE ALARM SYSTEM, however, does not include “local alarms.”
   FIRE DEPARTMENT. The Elkhart City Fire Department.
   LOCAL ALARM. A device alerting only individuals located upon the premises
where the alarm is installed of a crime, threat of crime, fire, threat of fire
or other dangerous circumstances.
   POLICE DEPARTMENT. The Elkhart City Police Department.
   SECOND PARTY MONITORING AGENCY. Any private business providing an alarm
monitoring service to another person or entity, which business would, in the
event of an activated alarm, telephone or otherwise notify the appropriate
department to report said alarm. Alarm systems which utilize a second party
monitoring agency shall not be considered “local alarms.”
   SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM. Any system, device or mechanism designed to detect
the existence of and alert authorities to a crime, threat of crime or other
circumstances that would warrant immediate police assistance, upon the premises
protected by the system, whether activated manually or by sensors or other
techniques. SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM, however, does not include “local alarms.”
(1979 Code, § 94.01) (Ord. 4584, passed 5-7-2001)
§ 94.002 DUTIES OF ALARM USERS.
   An alarm user shall:
   (A)   Maintain the premises and any security or fire alarm system in a
manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarms;
   (B)   Review all security or fire alarm system operating instructions;
   (C)   Take reasonable action to ensure the Police Department or Fire
Department are notified of the non-emergency nature of a false alarm as soon as
the alarm user is aware of a false alarm; and
   (D)   Refrain from manually activating any security alarm or fire alarm
system except when needing an immediate police or fire response to an
emergency.
(1979 Code, § 94.02) (Ord. 4584, passed 5-7-2001)
Penalty, see § 94.999
§ 94.003 FALSE ALARM DETERMINATION PROCEDURE.
   Whenever a security alarm or fire alarm system is activated in the city and
results in the dispatch and arrival of the Police Department or the Fire
Department, the senior officer responding to the premises where the alarm
system is activated shall inspect the area protected by the system and shall
determine whether there exists reasonably apparent evidence of crime,
threatened crime, fire, threatened fire or other circumstances that would
warrant a call for immediate police or fire assistance. If the senior officer
determines there exists no such evidence, the officer shall make a false alarm
report by conveying the time, date, location and circumstances of the false
alarm to the Communications Center. The Communications Center shall maintain
records of false alarms and those records, when properly authenticated, shall
be presumptively valid as proof of the false alarm sounding in any ordinance
violation proceeding based thereon.
(1979 Code, § 94.03) (Ord. 4584, passed 5-7-2001)
Penalty, see § 94.999
§ 94.004 FALSE ALARMS UNLAWFUL.
   It is unlawful for an alarm user to sound a false alarm or permit a false
alarm to be sounded upon his or her property, whether by negligence or
otherwise. Upon each false alarm, the Communications Center shall notify the
property owner, in writing, that (1) a false alarm was sounded on his property,
(2) the time, date and type of alarm sounded, and (3) that false alarms in
excess of 6 calls per calendar year may result in the imposition of fines of
$50 to $400. Additionally, the Communications Center shall enclose educational
information to assist in minimizing future false alarms and subsequent fines.
Upon the seventh and any subsequent false alarm for any property within the
city, the Communications Center shall forward verification of such
circumstances to the Corporation Counsel or his or her designee, who shall
initiate appropriate legal action against the property owner.

and/or the determination that false alarms have occurred upon the premises.
      (2)   The owner may appeal the decision to impose fines by filing a
written objection with the Secretary of the Board of Safety within 30 days of
the date of the notice.
      (3)   The Secretary shall provide notice of the date of the hearing to
the owner and the office of the Corporation Counsel.
      (4)   The Board shall evaluate appeals based upon the totality of the
circumstances.
      (5)   A false alarm fine may be dismissed if the evidence does not
support a showing an alarm was false.
   (B)   In addition, mitigating factors which would support a reduction or
dismissal of the fine by the Board are:
      (1)   Adequate proof that the alarm system user has identified the cause
of the false alarm and taken appropriate remedial action to correct the defect
and prevent future alarms; and
      (2)   The extent that infirmity or disability of an alarm system user
contributed to the false alarm.
   (C)   (1)   Also, the first false alarm fine may be waived by the Board of
Safety upon a showing by the alarm user that the alarm system has been
inspected and certified to be in good working order by a professional provider.
      (2)   All false alarms not appealed to the Board of Safety within 30 days
shall be prosecuted in the Elkhart City Court.

PRIVATE FIRE ALARM AND BURGLAR ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 94.085 FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS.
   (A)   A privately owned fire alarm box (master box) at which an alarm may be
received and electrically conveyed to the Communication Center of the city may
be installed if, and only if, the installation and connection to the central
fire alarm system of the city is approved by the Fire Department of the city.
   (B)   These alarm boxes may be automatically activated by heat, smoke or a
sprinkling system or may be of another type specified by the Elkhart Fire
Department. The boxes may also be manually activated. The alarm box may be a
master box into which signals may be relayed from other boxes on the owner’s or
occupant’s premises, or may, with special permission granted only for proper
cause, be a single-station alarm system without a master box between the signal
system and the city system.
   (C)   A master box is that part of the alarm system of an owner’s or
occupant’s premises which, from the standpoint of electrical circuitry, is the
interface between the owner’s system and the city system, and ordinarily will
be a box which receives and transmits alarms from other signal boxes into the
city system. In some cases, however, the interface will not be a box receiving
signals from substations, but will be the box at which the original signal is
transmitted without going through a second box before reaching the city system,
and, for purposes of §§
94.085 through
94.092, the signal box is considered a master box.

connected to the Communication Center if, and only if, the connection to the
central alarm system of the city is approved by the Fire Department and Police
Department of the city.
   (B)   The city will furnish the console space in the Communication Center
for the purpose of connecting the private alarm system to the city’s system.
The city will also provide the electricity for the operation of the alarm
system within the Communication Center. No other labor or materials will be
provided by the city for the burglar alarm systems.
   (C)   (1)   The city will be responsible for monitoring the burglar alarm
systems connected to the central system within the Communication Center.
      (2)   This includes phoning the location with a code any time the alarm
activates, and dispatching a city or county police car, depending upon the
location.
      (3)   The city alarm operators will assist the private businesses that
are connected to the central alarm system in conducting tests of the private
alarm systems at least once a month.

person, firm or corporation on whose premises a master box is located or who
otherwise receives fire alarm or burglar alarm system services from the city.
      (1)   An installation charge of $200 which shall be paid by the owner of
the master box at the time of installation (in addition to the cost of the box
itself, which shall be the responsibility of the property owner or occupant).
The replacement of 1 box by another under circumstances which do not require a
new connection circuit to the Fire Department shall not result in a second
installation charge.
      (2)   A maintenance charge of $150 each calendar year to be invoiced by
the Fire Department to the owner or occupant on whose premises the box is
located, to be paid on or before January 31 of each year. The maintenance
charge for a fractional year, when a new box is installed during that year,
shall be prorated and based on the number of full calendar months remaining in
the calendar year, and shall be paid upon installation.
      (3)   A hook-up charge of $25 shall be paid by the owner of the burglar
alarm system at the time of the connection of the private system to the central
alarm system at the Communication Center.
      (4)   A monitoring fee of $200 per year shall be paid by the owners of
the fire alarm systems and $200 per year shall be paid by the owners of burglar
alarm systems that are connected to and monitored by the Communication Center.
This basic fee shall entitle the owners of the system to 1 status contact and
one control contact in the radio control master box. Any additional contacts
that the owners of the fire or burglar alarm systems wish to utilize shall be
charged at the rate of $10 per year per contact point. This fee shall be paid
to the city’s Communication Center Fund on or before January 31 of every year.
The monitoring fee for a fractional year shall be prorated and based on the
number of full calendar months remaining in such calendar year, and shall be
paid upon installation.

      (1)   A person seeking an event permit shall file an application with the
Board of Parks and Recreation (the "Board") on forms provided by the Board and
the application shall be signed by the applicant under oath.
      (2)   For single, non-recurring events, an application for a permit shall
be filed with the Board at least 10 and not more than 180 days before the event
is proposed to commence. The Board may waive the minimum 10-day filing period
and accept an application filed within a shorter period if, after due
consideration of the date, time, place and nature of the event, the anticipated
number of participants, and the city services required in connection with the
event, the Board determines that the waiver will not present a hazard to public
safety.
      (3)   For events held on a regular or recurring basis at the same
location, an application for a permit covering all such events during that
calendar year may be filed with the Board at least 60 and not more than 180
days before the date and time at which the first such event is proposed to
commence. The Board may waive the minimum 60-day period after due consideration
of the factors specified in division (B)(2) above.

information:

event;

         (g)   The location of the event and statement as to whether the event
will occupy all or only a portion of the park or park street;
         (h)   If the event is designed to be held by, or on behalf of, any
such person other than the applicant, the applicant for such permit shall file
a letter from that person with the Board authorizing the applicant to apply for
the permit on his or her behalf;

necessary to a fair determination as to whether a permit should issue.
   (C)   Police protection. The Board shall determine whether and to what
extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for
traffic control and public safety. The Board shall base this decision on the
size, location, duration, time and date of the event, the number of streets and
intersections blocked, and the need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use
of the streets and sidewalks. The speech content of the event shall not be a
factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary. If possible,

inform the applicant for the permit. The applicant then shall have the duty to
secure the police protection deemed necessary by the Chief of Police at the

required to pay for any police protection provided by the city.

assembly areas;

injury to persons or property;

services would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety
of persons and property;

certified mail at least 5 days prior to the event of its action and state the
reason(s) for denial.

permit, may authorize the conduct of the event at a date, time, location, or

accept an alternate permit shall, within 5 days after notice of the action of
the Board, file a written notice of acceptance with the Board.

§ 99.02 CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS; DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Persons designated by the Director of Planning and Development as Code
Enforcement Officers are referred to herein as Code Enforcement Officers. The
Code Enforcement Officers will be under the supervision of the Neighborhood
Development Coordinator.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the Code Enforcement Officers to
supervise regular collection of all trash, debris, waste and landfill material,
as set forth and defined in this subchapter. It shall be the direct
responsibility of the Code Enforcement Officers to enforce the provisions of
this subchapter, determine violations, and take action as set forth pursuant to
the procedures stated herein. The Code Enforcement Officers shall have the
right to observe the exterior condition of private property and to enter the
exterior of publicly accessible private property and/or obtain inspection
warrants pursuant to I.C. 36-7-9-16 when required, to make inspections, post
notices, issue written warnings, citations, orders and/or other applicable
documents and for any other purpose in the performance of his or her duties in
enforcing this subchapter.

and residential trash generated at residential dwelling structures will be
collected by the city or its designee. Industrial waste, debris, commercial
garbage and all garbage and refuse generated at locations that are not
residential dwelling structures shall be disposed of by the owner. Residential
dwelling structures will be the only structures with trash collection by the
city because nonresidential structures are exclusively commercial enterprises,
the cost of trash collection is a reasonable business expense for the
enterprises, and the city has determined that tax revenue required for trash
collections for nonresidential structures would be unreasonably high. Although
rental buildings with 4 units or less are also commercial in nature in regard
to the land owner, the cost to the city for trash collection for same is
reasonable.
   (B)   Commercial garbage and industrial waste shall be stored and collected
in accordance with the regulations of the Board of Public Works.
   (C)   Citizens at residential dwelling structures are encouraged to avail
themselves of the city recycling program. The city or its designee,
concurrently with the collection and disposal of residential garbage, trash and
refuse, also will collect recyclables at residential dwelling structures.
Recyclables include the following:
      (1)   Newspapers and inserts, office and copy paper, junk mail, telephone
books, paper bags, computer paper and other papers (but not contaminated paper,
soiled napkins, carbon paper or envelopes with plastic windows);
      (2)   Magazines and catalogs;
      (3)   Green, brown and clear glass (but not pyrex, light bulbs, plate
glass, drinking glasses, ceramics, auto glass, tempered glass or mirrors);
      (4)   Aluminum, steel, tin and bi-metal cans (but not cans that have
contained pesticides, herbicides or paint, aluminum foil, disposable aluminum

sanitary condition.
   (G)   Except as provided in division (E) of this section, garbage bags
containing accumulated garbage shall not be stored outside of a building except
in an approved container. Garbage containers shall be kept in the rear yard of
the property except when placed out for collection in accordance with this
section. Upon written application, the Neighborhood Development Coordinator may
allow special placement of containers. Containers placed outside of a building
for collection in accordance with this section shall not be considered to be

material by the Neighborhood Development Coordinator. A $25 permit fee shall be
paid by each applicant upon submission of his or her application for landfill
permit.

tenant and/or occupant for conditions on property over which the tenant and/or
occupant has control. Enforcement of the subchapter against any owner of record

preside over each hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing
Authority may affirm the order, rescind the order or modify the order, but
unless the person to whom the order was issued, or counsel for that person, is

remove weeds and rank vegetation from any real or personal property within the
city within 48 hours. Notice of the order shall be given to any owner of record

and rank vegetation exist. Notice to any owner of record may be mailed to the
last known address of such owner of record. Notice to any tenant or occupant

the weeds and rank vegetation exist.
         (b)    A person to whom an order is issued may appeal the order by
filing a written appeal with the office of the Neighborhood Development
Coordinator within 48 hours after delivery of notice of the order. If a written
appeal is filed, a hearing before the Hearing Authority appointed pursuant
hereto shall be held no sooner than 48 hours after notice of the order is
given. The Hearing Authority may affirm, rescind or modify the order.

neglect, or refusal to comply with the order of the Hearing Authority entered
pursuant to said hearing, or whenever a nuisance exists which creates a health
or safety hazard requiring immediate abatement in order to protect public
health or safety, the Neighborhood Development Coordinator may abate the
nuisance. The Neighborhood Coordinator may abate the nuisance by contract with
a contractor or with city equipment and personnel from the Street Department or
other city departments. The Neighborhood Development Coordinator will keep

§ 102.05 POLICE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of an application for a parade or public assembly permit,
the Board of Public Works shall provide a copy of the application to the Chief
of Police of the city. The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what
extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the parade or
public assembly for traffic control and public safety. The Chief of Police
shall base this decision on the size, location, duration, time and date of the
event, the expected sale or service of alcoholic beverages, the number of
streets and intersections blocked, and the need to detour or preempt citizen
travel and use of the streets and sidewalks. The speech content of the event
shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary
to the extent the Chief of Police does not reasonably foresee that same will
affect public safety or the probability of injury to persons or property. If
possible, without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of
public safety, regularly scheduled on-duty personnel will police the event. If
additional police protection for the public assembly is deemed necessary by the
Chief of Police, he or she shall so inform the President of the Board of Public
Works, who shall then inform the applicant for the permit. The applicant then
shall have the duty to secure the police protection deemed necessary by the
Chief of Police at the sole expense of the applicant.
   (B)   Persons engaging in parades or public assemblies conducted for the
sole purpose of public issue speech protected under the First Amendment are not
required to pay for any police protection provided by the city.

§ 102.06 STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE.
   (A)   The President of the Board of Public Works shall issue a permit as
provided for herein when, from a consideration of the application and from such
other information as may otherwise be obtained, he or she finds that:
      (1)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not substantially
interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other pedestrian or vehicular
traffic contiguous to its route or location;
      (2)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require the
diversion of so great a number of city police officers to properly police the
line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police
protection of the city;
      (3)   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at public
assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly interfere with
proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous
to such public assembly areas;
      (4)   There is an unacceptable risk that the conduct of the parade or
public assembly will cause injury to persons or property;
      (5)   The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point
of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable
delay en route;
      (6)   Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or
will be made available in or adjacent to any public assembly areas;
      (7)   There are sufficient parking places near the site of the parade or
public assembly to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected;
      (8)   The applicant has secured the police protection, if any, required
under this chapter;
      (9)   Such parade, or public assembly is not for the primary purpose of
advertising any product, goods, or event that is primarily for the purpose of
private profit, and the parade itself is not for private profit; (The
prohibition against advertising any product, goods or event shall not apply to
signs identifying organizations or sponsors furnishing or sponsoring exhibits
or structures used in the parade.)
      (10)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
and location is already granted or has been received and will be granted;
      (11)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
but a different location is already granted or has been received and will be
granted, and the police resources required for that prior parade or public
assembly are so great that in combination with the subsequent proposed
application, the resulting deployment of police services would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property;
      (12)   No event is scheduled elsewhere in the city where the police
resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of police
services for the proposed parade or public assembly would have an immediate and
adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property; and
      (13)   The parade or public assembly would not be in violation of valid
law.
   (B)   No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a city street, sidewalk or
right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the
structure is obtained from the Board of Public Works.

Council finds it to be in the best interests of the residents of the city and
the general public to provide for the regulation of conduct stated herein that
it deems to be offensive, to prevent vice, disorder and immorality; and to
promote public peace, health and safety, and to this end, the Council enacts
this subchapter.

(1979 Code, § 151.008) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.009 LOT AREAS, BUILDING REGULATIONS AND GENERAL PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Lot area and yards.
      (1)   When 2 parcels of land, either of which lacks adequate area or
dimension to qualify for a permitted use under the requirements of the use
district in which they are located, are contiguous and are held in 1 ownership,
they shall be considered 1 zoning lot.
      (2)   No yard or lot existing at the effective date of this chapter shall
be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth
herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this chapter shall
meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter.
      (3)   No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or

   (B)   Building on a zoning lot.
      (1)   Every structure hereafter erected or altered to provide dwelling
units shall be located on a zoning lot, and there shall not be more than 1 such
principal structure on any zoning lot in an R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-5 residential
district, except in planned unit developments.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, every structure shall
be constructed or erected upon a lot or parcel of land which abuts on a public
street. Permits for structures proposed on permanent easements of access to a
public street may be obtained, provided:
         (a)   The easement and the location of a structure on any lot facing
such easement have been approved by the Plan Commission;
         (b)   The lot shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter;
provided that, the access easement shall not be included in the zoning lot
area;
         (c)   If city sewers are not provided, the lot shall meet the
requirements of the local and state health departments.
      (3)   All residential detached principal buildings shall have a minimum
width of 24 feet and a minimum of 950 square feet of habitable space.
      (4)   The space between the floor joists of the building and grade level
shall be completely enclosed with a permanent perimeter enclosure, except for
required openings, and can be secured to it by any manner approved by the
Building Commissioner.
      (5)   The Board of Works may approve or disapprove applications for

(1979 Code, § 151.009) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.010 REGULATIONS FOR NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   Within the districts and overlay districts established by this
chapter, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which
were lawful prior to the passage of this chapter, but which are now prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter. It is the intent of
this chapter to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their continuance. The uses are declared by this
chapter to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved.
      (2)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
for which a permit was lawfully granted prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has
been started within 6 months after the date of permit and completed within 18
months.
      (3)   Any use which is permitted as a special exception or conditional
use in a district under the terms of this chapter shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use in such district, but shall be considered a conforming use.
   (B)   Types of non-conformities.
      (1)   Single nonconforming lots of record. Where, on the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lot of record exists which fails to
meet the requirements applicable in its zoning district for lot area or width,
or both, a principal structure and permitted accessory structures may be
erected on the lot only with the prior approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals;
provided that, required yard dimensions and all other requirements applicable
in the district are met. A lot which shares continuous frontage with other lots
held under the same ownership on the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter does not qualify for Board of Zoning Appeals approval under this
division.
      (2)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If 2 or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot
width and area, the lands involved shall be deemed an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this chapter. No portion of such a parcel shall be used or sold in
a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot width or area less than the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter which could not be
built under the requirements of this chapter by reason of restrictions in area,
lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk or other
requirements concerning the structure, the structure may continue so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
         (a)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof with
the exception of nonconforming signs, may be altered to decrease its
nonconformity. Any structural alteration to a nonconforming sign shall conform
to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. Structural
alterations include alterations to the foundation base pole and cabinet.
Structural alterations shall not include general maintenance or the replacement
of lettering or panels.
         (b)   Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it must thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved;
         (c)   Should a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure be
destroyed by any means, it shall not be rebuilt, restored or reconstructed, or
occupied for any use unless the structure will then conform to all regulations
of this chapter. To be destroyed means to suffer damage to the extent of more
than 50% of the replacement cost of the structure, exclusive of foundation.
         (d)   When a nonconforming structure is damaged to the extent of 50%
or less of the replacement cost of the structure, exclusive of foundation, the
structure may be rebuilt in the same location, using the same building
footprint, provided that rebuilding begins within 1 year of the event which
caused the damage. Rebuilding shall be diligently pursued to completion or the
right to restore the structure as a nonconforming structure shall be forfeited.
Restoration of a nonconforming structure pursuant to this division shall not
increase the degree of nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such
damage.
         (e)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, work
may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided that, a building permit is
obtained where necessary. Repairs shall not be permitted if the structure or
any portion thereof is declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety.
      (4)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where on the effective date of the
adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful uses of land exist which would
not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, the uses may be
continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
         (a)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
         (b)   No nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
         (c)   No existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located; (No additional structure shall be erected in connection
with a nonconforming use of land.)
         (d)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of the
structure it occupies which were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at
the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside the structure;
         (e)   When a nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use, the
nonconforming use status shall be lost and no nonconforming use shall
thereafter be resumed; and (A nonconforming use may be replaced only by a use
which complies with the provisions of this chapter.)
         (f)   If any nonconforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned
for more than 1 year, any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is
located.
      (5)   Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and land in
combination. Where, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, a lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted under the
terms of this chapter and such use occupies a lot or structure which does not
meet applicable requirements for lots or structures under this chapter,
continuation of the legal nonconforming status of the use, lot, or structure
shall be determined by the provisions applicable to each type of nonconformity.

§ 151.011 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Introduction to terms. For the purposes of this chapter, the terms
listed in division (B) shall be interpreted as they are defined in that
section. All other terms not herein defined shall have the meaning customarily
assigned to them in such context.
   (B)   Definitions.
      A ZONE. Portions of the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are
labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone
A99 on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).
The definitions are presented below:
         ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
         ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
         ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between 1 and 3 feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
         ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between 1 and 3
feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown
within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
         ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
         ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
      ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT BUILDING. A structure used to house equipment for the
operation, maintenance or repair of a wireless telecommunications tower
including electronic receiving and relay equipment.
      ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure which is
subordinate to the principal structure and is located on the same zoning lot.
The use of the accessory structure is incidental and accessory to that of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential.
      ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION. On-site erection, fabrication, installation,
alteration, demolition, or removal of any structure, facility, or addition
thereto, including all related activities, but not restricted to, clearing of
land, earth moving, and landscaping.
      ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which
is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
      ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
         (a)   ADULT BOOKSTORE. An establishment having as a significant
portion of its stock in trade books, films, magazines and other periodicals
which are distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting or
describing “sex act(s)” or “specified anatomical areas.”
         (b)   ADULT MOTEL. A motel wherein material is presented which is
distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on depicting or describing “sex
act(s)” or “specified anatomical areas.”
         (c)   ADULT MOTION PICTURE ARCADE. Any place to which the public is
permitted or invited wherein coin or token-operated or electronically,
electrically or mechanically controlled still or motion picture machines,
projectors or other image-producing devices are maintained to show images to 5
or fewer persons per machine at any 1 time, and where images so displayed are
distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting or describing
“sex act(s)” or “specified anatomical areas.”
         (d)   ADULT MOTION PICTURE THEATER. An enclosed building used for
presenting material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter
depicting or describing “sex act(s)” or “specified anatomical areas” for
observation by patrons therein.
         (e)   ADULT LOUNGE or NIGHT CLUB. Any establishment that features
topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female
impersonators or similar entertainers.
         (f)   For purposes of the above, the terms SEX ACT(S) and SPECIFIED
ANATOMICAL AREAS shall mean the following:
            1.   SEX ACT(S). Means and includes the following:
               a.   Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal;
               b.   Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy;
and
               c.   Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic
region, buttock or female breast.
            2.   SPECIFIED ANATOMICAL AREAS. Means and includes the following:
               a.   Less than completely and opaquely covered human genitals,
pubic region, buttock and female breast below a point immediately above the top
of the areola; and
               b.   Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if
completely and opaquely covered.
      AIRPORT. The Elkhart Municipal Airport.

§ 151.049 R-5, URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The R-5 District is designed to control development and
redevelopment in existing older residential neighborhoods originally created
primarily for single-family residences. Over the years many of these
neighborhoods have experienced an increase in the intensity of use due to the
conversion of older single-family residences to 2 or more residential unit
structures. The goal of this district is to ensure this development does not
create a detriment to the neighborhood due to inadequate parking and
infrastructure, undersized lots and general incompatibility with the
surrounding neighborhood. Limitations on permitted uses and specific criteria
for increasing use intensities are incorporated to protect the integrity and
viability of these older established neighborhoods.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)    One-family dwellings located on a permanent foundation with a
minimum width of 24 feet and a minimum of 950 square feet of habitable space.

drives and parking areas; and
         (d)   Use of all structures within 200 feet of the petitioned
property.
      (3)   Board of Zoning Appeals review. In order to grant approval of a
conditional use in the R-5 District, the Board of Zoning Appeals must find that
the following standards, together with the standards applicable to conditional
uses specified in §
151.287, have been met:
         (a)   The proposed conditional use is consistent with existing
neighborhood density;
         (b)   The proposed conditional use is compatible with existing
neighborhood uses and character;
         (c)   The proposed development (including all structures, drives and
parking areas) will not occupy more than 60% of the total lot area;
         (d)   Sufficient capacity exists both within the public infrastructure

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 151.120 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Elkhart does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the City of Elkhart are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

FLOOD HAZARD AREA.)
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).

regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land

cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE or FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose

facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this subchapter, the exceptional
HARDSHIP that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL– EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES REPORTS provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified, installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the 6-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this 6-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of  revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:

proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out-as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.

or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters;
and
         (b)   At least 2 openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
1 square inch for every 1 square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.

which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a

structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are

the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this subchapter.
   WALLED AND ROOFED. A building that has 2 or more exterior rigid walls and a
fully secured roof and is affixed to a permanent site.

§ 151.122 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this subchapter applies. This subchapter shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the City
of Elkhart, Indiana as identified in division (B) below, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Elkhart,
Indiana.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Elkhart, delineated as an
"AE Zone" on the Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated August 2, 2011 shall be determined from the 1% annual chance flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas
and the corresponding flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) dated August 2, 2011, as
well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. Should the
floodway limits not be delineated on the flood insurance rate map for a studied
SFHA designated as an "AE Zone", the limits of the floodway will be according
to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Elkhart, delineated as
an "A Zone" on the Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate
Map, dated August 2, 2011, as well as any subsequent updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best available flood layer provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than 1 square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available flood layer data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than 1 square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance.
      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this subchapter and other applicable regulations.
      (2)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this subchapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the
development.
      (3)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable
regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This subchapter is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this subchapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine Zone A or
AE) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the
profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is at or
above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
subchapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability on the part of the
City of Elkhart, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this subchapter, or
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this subchapter. All violations shall be considered a common
nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning
Code for the City of Elkhart. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not
exceeding $2,500.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The City of Elkhart shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

permits may be required. If specific federal, state and/or local permits are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the floodplain development permit;
      (6)   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations;
      (7)   For applications to improve structures, including alterations,
movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
         (a)   Verify and document the market value of the pre-damaged or pre-
improved structure;
         (b)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement; or the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition; or the combined costs
of improvements and repair, if applicable, to the market value of the pre-
damaged or pre-improved structure. The cost of all work must be included in the
project costs, including work that might otherwise be considered routine
maintenance. Items/activities that must be included in the cost shall be in
keeping with guidance published by FEMA to ensure compliance with the NFIP and
to avoid any conflict with future flood insurance claims of policyholders
within the community;
         (c)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as

and "as-built" elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed
subject to this subchapter in accordance with division (D) below;
      (20)   Coordinate map maintenance activities and associated FEMA follow-
up in accordance with division (E) below;
      (21)   Utilize and enforce all letters of map change (LOMC) or physical
map revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
community; and
      (22)   Request any additional information which may be necessary to
determine the disposition of a proposed development or structure with respect
to the requirements of this subchapter.
   (D)   Administrative procedures.
      (1)   Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit
progresses, the Floodplain Administrator shall make as many inspections of the
work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the
provisions of the local ordinance and terms of the permit. In exercising this
power, the Administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credential,
to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable
hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      (2)   Stop work orders.
         (a)   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this subchapter shall immediately cease.
         (b)   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner

         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this subchapter.
      (4)   Floodplain management records.
         (a)   Regardless of any limitation on the period required for
retention of public records, records of actions associated with the
administration of this subchapter shall be kept on file and maintained under
the direction of the Floodplain Administrator in perpetuity. These records
include permit applications; plans; certifications; flood insurance rate maps;
letter of map change; records of issuance of permits and denial of permits;
determinations of whether proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or
repair of substantial damage; required design certifications and documentation
of elevations required by this subchapter; notifications to adjacent
communities, FEMA, and the state related to alterations of watercourses;
assurances that the flood carrying capacity of altered watercourses will be
maintained; documentation related to appeals and variances, including
justification for issuance or denial; and records of enforcement actions taken
pursuant to this subchapter.
         (b)   These records shall be available for public inspection at
Elkhart City Hall, 229 South 2nd Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46516.
      (5)   Periodic inspection. Once a project is completed, periodic
inspections may be conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure
compliance. The Floodplain Administrator shall have a right, upon presentation
of proper credential, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the Department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action.
   (E)   Map maintenance activities. To meet NFIP minimum requirements to have
flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the City of
Elkhart flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
151.122(B) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within 6 months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area; and
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA form (MT-2) or submitted through the online letter of map
change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
         (d)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Elkhart
and may be submitted to FEMA at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Elkhart have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately
represents the City of Elkhart boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the City of Elkhart suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Elkhart has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (F)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board), as established by Common
Council of Elkhart, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error
in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this subchapter. Any
person aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision to the
Elkhart County Circuit or Superior Court.
      (3)   In considering such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this subchapter, and:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (g)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (h)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (i)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of use, and
sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
         (j)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (5)   Variances from the provisions of this subchapter shall only be
granted when the Board can make positive findings of fact based on evidence
submitted at the hearing for the following:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the vanance would result m
exceptional hardship as defined in §
151.121; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (6)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.124(A)(1), §
151.124(A)(3)(a) or §
151.124(A)(4) may be granted.
      (7)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
151.124(A)(1), §
151.124(A)(3)(a) or §
151.124(A)(4) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
      (8)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
151.124 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of ½
acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (9)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation
of"historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
      (10)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
      (11)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (12)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this subchapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this subchapter.
      (13)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (14)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 5995, passed 7-1-2024)
§ 151.124 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   Floodplain status standards.
      (1)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs established in §
151.122(B) are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1), a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
         (a)   If the site is in a regulatory flood way as established in §
151.122(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction
in a floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this section.
         (c)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
         (d)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and
meeting requirements of §
151.123(E)(1). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
         (e)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as
an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot
as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
         (f)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping
standard regulations found at 44 CFR 65.12.
      (2)   Fringe (riverine). If the site is in the fringe (either identified
on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
through detailed or approximate studies and not identified on a FIRM), the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit
provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (3)   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/
fringes (riverine).
         (a)   1.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one
square mile. If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than 1square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
         (b)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than 1 square mile.
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than 1 square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
            2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (4)   SFHAs not identified on a map.
         (a)   If a proposed development site is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than 1 square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (approval for
construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or evidence of general
license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing
the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade
has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
written approval, evidence of general license qualification, or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, a floodplain development permit may be
issued, provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
   (B)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction, reconstruction or repairs made to a
repetitive loss structure, and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements must incorporate
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (4)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above the FPG for
residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at/above
the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and sewer

Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., as amended) and with state regulations
that may affect wetlands.
   (B)   Definitions. Words or terms used in this section should be interpreted
by their common-sense meanings unless more specifically defined otherwise. The
definitions and rules of construction that apply to the other parts of the
zoning ordinance shall apply to this section unless a different definition or
rule is provided for in this division.
      ADVERSE IMPACT. Anything that would destroy, harm, impair, diminish or
degrade the value or utility of a wetland for pollution control, flood
preservation, ground water recharge or habitat for fish and wildlife.
      FILL MATERIAL. Any solid material that displaces water or reduces water
holding capacity.
      HYDROPHYTIC VEGETATION. Plant life growing in water or on a substrate
that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive
water content. Plant species of this type are listed in: P.B. Reed, Jr.,

this subchapter, provided the applicant establishes that:
      (1)    The grant of the proposed variance complies with I.C. 36-7-4-918.4
as amended and §
151.287(A) and (B) of the Zoning Ordinance; and that
      (2)   The grant of the proposed variance will not adversely affect the
water quality, volume of ground water supply or flood storage capacity of the
Wetland District.
   (B)   Variances shall give the minimum relief necessary to alleviate the
applicant’s hardship.
   (C)   No variances shall permit storm water runoff from a street, parking
area or roof of an industrial or commercial building to be directed into a

receipt by the Planning and Zoning Staff of all required federal and state
permits.
   (E)   No variance or special exception shall allow construction or dredging
to disturb waterfowl breeding areas during breeding season or fish spawning
areas during spawning season.
   (F)   Whenever a variance or special exception is granted for a use that may
alter the grade or contour of land in a Wetland District, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall require that, upon completion of the proposed construction, the
applicant will restore the land as closely as possible to its original grade
and contour.
   (G)   No variance or special exception shall allow a net loss of wetland
area. Where all or part of a wetland in a Wetland District would be destroyed
or substantially altered by a proposed development, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall require mitigation by the applicant and his or her successors in interest
according to the following standards:
      (1)   Acre-for-acre replacement of the same or a better type of wetland
providing the environmental benefits that would be lost because of the proposed
development.
      (2)   Replacement wetlands shall be located reasonably close to the
Wetland District, as determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals, in which the
losses are sustained and shall become part of the District, if practical.
      (3)   Periodic maintenance for replacement wetlands shall be carried out
by the applicant for a minimum of 3 years to control erosion, remove nuisance
vegetation and assure the establishment and survival of predominantly

bond or other performance guarantee sufficient to assure the city the
satisfactory completion of replacement wetlands.
      (5)   If replacement of the same or better type of wetland is not
possible adjacent to the Wetland District in which the projected losses would
be sustained, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider replacement at ratios
greater than one to one of a lesser quality wetland adjacent to the Wetland
District.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may require replacement of wetland
losses of less than 1/3 of an acre even when the applicant has received federal
or state approval for the proposed construction without mitigative conditions.
      (7)   The authorization of replacement wetlands shall not be used as a
means of permitting avoidable losses of natural wetlands.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 151.160 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city recognizes that development, especially within certain
districts or geographic areas, can have major impacts on the visual and
physical character of the city. Consequently, it has established the
requirement of “development plan” submittal and approval within critical
specified zoning districts. These include: CBD, Central Business District; B-4,
Regional Business District; OP, Office Park District; and BP, Business Park
District. Within these districts, a high level of site and building plan review
is required.
   (B)   The city further recognizes that the need for this increased level of
review may not always occur within the fixed boundaries of a specific zoning
district. Instead, areas of major developmental impact may occupy only a
portion of a zoning district or include all or portions of several districts.
These could include:
      (1)   Corridors along major traffic arteries, including gateways into the
city; or
      (2)   A specific geographic area which due to its location, land uses,
physical character or other factors significantly affects on the overall
character of the city.
   (C)   It is the intent of this section to permit the establishment of
Development Plan Overlay Districts to supplement those specified zoning
districts requiring the submittal and approval of a “development plan.” The
purpose of these overlay districts is to:
      (1)   Encourage orderly and compatible development;
      (2)   Encourage a high standard of visual quality within the district;
      (3)   Protect existing and future property values;
      (4)   Promote the safe flow of traffic on streets within the district and
the integration of various transportation options including pedestrian, bicycle
and vehicular networks; and
      (5)   Protect and preserve the quality and integrity of residential
neighborhoods within and adjacent to the districts.
(1979 Code, § 151.130) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.161 DEFINITION.
   The Development Plan Overlay District is a floating zone that may overlay a
portion of an underlying zoning district or all or portions of several zoning
districts. All properties located in the district undergoing modification or
new construction shall be required to submit a development plan to the city’s
Plan Commission for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance. Additional design and development standards, including
site and building, may be incorporated into the district at the time of its
establishment, supplementing or superseding those of the underlying zoning
district and the general development standards of the Zoning Ordinance. The
establishment of the Development Plan Overlay District does not affect the uses
permitted by right, special exception or conditional use of the underlying
zoning.
(1979 Code, § 151.131) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.162 BASIC REQUIREMENTS.
   A Development Plan Overlay District boundary shall encompass those
properties that share a common identity due to geographic location, historic or
locational significance, design characteristics (site and/or building), use,
significant transportation routes or physical features, or other identified
unifying characteristics. Boundaries will be determined at the time a district
is created.
(1979 Code, § 151.132) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)

a District may be initiated by the Plan Commission or by a petition signed by
the property owners of not less than 75% of the land to be included in the
district.
      (2)   Since the district does not dictate land use, but only requires
adherence to the development plan review process and associated design and
developmental standards as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, notification
shall be required only to those property owners within the proposed district.
The notification shall be by legal notice in the local newspaper and direct
mailing to the affected property owners.
   (B)   Preliminary review.
      (1)   Preliminary review of a proposed district is required for those
applications initiated by petition of property owners. Prior to filing a formal
application for a district, the petitioner(s) shall submit to the Planning and
Zoning office no less than 6 copies of the proposal including the following
information:
         (a)   A map indicating the boundaries of the proposed district;
         (b)   A narrative explaining the reason or need for creating the
district;
         (c)   Whether Type I and/or Type II Design Standards will apply; and
         (d)   Additional development standards, if any, being recommended and
explanation as to why they are necessary.
      (2)   The Planning staff may request additional information deemed
necessary for consideration of the proposed district.
      (3)   The Planning staff shall review the proposal for compliance with
the city’s Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. General
discussions may be conducted between staff and the petitioner(s) to clarify the
proposal or incorporate necessary modifications prior to filing of the formal
petition.
   (C)   Plan Commission action. The Plan Commission shall conduct a public
hearing on a proposed Development Plan Overlay District and forward its
recommendation consisting of any conditions or modifications and the district
boundary map to the City Council for final action.
   (D)   City Council action.  The City Council shall make the final
determination on the proposed district. Action by the Council shall be in
accordance with §

DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCEDURES AND DESIGN CRITERIA
§ 151.175 PURPOSE.
   Development within certain districts or geographic areas may have a major
impact on the visual, physical and functional character of that portion of the
city, or of the city as a whole. Appropriate development in these areas must
serve to protect the public health, safety and welfare; preserve the natural
environment; encourage efficient use of resources; promote the visual quality
of the city; and minimize the burdens of new development on city services.
Consequently, within those specified zoning and overlay districts the
submission of development plans will be required for review and approval prior
to the issuance of any permits. The purpose of this section is to establish
procedures and requirements for the review, approval and amendment of
development plans.

§ 151.182 DEVELOPMENT PLAN DESIGN STANDARDS - TYPE I.
   The following minimum design standards shall apply to all improvements
within any development plan district, except as indicated, and shall be
considered in the review process by the planning staff or Plan Commission. The
requirements of the underlying zoning district shall also be criteria for
review. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this section and
other regulations in this chapter, the more restrictive standard shall apply,
unless otherwise determined by the planning staff.
   (A)   District character. The proposed development shall be compatible with
the design character of adjacent development in regard to scale and mass and
shall promote the development goals and purpose of the zoning or overlay
district in which it is located.
   (B)   Environmental design.
      (1)   It is the intention of the city to encourage the preservation of
natural site amenities and to minimize the disturbance to the natural
environment.
      (2)   Existing trees and other natural amenities shall be preserved
wherever possible. The location of these features must be considered when
planning common open space, building location, underground services, walks,
paved areas and finished grade levels. Inquiries may be made into the means by
which natural features will be protected during construction.
      (3)   The proposed development shall have a logical relationship to the
topography of the site and adjacent property.
      (4)   Landscaping in the Riverwalk Overlay District shall be designed to
soften the placement of buildings within the district and screen parking areas
to create an overall streetscape along the Riverwalk. Landscaping standards
shall be as follows:
         (a)   Parking areas and access drives located within 20 feet of the
Riverwalk shall be screened so that vehicles are not visible from the
Riverwalk. Landscape screening shall include one or more of the following
treatments:
            1.   A 5-foot high opaque wall or fence in conjunction with
shrubbery and/or trees. Fence and/or wall materials shall be compatible with
facade materials used on the primary building.
            2.   Coniferous trees or hedges that are at least 5 feet in height.
            3.   An earthen berm that is at least 5 feet high in height. The
earthen berm shall have vegetative ground cover.
         (b)   Yard areas that are adjacent to the Riverwalk shall have
vegetative ground cover and include 2 or more of the following treatments:
            1.   Canopy trees;
            2.   Decorative trees;
            3.   Decorative bushes; and
            4.   Decorative fencing;.
   (C)   Site development.
      (1)   Structures shall be located to allow adequate light, air, and ease
of entry and access by the general public and emergency personnel. The
development shall conform to all applicable development standards and district
regulations specified in this chapter.
      (2)   Riverwalk Overlay District structures shall be located to create an
inviting, pedestrian-scaled "streetscape" along the Riverwalk (as amended per
Ordinance No. 4533, dated November 8, 2000). For parcels within the Riverwalk
Overlay that front Main Street, Jackson Boulevard, or Elkhart Avenue, the site
should be designed to primarily address these streets. Consideration should
still be given to creating an inviting atmosphere along the Riverwalk but these
parcels must support an established street wall along these important
corridors.
   (D)   Vehicular circulation systems - general. The following standards apply
to all properties located within a development plan district:
      (1)   The number, location and dimensions of accel-decel lanes, passing
blisters and entry drives, shall be evaluated on the basis of city’s Public

   (E)   Vehicular circulation systems - arterial streets. The following
standards apply only to properties located on an arterial street within a
development plan district:
      (1)   In order to reduce traffic hazards and maintain the traffic
carrying capacity of the arterial streets, required access control elements may
include:
         (a)   Cross-access agreements. The property owner enters into an
easement agreement with adjacent property owner(s) and/or the city to provide
cross property access allowing multiple developments to share a common entry
from the arterial street. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the
reviewing authority and shall be recorded.
         (b)   Frontage roads. The property owner grants the city an easement
for the construction of a parallel frontage road to connect individual
developments to a common entry from the arterial street.
         (c)   Temporary access drives. Where parcels adjacent to the subject
property are undeveloped, a development plan may be approved with direct access
to and from the arterial street provided that the property owner delivers to
the city a commitment that if at any time access becomes available through a
cross access easement or frontage road connected to a common entry, the
property owner will close the direct access drive.
      (2)   The reviewing authority may require delivery of such other
commitments as it may deem necessary to control site access.
   (F)   Vehicular circulation systems. Riverwalk Overlay District parking lots
shall be designed to minimize vehicular traffic along the Riverwalk. Primary
structures shall be located between the Riverwalk and access drives and parking
lots. Service and access drives shall not be located adjacent to the Riverwalk.
   (G)   Pedestrian circulation systems. Walkways and plazas shall be
constructed to provide pedestrian circulation throughout the development
separate from all vehicular drives and parking areas. Where distance separation
cannot be achieved, physical separation by means approved by the reviewing
authority shall be required. Pavement treatment and materials should be such
that they clearly differentiate pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas.
Developments located in the Riverwalk Overlay District shall provide pedestrian
access between the development and the Riverwalk. Materials used to construct
the pedestrian circulation systems shall be complimentary to those used in the
Riverwalk.
   (H)   Sanitary sewage disposal and water supply systems. All water supply
and sanitary sewage disposal systems shall comply with the requirements of the
city’s and state’s Board of Health, as applicable.
   (I)   Public or semi-public space. All developments including public or
semi-public space must contain acceptable covenants insuring adequate

Zone is established at each end of the precision instrument runways of the
airport for precision instrument landings and take-offs. The precision
instrument approach zones shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200
feet beyond each end of the runways, widening thereafter uniformly to a width
of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runways, its
centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runways.
   (B)   Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Nonprecision Instrument
Approach Zones are established at each end of the nonprecision runways of the
airport for nonprecision landings and take-offs. The nonprecision instrument
approach zones shall have a width of 500 feet beginning at a distance of 200
feet beyond each end of the runways, widening thereafter uniformly to a width
of 2,000 feet and 3,500 feet, respectively, at a distance of 5,200 feet and
10,200 feet, respectively, beyond each end of the runways, its centerline being
the continuation of the centerline of the runways.
   (C)   Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established adjacent to
each runway and approach zone. Transition zones extend outward and upward, at
right angles to the runway centerline and runway centerline extended and at a
slope of 7 feet horizontally for each 1 foot vertically from the side of the
primary zones and from the sides of the approach zones to a point where they
intersect the horizontal zone. Transitional zones for those portions of the
precision approach zone which project through and beyond the limits of the
conical zone extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the
edge of the approach zone and right angles to the runway centerline.
   (D)   Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area
which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from each end of the
precision instrument primary zone and the east end of the east-west
nonprecision primary zone and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to
those arcs.
   (E)   Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the instrument
approach zones and transition zones.
   (F)   Primary zone. The primary zone is a surface longitudinally centered on
a runway extending 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the
primary surface is 500 feet for nonprecision runways and 1,000 feet for

§ 151.212 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in the section, no structure or tree
shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created
by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit herein established
for the zone. The height limitations are hereby established for each of the
zones in question as follows:
      (1)   Precision instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50
feet horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the
elevation of the end of the precision instrument runway and extending to a
distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway, thence 1 foot in height for
each 40 feet horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the
runway;
      (2)   Nonprecision instrument approach zones. For the east-west
nonprecision zone - 1 foot in height for each 34 feet horizontal distance
beginning at the ends of the primary zone and extending for a distance of
10,000 feet. For the north-south nonprecision zone - 1 foot in height for each
20 feet horizontal beginning at the ends of the primary zone and extending for
a distance of 5,000 feet;
      (3)   Transition zones. One foot in height for each 7 feet horizontal
distance beginning at any point on the sides of the primary zone and approach
zones, extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is
777 feet above mean sea level. Further, where the precision instrument approach
zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of 1 foot for
each 7 feet horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the edge of
the instrument approach zone measured normal to the centerline of the runway
extended;
      (4)   Horizontal zone. One hundred and fifty feet above the airport
elevation or a height of 927 feet above mean sea level; and
      (5)   Conical zone. One foot in height for each 20 feet horizontal
distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a
height of 350 feet above the airport elevation;
      (6)   Primary zone. The elevation of any point on the primary zone is the
same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
   (B)   Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more
restrictive limitation shall prevail. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or
structure to a height consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 151.215 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses.
      (1)   Except as specifically provided in this section, no material change
shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected,
altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a
zoning clearance permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for a zoning clearance permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed.
         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet in height, except when, because of terrain, land contour or
topographic features, the tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for the zone.
         (b)   In the areas lying within the limits of the instrument and non-
instrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200
feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet in height, except when the tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for the instrument or non-instrument
approach zone.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree of structure less than 75 feet in height, except when such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land-contour or topographic features, would
extend above the height limit prescribed for transition zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter, as set forth in §
151.212.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air
navigation, than it was on the effective date of this chapter or than it is
when the application for a permit is made.
   (C)   Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if
the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and be
reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question to permit the Board of Aviation
Commissioners, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon the
markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an
airport hazard.
   (D)   Increase.  Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the
height of any structure or permit the growth of any plant life or use his
property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section may
apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance in accordance with the
procedure set forth in §
151.287, plus the mandatory referral of the applications to the Board of
Aviation Commissioners for their recommendation.

§ 151.231 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Intent. To maintain the public health, safety and welfare, it is
necessary to establish standards regulating off street parking and loading,
pedestrian movement, screening, landscaping and lighting for the enhancement of
the community. The regulations of this section are designed to alleviate
congestion of the public streets by establishing minimum requirements for the
off-street parking and loading/unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with
uses permitted under this chapter.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Scope of regulations. Off-street parking and loading provisions of
this section shall apply as follows:
         (a)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations herein.
         (b)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure is changed
to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for
such new use.
         (c)   Accessory off-street parking facilities required herein shall
not be used for the storage, display, sale, repair, dismantling or wrecking of
any vehicles, equipment or material. Parking of commercial vehicles as defined
in this ordinance is prohibited in residential zones.
         (d)   Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces shall be
provided on the same zoning lot as the use served except as otherwise provided
in this chapter. Adequate area shall be provided to permit any maneuvering
necessary to reach off-street parking and loading areas.
         (e)   Within the Central Business District (CBD), regulations
pertaining to off-street parking shall not apply to commercial buildings in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter. No off-street parking is
required for nonresidential uses in the CBD unless such uses exceed 3,000
square feet of gross floor area, in which case off-street parking must be
provided for the floor area in excess of 3,000 square feet. Up to 25% of the
number of public parking spaces within 400 feet of a proposed building in the
CBD may be counted toward the required number of spaces. These regulations are
intended to provide flexibility in site development while ensuring adequate
parking for the Main Street and Jackson Boulevard corridors as a whole (as
amended per Ordinance No. 4542 dated December 4, 2000; as amended per Ordinance
No. 4985 on September 22, 2006).
      (2)   Plan review.
         (a)   Any off-street parking lots, parking structures or loading areas
required under this chapter shall be required to submit a plan to the Planning
and Zoning Office for review and approval of applicable regulations. The plan
shall show the following:
            1.   Total number of parking spaces provided, existing and
proposed; and total required by ordinance;
            2.   Parking aisles;
            3.   Vehicle circulation;
            4.   Entrances and exits;
            5.   Sidewalks and pedestrian circulation;
            6.   Signage;
            7.   Lighting;
            8.   Storm water retention areas;
            9.   Landscaping islands; and
            10.   Landscape and buffer areas.
         (b)   All elements shall be dimensioned on the plan and distances from
property lines and structures shall be noted.
   (C)   Regulations and requirements.
      (1)   All open off-street parking areas for 4 or more vehicles shall be
screened by a solid fence, wall, densely planted evergreen screen, earthen
berm, or a combination thereof to the following height:
         (a)   A minimum of 4 feet if abutting or directly across an alley from
either a residential district or a residential use if the development
containing the parking area requires a development plan; or
         (b)   Two and one-half feet if across the street from either a
residential district or a residential use if the development containing the
parking area requires a development plan.
      (2)   Number of off-street parking spaces.
         (a)   Except as otherwise noted in this section, the number of off-
street parking spaces for each new principal use shall be provided in
accordance with division (D).
         (b)   The parking lot requirements for a use not specifically listed
in the chart shall be the same as for a listed use of similar characteristics
of parking demand generation as determined by the Planning and Zoning Office.
         (c)   For the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements,
gross floor area shall be calculated as the sum of the gross horizontal area of
the several floors of a building or buildings, including if habitable the
horizontal areas of the basement. Basement space used solely for storage or
utility shall be exempt.
         (d)   When computing the number of parking spaces, any number fraction
or portion thereof, shall be rounded up to the next highest number.
         (e)   A maximum of 130% of the required number of parking spaces per
division (D), may be provided (rounded down to the nearest whole number). Each
10% increase in the number of parking spaces shall require an additional one
percent in the interior parking lot landscaping provisions provided in this
section of the Zoning Ordinance. Provision of more than 130% of the requirement
will require a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (f)   In determining the number of parking spaces required for a
business, industry or institution or any other concern which encompasses a
number of different, yet related activities, the planning staff may determine
the total number of parking spaces required by adding the amount of spaces
required for each specific activity as listed in division (D).
         (g)   In off-street parking areas with greater than 25 automobile
parking spaces, bicycle parking spaces may be substituted for automobile
parking spaces at the rate of 10 bicycle spaces per 1 off-street parking space,
up to 4% of the total number of required automobile parking spaces with a
maximum of 10 automobile spaces replaced with bicycle parking.
      (3)   Location of parking facilities.
         (a)   The off-street parking areas required for residential buildings
or uses shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served. The
parking requirements for 1- and 2-family residential uses shall be accommodated
in paved (concrete, asphalt, concrete and brick pavers and other approved
materials) driveways which may be located in the front, side or rear yard but
may not occupy more than 50% of any yard. Off-street parking areas located in

      (4)   Joint parking facilities.
         (a)   Joint use of up to 50% of required parking areas may be
permitted for 2 or more uses located on the same or adjacent parcels provided
that the developer or owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning
staff that the uses will not overlap in hours of operation or in demand for
shared spaces. The owners of all parcels used for or making use of shared
parking areas shall execute and a record a commitment stating that the uses
will not overlap in hours of operation or in demand for shared spaces. The
commitment shall be binding on future owners of the property(s) and shall be
enforceable by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (b)   Shared parking areas shall be located not more than 300 feet
from the uses they are intended to serve and shall be connected to that use by
a defined pedestrian walkway.
         (c)   Any subsequent change in land uses among the shared parking
users shall require adequate parking as defined in division (D).
      (5)   Reduction of spaces/land banking.
         (a)   For development in any zoning district, the planning and zoning
staff may approve a total reduction of not more than 30% of the required off-
street parking spaces where it has been demonstrated by study of the proposed
use(s) and the customary operation of the use(s) that adequate parking would be
provided.
         (b)   When such a reduction is approved, an area of sufficient size to
include the number of parking spaces necessary to meet the minimum requirements
stated herein shall be designated on the site plan and no structure or paved
surface shall be permitted within such designated area. The area shall not be
included in any required buffer yards. The areas shall be reserved to
accommodate additional parking so as to meet the otherwise applicable minimum
requirements. In the event additional parking is required, a site plan shall be
submitted to the staff for approval. The additional parking shall be
constructed within 4 months thereafter.
      (6)   Access. Driveway entrances and exits to parking lots shall be
located as far away from street intersections as possible to prevent impeding
the flow of traffic in the parking lot and prevent hazards in the street.
Entrances shall be designed to allow vehicles entering the site to be stacked
to prevent backup on the adjacent street. Parking lot entrances and exits shall
be consolidated when possible to limit the number of access points to the site.

            6.   To minimize visual clutter, parking lot lighting should be
incorporated into planting areas where possible.
         (l)   Parking lot landscaping.
            1.   Parking lot landscape requirements shall be applicable to all
parking areas in all districts, and a parking lot landscape plan shall be
provided.
            2.   A landscape strip shall be provided around the perimeter of
the parking lot, as defined below:
               a.   When the parking lot abuts a building(s) the strip shall
be:
                  i.    Four feet wide - parking lot with one to 40 spaces or a
single parallel driving aisle, or any other configuration of equal or greater
square footage.
                  ii.    Six feet wide - parking lot with 41 or more spaces, or
any other configuration of equal or greater square footage.
                  iii.    For single use buildings with front facades less than
100 feet in length a minimum 150 square feet of landscape area may be installed
at the building entrance (total square footage for both sides of entrance) in
place of the required planting strip along the front facade.
                  iv.    For buildings with an arcade across the front facade
or an access aisle immediately adjacent and parallel to the front facade, the
required landscaping may be consolidated at focal points along the front facade
and/or incorporated into other required parking lot landscape areas (perimeter
or interior).
                  v.    A landscape strip abutting a building shall have at
least 50% of its length occupied by shrubs.
               b.   When the parking lot abuts a right-of-way, the strip will

follows:
1-75 spaces:         6 feet
76-150 spaces:         8 feet
151+spaces:         12 feet
               d.   When the parking lot abuts an existing parking lot which
provides for a perimeter landscape strip, the width of the strip will be equal
to the additional width needed to create a strip with an overall minimum width
as prescribed in division c. above. However, a landscape strip of at least four
feet wide must extend from the property line inward.
               e.   When a parking lot abuts a residentially zoned or used
property, a landscape area shall be provided as prescribed in the individual
zoning district and shall have a screen as prescribed in division (C)(1) of
this section.
               f.   When a new development is constructed either adjacent to or

               d.   Unless otherwise approved, plantings within islands and
peninsulas shall consist of at least one tree and mulch or groundcover for each
162 square feet, or portion thereof, of required landscape area. Shrubs may
also be used as long as they do not exceed three feet in height.
            iv.   In cases in which trees exist on the property where the
parking lot is proposed, the existing trees shall be maintained where they do
not impede construction on the site and shall count toward the interior
landscape requirement. Accepted best management practices for tree preservation
shall be used. The location of existing trees to be saved shall be included in
the landscape plan submitted to the Planning and Zoning Staff prior to site
clearance.
            v.   Parking lots for 300 or more spaces requiring a central access
drive shall have a minimum six foot wide landscape area on both sides and
running the length of the drive. A minimum of one shade tree for every 50

            ii.   Landscaping installed in parking areas shall be spaced and
maintained so that a visual obstruction that represents a traffic hazard is not
created.
         (o)   Pedestrian access.
            i.   For business and office use developments with parking lots
abutting a public right-of-way there shall be a designated route(s) for
pedestrians between the public sidewalk and the main entrance of the building
or to the sidewalk fronting the building in the case of a multi-entrance
building as per the following:
               a.   For properties with 100 feet or less of frontage abutting a
public right-of-way there shall be a minimum of one designated route.
               b.   For properties with more than 100 feet of frontage abutting
a public right-of-way a minimum of one designated route per vehicular access or
300 feet of frontage, whichever is greater.
               c.   For properties with frontage abutting two or more public
streets, the minimum required designated routes shall be provided along each
street.
            ii.   When a public sidewalk does not exist, the following shall
apply:
               a.   For new construction on vacant land, both a public sidewalk
as per city standards and the required designated pedestrian connections shall
be installed. The sidewalk must be constructed with a minimum five foot
landscaped green space (tree lawn) between the curb and the outside edge of the
sidewalk. Street trees must be planted at intervals of not less than 40 feet
apart (as amended by Ordinance 5044 on July 11,2007).
               b.   For reconstruction on an existing development, a public
sidewalk shall be installed if at least 40% of the properties on both sides of
the street in the same block have public sidewalks, as well as the required
designated pedestrian routes.
            iii.   Walkways shall be designed to be recognizable to both
drivers and pedestrians. Any combination of at least two of the following
walkway treatments shall be used:
               a.    Constructing the walk/ crosswalk from different materials,
such as concrete or brick or other material approved or recognized under The
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.
               b.    Placing bollards at sufficient regular intervals to
delineate the walk/ crosswalk.
               c.    Aligning planting islands to define the walk/crosswalk.
               d.    Raising the walk/ crosswalk.
               e.    Painting pavement with walk/crosswalk striping.
         (p)   Drive-thru facilities.
            i.   Drive-thru lanes shall be of sufficient width so as to allow
for the passage of two cars side-by-side in two marked driving lanes. In no
case shall the required width be less than 16 feet. This requirement shall
apply to the entire length of the queuing line of the drive-thru business. This
requirement also applies to the area of the parking lot necessary for the
overflow of waiting cars in the extended queuing line for drive-thru
businesses. (As amended per Ordinance No. 4683 July 10, 2002.)
            ii.   Uses which offer drive-thru operations shall have a minimum
first floor area of 800 square feet.
            iii.   Internal circulation and access to and egress from the site

            iv.   Each facility shall provide sufficient queue area of a
minimum of 20 feet per vehicle in advance of the service window to accommodate
a minimum of three vehicles per establishment. The queue area may not interfere
with other on-site circulation and parking facilities.
            v.   Pedestrian walkways must have clear visibility and be
emphasized by enhanced paving or markings when they intersect the drive-thru
aisles.
            vi.   The drive-thru use shall be screened from adjacent rights-of-
way and properties through placement of the drive-thru, screening, landscaping
or other site design techniques.
            vii.   Any curb cuts serving the use are not located within 200
feet of any intersection of the rights-of-way of the major streets or major
arterials.
            viii.   The location, size, design and operating characteristics of
the proposed facility are such that the drive-thru operation will be reasonably
compatible with and have minimal negative impact on the use of nearby
properties.

§ 151.284 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy
of any structure or land or both or part thereof for any of the following until
a certificate of occupancy has been signed by the Planning and Zoning Office
stating that the proposed use complies with the requirements of this chapter:
      (1)   Occupancy or use of any structure hereafter erected, changed
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged;
      (2)   Occupancy or use of vacant land;
      (3)   Change in the use of an existing structure;
      (4)   Change in the use of land;
      (5)   Change in the use or character of a nonconforming use.
   (B)   Every application for a zoning clearance permit shall be deemed to be
an application for a certificate of occupancy.
   (C)   Within 10 days after notification that a structure or land or part
thereof is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Planning and
Zoning Office to make a final inspection thereof and to sign a certificate of
occupancy if the structure or land or part thereof are found to comply with the
provisions of this chapter. If the signature is refused, the Planning staff
shall state the cause for the refusal in writing.
   (D)   In the event that a development is not in complete compliance with
this chapter, Planning staff may still sign the certificate of occupancy upon
receipt of a written and signed statement by the developer or property owner,
which to the planning staff’s satisfaction, specifies those items still to be
completed, the manner in which they will be completed, and a schedule for their
completion. Failure to comply with the agreement by the date specified shall
constitute a violation of this chapter and may result in the revocation of the
certificate of occupancy and/or other penalties.
(1979 Code, § 151.234) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.285 COMMITMENTS.
   Whenever a commitment may be permitted or allowed under the terms of this
chapter the following regulations shall govern the creation, form, recording,
enforcement, modification and termination of commitments.
   (A)   Creation of commitments. A commitment shall be executed by the owner
of record of the property (property owner) which is the subject of a petition
or proposal and any other party necessary to give legal effect to the terms of
the commitment. Terms of a proposed commitment shall be reviewed at a public
hearing on the petition or proposal. A commitment shall be submitted in a form
satisfactory to the body which permits or requires the commitment. The property
owner shall be responsible for prompt recording of the commitment and shall
submit evidence of recording to the Planning and Zoning Office.
   (B)   Enforcement. A commitment may be enforced by the body which permitted
or required the commitment and any specially affected persons designated in the
terms of the commitment. Specially affected persons may include, but are not
limited to owners of adjacent properties, public service organizations and
neighborhood associations. Unless modified or terminated by the body which
permitted or required the commitment, a commitment is binding upon the property
owner, a subsequent property owner and any person who acquires an interest in
the property. If, however, the commitment is not recorded, the commitment is
binding only upon the property owner and any party who has actual notice of the
commitment.
   (C)   Modification and termination. A commitment may be modified or
terminated only by a decision of the body which permitted or required the
commitment after notice to interested parties and a public hearing. Written
notice of the public hearing shall be provided to designated specially affected
persons with authority to enforce the commitment. The body which permitted or
required the commitment may modify or terminate the commitment only upon
finding that:
      (1)   A change in circumstances has occurred which makes unnecessary the
purpose for which the commitment was originally made;
      (2)   Due to a change in circumstances, the burden imposed by the
commitment constitutes an undue hardship as weighed against the interest the
commitment was intended to protect;
      (3)   The purpose of the commitment will be better served by modification
of the commitment; or
      (4)   A change in law or circumstances has rendered performance of the
commitment illegal or impossible.
(1979 Code, § 151.235) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.286 SPECIAL EXCEPTION.
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider applications only for such
special exceptions as are specifically enumerated in this chapter and, as to
each special exception that is granted, may impose such conditions on the
exercise of such special exception as the Board may deem advisable. No special
exception shall be granted by the Board unless the Board specifically finds
that:
      (1)   The special exception is so defined, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
      (2)   The special exception will not reduce the values of other
properties in its immediate vicinity; and
      (3)   The special exception shall conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is to be located.
   (B)   An application for a special exception shall be filed with the
Planning and Zoning Office in such form as may be prescribed from time to time
by the Board.
   (C)   No application for a special exception shall be considered by the
Board until the Plan Commission has considered such application and made a
recommendation to the Board based upon land use considerations only. The
recommendation by the Plan Commission shall not require a public hearing.
   (D)   The Board shall hold a public hearing on each application for a
special exception. At least 10 days prior to the date set for such hearing,
public notice of the time, date and place thereof shall be given by publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and, in addition, actual
notice of the hearing shall be given to all interested parties.
   (E)   Special exceptions shall be exercised in strict accordance with the
terms of approval thereof by the Board, provided that minor changes in the
location or use of proposed and existing structures and usage may be authorized
by the Board without a public hearing if such changes are consistent with the
purpose and intent of the terms of the original approval. Whether or not any
such change constitutes a minor change shall be determined by the Board, in its
sole discretion.
   (F)   Any use existing at the effective date of this chapter as to the land
on which such use is exercised and which use is listed as a special exception
in a zoning district under the terms of this chapter may be altered or enlarged
only if a new special exception is granted by the Board as provided in this
chapter.
   (G)   If no construction has begun or no use established within 12 months
from the approval of a special exception, the special exception shall lapse and
be of no further effect, and the provisions of this chapter which would govern
the land and its usage without regard to the special exception shall thereafter
apply, and the Planning and Zoning Office shall remove the special exception
from the zoning map.
(1979 Code, § 151.236) (Ord. 4370, passed 7-20-1998)
§ 151.287 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Procedure and requirements for approval of conditional uses. This
section is intended to provide a set of procedures and standards for specific
land uses that will allow practical latitude for the developer, but at the same
time maintain sound provisions for the protection of the health, safety and
general welfare of the residents of the city. In order to provide controllable
and reasonable flexibility, this section permits detailed review of certain
specified types of land use activities which, because of their particular and
unique characteristics, require special consideration in relation to the
welfare of adjacent properties and to the community as a whole. Land and
structure uses possessing these characteristics may be authorized when defined
and permitted within a specific zoning district by the issuance of a
conditional use permit. Through this procedure, the Board of Zoning Appeals has
the opportunity to impose conditions and safeguards that are deemed necessary
for the protection of the public welfare.
   (B)   Contents of application for a conditional use permit. An application
for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Office
and the Board of Zoning Appeals by at least one owner of the property for which
the conditional use is proposed. At minimum, the application shall contain the
following information. The Planning staff may request additional information as
needed following submission.
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   A legal description of the real estate involved;
      (3)   Description of existing use;
      (4)   Description of proposed conditional use;
      (5)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects of such elements as
noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration upon adjoining property; and a
discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and other properties in
the district;
      (6)   A site plan of the property which shall include:
         (a)   Location and size of all existing and proposed buildings and
structures;
         (b)   Location and dimensions of building lines, right-of-way lines,
setbacks, regulated drains and public and private easements (existing and
proposed);
         (c)   Elevation contours and spot elevations sufficient to determine
drainage (existing and proposed), if necessary;
         (d)   Layout of drives and other traffic features on opposite side of
street and/or adjacent properties;
         (e)   Statement of availability of city sewer and water, if required
for the proposed use; and
         (f)   Locations of parking and loading areas, traffic access and
circulation, open space, landscaping, refuse and service areas, signs, turning
radii, and proposed vehicle and projected turning paths from turning radius
templates.
      (7)   Vicinity map showing all existing land uses within a 300 foot
radius of the property; and
      (8)   Any supplemental information required for conditional use
applications specified in the regulations of the zoning district in which the
property is located.
   (C)   General standards applicable to all conditional uses. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
      (1)   Is in fact a conditional use as established under the permitted
land uses within the zoning district;
      (2)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives or with any specific objective of the city’s Comprehensive Plan and/
or the Zoning Ordinance;
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance and function with the existing or
intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential
character of the area;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed uses shall be
able to provide adequately any such services;
      (6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public expense
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      (7)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
      (8)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
      (9)   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance.
   (D)   Conditions and commitments. In granting any conditional use, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions or require the property
owner to make written commitments regarding the use and development of the
property which is the subject of the petition. Conditions or commitments may
require special screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions and
character; additional setback distances, yards and open space or other measures
necessary to ensure the compatibility of the proposed use and harmony of the
proposed development with neighboring properties and other properties within
the district. Conditions or commitments may address the following:
      (1)   Off-street parking and loading areas;
      (2)   Refuse and service areas;
      (3)   Proposed signs and exterior lighting;
      (4)   Noise, glare, odor, adverse economic effects or traffic hazards
resulting from the proposed use; and
      (5)   Any other matter requiring particular attention in order to avoid
adverse effects of the proposed use on neighboring properties and other
properties in the district.
   (E)   Notice of public hearing. Upon receipt of the application for a
conditional use permit specified above, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold
a public hearing. At least 10 days prior to the date set for such hearing,
public notice of the time, date and place thereof shall be given by publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and give written notice to
all interested parties.
   (F)   Action by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Following the public hearing,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions or disapprove the application as presented. If the application is
approved or approved with modifications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
instruct the Planning and Zoning Office in writing to issue a conditional use
permit listing the specific conditions specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals
for approval. If the application is disapproved by the Board of Zoning Appeals,
it shall notify the applicant in writing listing specific reasons for the
denial.
   (G)   Expiration of conditional use permit. A conditional use approval shall
be deemed to authorize only 1 particular use, and said approval shall
automatically expire if, for any reason, the use has not commenced within 1
year or an implemented use has been discontinued for a period of 1 year.
   (H)   Construction requirements. Any person granted conditional use approval
who fails to commence construction within 12 months after the permit is issued
or fails to conform to the provisions of the development plan approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, may be required by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon
its own motion and shall be required by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon
written petition by any third party, to show cause why the approval should not
be withdrawn and the permit revoked.
   (I)   Modifications. The holder of a zoning clearance permit for a
conditional use may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals at any time for an
alteration, modification, amendment or extension of the application or
development plan upon which the permit was based.
      (1)   Upon receipt of such application, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
proceed as in the case of original applications for a conditional use.
      (2)   In the event that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve and
order such applications or development plans modified, altered, amended or
extended, it shall notify the Planning and Zoning Office which shall issue an
amended zoning clearance permit accordingly.
      (3)   Any alteration, change or amendment to a site plan (previously
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals through the conditional use process)
and involving a new structure, combination of structures or addition to an
existing structure, may be issued a zoning clearance permit by the Planning and
Zoning Office without the requirement of a public hearing or Board of Zoning
Appeals approval provided that:
         (a)   The net increase in floor area is less than 1,000 square feet
but not to exceed 50% of the gross floor area of structures on the parcel.
         (b)   The plans for the proposed use are submitted to and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Office.
         (c)   The plans are revised to incorporate any recommendations deemed
appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Office.
         (d)   The property of the proposed use is not located within 100 feet
of the property line of any existing residential land use.

§ 151.288 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Variance from development standards. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider petitions for variances from the development standards (such as
height, bulk or area) of this chapter. As to each variance that is granted, the
Board may impose such conditions on the grant of the variance as the Board may
deem advisable. No variance shall be granted by the Board unless the Board
under this section specifically finds that:
      (1)   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the community;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property will not be
affected in a substantially adverse manner;
      (3)   Granting the variance would be consistent with the intent and
purpose of this chapter;
      (4)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land involved and which are not applicable to other lands or structures in
the same district;
      (5)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter would deprive
the applicant of the rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same
district under the provisions of this chapter;
      (6)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from any
action or inaction by the applicant; and
      (7)   In the designated flood hazard areas, the variance will not
increase flood heights, create additional threats to public safety, cause
additional public expense, create nuisances or conflict with existing laws or
ordinances.
   (B)   Variance of use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider
applications for variances from the permitted uses of this chapter. As to each
variance that is granted, the Board may impose such conditions on the grant of
the variance as the Board may deem advisable. Variances shall only be granted
by the Board pursuant to this section and §
151.124, when the Board specifically finds a showing of good and sufficient
cause that:
      (1)   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the community;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in
the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
      (3)   The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to
the property involved;
      (4)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter will constitute
an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the variance is
sought; and
      (5)   The approval does not interfere substantially with the
comprehensive plan.
   (C)   Application for variances shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning
Office in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by the Board.
   (D)   The Board shall hold a public hearing on each application for a
variance. At least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, public notice
of the time, date and place thereof shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city and, in addition, written notice
of the hearing shall be given to all interested parties.

§ 151.289 REVOCATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   In addition to the other powers granted to the Board of Zoning Appeals
(“BZA”), the BZA is hereby expressly granted the authority to revoke any
variance, conditional use or special exception previously issued.
   (B)   The BZA may revoke a variance, conditional use or special exception
whenever 1 or more of the following exist:
      (1)   The BZA determines that the variance, conditional use or special
exception was obtained by the applicant by fraudulent or misleading statements;
      (2)   That there has not been compliance with 1 or more requirement
contained in the variance, conditional use or special exception;
      (3)   That circumstances have materially changed since a variance,
conditional use or special exception was granted so that, if the sanction is
not imposed, public health, safety or welfare will be adversely affected.
   (C)   In order to revoke previously conditional uses, special exceptions,
and variances, the Board shall hold a public hearing on each appeal to revoke.
Prior to the initiation of revocation proceedings, the Zoning Administrator
shall notify the permit holder, in writing, of the specific areas of
noncompliance and specify the date by which such deficiencies must be
corrected. The permit holder shall provide the city with evidence that the
required corrective action has taken place. At least 10 days prior to the date
set for such hearing, public notice of the time, date and place thereof shall
be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and
in addition, written notice of hearing shall be given to all interested
parties.

procedure of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

prior to the date set for such hearing, public notice of the time, date and
place thereof shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general

be given to all parties interested in the hearing.
   (E)   Immediately following the filing of an appeal, all actions pursuant to
the order, requirement, decision or determination from which the appeal is
taken shall be stayed unless the Planning and Zoning staff shall certify to the
Board that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay of the action
would cause imminent peril to life and property.

to cause sickness or disease;

dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits or lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction is determined by the Fire Chief or

      (1)   Diatomite-type filters shall be designed for operation under either
pressure or vacuum. The design capacity shall not exceed 3 g.p.m. per square
foot of effective filter area for pressure filters and shall not exceed 2-1/
4 g.p.m. per square foot of effective filter area for vacuum filters.
      (2)   The determination of the filter area shall be made on a basis of a
true and effective supported septum surface. In the case of fabric septums, the
area computation will be made on the basis of measurements of the septum
support in a reasonably constant plane. Area allowance shall not be granted for
folds in the septum fabric or deviations in the septum surface which would
easily bridge.
      (3)   The tank containing the filter elements shall be constructed of
steel, plastic or other suitable material, which will satisfactorily provide
resistance to corrosion, with or without coating. Pressure filters shall be
designed for a working pressure equal to the shutoff head of the pump, with a
factory safety of 4. Vacuum filters shall be designed to withstand the pressure
developed by the weight of the water contained therein and closed vacuum
filters shall, in addition, be designed to withstand the crushing pressure
developed under a vacuum of 25 inches of mercury, both with a factory safety of
3.5. In either type filter where the tank is fabricated from material which is
corroded by water, a suitable corrosion-resistant coating shall be applied to
retard the attack.
      (4)   The filter elements shall be fabricated of corrosion-resistant
materials throughout. They shall be designed to be adequately resistant to a
differential pressure between the influent and the effluent of not less than
the maximum pressure which can be developed by the circulating pump, and shall
be of adequate strength to resist any additional stresses developed during the
cleaning operation. The filter septum, on which the filter-aid cake is
deposited, shall be provided with openings the maximum dimensions of which
shall be not greater than .005 inches.
      (5)   (a)   Provision shall be made to introduce filter aid into the
filter in such a way as to evenly precoat the filter septum before the filter
is placed in operation.
         (b)   The amount of filter aid shall be selected to provide at least
the same protection to the filter septum as would be provided by the use of l/
10 pound of diatomite filter aid per square foot of filter area.
         (c)   Use of additional equipment to provide body feed to the filter
influent is optional.
         (d)   Where provided, this equipment shall have the capacity to
continuously and uniformly feed at a rate of not less than l/10 pound of filter
aid per square foot of filter area per 24 hours.
      (6)   (a)   The filter piping shall be so designed that during the
precoating operation the effluent from the filter shall be recirculated or run
to waste and shall not be fed into the pool until free of filter aid.
         (b)   An exception to this requirement may be made if the filter
septum is of the construction that no perceptible quantity of filter aid is
introduced into the pool when the effluent discharges therein.
      (7)   Where dissimilar metals are used in the construction of the filter,
which may set up galvanic currents, suitable provision shall be made to resist
electrolytic corrosion.
      (8)   Filters shall be so designed and installed that they can readily be
disassembled and the filter elements removed.
