city employee or retired public safety employee. If the retired city employee
or retired public safety employee elects any coverage other than the single
benefits coverage offered through the city, the city shall pay an amount equal
to what it would have paid if retired city employee or retired public safety
employee had elected single coverage benefits. A retired city employee or
retired public safety employee must file a written request for additional
health insurance within 90 days after the retired city employee or retired
public safety employee qualifies for Medicare.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 37.40 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   The capital asset policy is being issued effective January 1, 2006.
This policy is being issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to
be reported on financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. This
issuance of a policy document is related to the implementation of a new
reporting model, Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. The
capital asset threshold will be $5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will
be expensed in the year of purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy
is also effective January 1, 2006.
   (B)   The city has established a capital asset policy in order to provide a
higher degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets and
to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies.
   (C)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is five-fold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of the city;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance, and retirement policies;
      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting; and
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (D)   This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board of Accounts. It does not include data processing,
programming requirements, or computer operations procedures.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.41 DEFINITION.
   (A)   CAPITAL ASSETS include land and land improvements—including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles, and infrastructure. All items with a useful life of more
than one year and having a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized
(including acquisitions by lease-purchase agreements and donated items). A
capital asset meeting the criteria will be reported in the government-wide
financial statements.
   (B)   Assets that are not capitalized (items under $5,000) are expensed in
the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers and other
equipment with a capitalized cost of under $5,000.
   (C)   Exceptions are:
      (1)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit.
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units.
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
   (D)   Note: purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant
requirements of the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.42 THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR CAPITAL ASSETS.
   The following schedule will be followed for the different types of capital
assets other than infrastructure:
Land All
Land                     All
Land improvements        $5,000
Building                 $5,000
Building improvements    $5,000
Construction in progress All
Machinery and equipment  $5,000
Vehicle                  $5,000
City utility assets      $5,000
 
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.43 VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets must be recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset but also
included is any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and intended use. Such costs could include the
following:
      (1)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
      (2)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
      (3)   Damage payments;
      (4)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
      (5)   Architect, engineering, and accounting fees;
      (6)   Insurance premiums during construction;
      (7)   Transportation charges, interest costs during construction.
   (B)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market
value on the date donated.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.44 ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system. This section further
clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
   BUILDINGS.
      (1)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment services or
functions are included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within
buildings and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such units that serve the
building.
      (2)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating
and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems, surveillance systems,
passenger and freight elevators, escalators, build-in casework, walk-in coolers
and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed equipment are included with the
building, if owned. Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as
buildings. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
   EQUIPMENT. All other types of physical property within the scope of the
fixed asset management system not previously classified. Included within this
category are office mechanical equipment, office furniture, appliances,
furnishings, machinery items, maintenance equipment, communication equipment,
police, fire, sanitation and park department, laboratory equipment, vehicles,
road equipment, aircraft, emergency equipment, earth moving equipment, text
equipment, civil defense equipment, and data processing equipment. All supplies
are excluded.
   IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS.
      (1)   Examples of civil city assets in this category are walks, parking
areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters,
underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (2)   Examples of city utilities assets in this category are water supply
mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes, and fire
hydrants.
   INFRASTRUCTURE.
      (1)   Long-lived capital that normally can be preserved for a
significantly greater number of years than most capital and that are normally
stationary in nature. Examples include roads, streetlights, traffic signals,
drainage systems, and water systems. Infrastructure assets do not include
buildings, drives, parking lots, or any other examples given above that are
incidental to property or access to the property above.
      (2)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain theexisting asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal, etc. are
considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also, normal department
operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary engineering
and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of the
infrastructure asset.
      (3)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure; the land
under alleys will be added to total land.
   LAND. Specified land, lots, parcels, or acreage including rights-of-way,
owned by the city and its various departments, boards, or authorities,
regardless of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will not be
included, as the city does not own them, but as an interest in land owned by
another that entitles its holder to a specified limited use.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.45 CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISITIONS.
   (A)   The method of acquisition is not a determining factor. Each department
should report items acquired by:
      (1)   Regular purchases.
      (2)   Lease purchase. (See division (B) of this section below.)
      (3)   Construction by city personnel.
      (4)   Construction by an outside contractor.
      (5)   Resolution/condemnation.
      (6)   Donation/contribution.
      (7)   Addition to an existing asset.
      (8)   Transfer from another department
      (9)   Trade or barter.
      (10)   Annexation.
   (B)   Lease equipment should be capitalized if the lease agreement meets any
one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the
end of the lease term.
      (2)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
      (3)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property.
      (4)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease, excluding executory costs, equals at least 90% of the fair value of
the leased property.
   (C)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be recorded
as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial statements.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.46 ASSET TRANSFERS AND DISPOSITIONS.
   (A)   Property should not be transferred, turned in for auction, or disposed
of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment out-
processing checklist should be sent to the City Clerk-Treasurer's office in all
cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any movement
of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account, department
building, floor, or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
   (B)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
      (1)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset's tag number or city ID.
      (2)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries.
      (3)   Write legibly.
      (4)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form.
      (5)   Enter information in correct row, depending on whether you are
transferring or deleting an asset.
      (6)   Have department head sign at the bottom of the form.
      (7)   Return the form to the City Clerk-Treasurer's Office.
   (C)   If an asset is stolen, the department should notify the Police
Department as well as the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.47 PERIODIC INVENTORIES.
   A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item over $5,000) will be
conducted in each department on or about December 31 of every year. The Clerk-
Treasurer's office will conduct spot checks on a random basis. Department heads
will be accountable for the capital asset inventory charged to their
departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year-end.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.48 RESPONSIBILITIES OF CLERK-TREASURER'S OFFICE.
   The fiscal officer will ensure that accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The fiscal officer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)
§ 37.49 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the head of the department to act as or
designate a steward for each piece of property. The steward will become the
focal point for questions regarding the availability, condition, and usage of
the asset, as well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
   (B)   Someone should be designated to record the receipt of the asset, to
examine the asset to make sure that no damage was incurred during shipment, and
to make sure that the asset was received in working order.
   (C)   The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary
preventative maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working
condition. It is necessary to have a responsible person available for questions
that arise during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the
asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it
was acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition,
the steward should report any property damage or theft.
(Ord. 2005-24, passed 9-19-05)

training programs;
      (6)   A copy of a written plan for employee drug testing that:
         (a)   Covers all employees of the bidder who will perform work on the

(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.61 POST-BID SUBMISSIONS FROM SUBCONTRACTORS.
   (A)   All bidders shall provide a written list that discloses the name,
address, and type of work for each first-tier subcontractor from whom the
bidder has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on any part of the public work
project, including individuals performing work as independent contractors,
within five business days after the date the bids are due. A first tier
subcontractor is defined as a subcontractor holding a subcontract with a prime
contractor and/or bidder.
   (B)   In addition, each such first-tier subcontractor shall be required to
adhere to the requirements of §
30.60 as though it were bidding directly to the city, except that first-tier
subcontractors shall submit the required information (including the name,
address, and type of work for each of their first-tier subcontractors) to the
successful bidder no later than five business days after the subcontractor's
first day of work on the public work project and the bidder shall then forward
said information to the city. Payment shall be withheld from any first-tier
subcontractor who fails to timely submit said information until such
information is submitted and approved by the city.
   (C)   Upon request, the city may require any second and lower-tier
subcontractors to provide the required information (including name, address,
type of work on the project and the name of the higher-tier subcontractor). A
SECOND AND LOWER TIER SUBCONTRACTOR is defined by a subcontractor hired or
holding a contract with the first-tier contractor or lower subcontractor.
Payments shall be withheld from any second or lower-tiered contractor who fails
to timely submit this information until this information is submitted and
approved by the city. Additionally, the city may require the successful bidder
and relevant subcontractor to remove the second or lower-tier subcontractor
from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible
subcontractor.
   (D)   Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall
not disqualify the successful bidder from performing work on the project and
shall not constitute a contractual default and/or breach by the successful
bidder. However, the city may withhold all payments otherwise due for work
performed by a subcontractor, until the subcontractor submits the required
information and the city approves such information. The city may also require
that successful bidder to remove the subcontractor from the project and replace
it with a responsive and responsible subcontractor.
   (E)   The disclosure of a subcontractor ("disclosed subcontractor") by a
bidder or a subcontractor shall not create any rights in the disclosed
subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor may substitute another
subcontractor ("substitute subcontractor") for a disclosed subcontractor by
giving the city written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the
substitute subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is subject to all of the
obligations of a subcontractor under this section.
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.62 VALIDITY OF PRE-QUALIFICATION CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Upon designation by the city that a contractor's or subcontractor's
submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and upon any
further consideration deemed necessary by the city, the contractor or
subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future city public works projects. A
contractor's classification as "qualified" shall exempt the contractor or
subcontractor from the comprehensive submission requirements contained herein
for a period of 12 months. Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are
pre-qualified must submit a complete application for continuation of "pre-
qualified" standing, on a form provided by the city, (also referred to as the
"short form") by December 31 for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any
pre-qualified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete
application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing shall result in
automatic removal of the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year.
However, the "removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to
bid on city public works projects.
   (B)   Any material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within ten days of its occurrence to the city. The pre-
qualification designation is solely within the discretion of the city and the
city specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the designation for a
stated written reason(s).
   (C)   Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded
to the contractor within seven working days of such decision. Any contractor
denied or losing pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the
decision by submitting such request in writing to the city within five business
days of receipt of notice of denial.
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.63 INCOMPLETE SUBMISSIONS BY BIDDERS.
   It is the sole responsibility of the potential bidder to comply with all
submission requirements applicable to the bidder in §
30.60 by no later than the public bid opening. Post-bid submissions must be
submitted in accordance with §
30.61. Submissions deemed inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by the city may
result in the automatic disqualification of the bid.
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.64 RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER DETERMINATION.
   The city, after review of complete and timely submissions, shall, in its
sole discretion, after taking into account all information in the submission
requirements, determine whether a bidder is responsive and responsible. The
city specifically reserves the right to utilize all information provided in the
contractor or subcontractor's submission or any information obtained by the
city through its own independent verification of the information provided by
the contractor.
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.65 CERTIFIED PAYROLL.
   (A)   For projects in which the cost is at least $250,000, the successful
bidder and all subcontractors working on a public work project shall submit a
certified payroll report utilizing the federal form now known as a WH-347 which
must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the city within ten
calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor
performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports
shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g.
journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician.
   (B)   The city may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if
the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time
as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The city may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified
payroll reports are submitted. The city shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports.
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.66 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   All information submitted by a bidder or a subcontractor pursuant to this
section, including certified payrolls, are public records subject to review
pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records law (I.C. 5-14-3).
(Ord. 2018-5, passed 5-7-18)
§ 30.67 PENALTIES FOR FALSE, DECEPTIVE OR FRAUDULENT STATEMENTS/INFORMATION.
   Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false,
deceptive or fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or
fraudulent information in connection with any submission made to the city shall
be disqualified from bidding on all city projects for a period of three years
and may be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum term of
imprisonment of 365 days and a maximum fine of $5,000.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 51.060 RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (B)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (C)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall

at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated once every year to ensure their accuracy.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (F)   After an inspection of a grease trap, the Superintendent may re-
inspect the user's property anytime within six months, and if after said re-
inspection it is found that the user is not in compliance with this item, then
a re-inspection fee of $40 may be assessed on the user's next utility bill.

51.999
§ 51.061 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as par of a routine inspection and sampling program of
the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from
the Winchester City Court.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 51.070 GENERALLY.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data"
as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.

§ 51.080 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter or order issued hereunder, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. The
offender shall, within the period of time stated in such Notice, provide to the
Superintendent an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Superintendent to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
§ 51.081 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
§ 51.082 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues

the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
§ 51.083 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 51.090 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may petition the Winchester City Court through the city's
attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.
(Ord. 2008-1, passed 1-21-08)
§ 51.091 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The

Appendix A:    Tables and Figures
§ 52.01 TITLE.
   This chapter will be known and may be cited and referred to as the "Storm
Drainage Control Ordinance of Winchester, Indiana" and will hereafter be
referred to as "this chapter."
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)
§ 52.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving
Randolph County may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm
water runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or agricultural use to
a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment from
developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
   (B)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Board that the storage and
controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of all new major
subdivision residential development, commercial, industrial, and institutional
development, and any commercial, industrial or institutional redevelopment in
or within two miles of the corporate limits of the city. The release rate of
storm water from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the
land area in its present land use.
   (C)   If it is determined that the standard release rate of storm water has
contributed to or caused flooding in the existing state, the allowable release
rate may be reduced to a lower limit. Conversely, there are some circumstances
where detention is not justified and may be waived by the Board.
   (D)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage
tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each
proposed project be discussed with the City's Engineer or Street Commissioner
at the earliest practical time in the planning stage.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)
§ 52.03 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall become effective after its final passage, approval and
publication as required by law. The affected land shall be the applicable land
area within the city, contiguous to the city, or within a two-mile radius of
the existing corporation limits of the city. Any residential major subdivision,
or commercial, industrial or institutional development or construction project
thereon, which has had its drainage plan approved by the Board and has
initiated construction activities consistent with the approved plan prior to
the effective date of this chapter shall be exempt from all of the requirements
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)
§ 52.04 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed as additional requirements to
minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city. In the case of
conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)
§ 52.05 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement
plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections, appeals, and
similar matters, and compliance with applicable State of Indiana statutes and
regulations shall be required.
   (A)   Permits for construction in a floodway.
      (1)   The 1945 Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) of the State of Indiana
prohibits the construction of abodes or residences in or on a floodway. Flood
Hazard Management Ordinance says that prior approval of the Department of
Natural Resources is required for any type of construction, excavation, or
filling in or on a floodway. All projects proposed to be located in a floodway
must also comply with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   All applications made to and granted approval by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) do not in any way relieve a property
owner of the necessity of securing easements or other property rights, permits
or approvals from affected property owners and/or local, state and federal
agencies.
   (B)   Compliance with 327 IAC 15-5. All land disturbing activities including
subdivision development and individual commercial, industrial and institutional
site development that disturb five acres or more in total must comply with 327
IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) "Storm Water Runoff Associated With Construction Activity".
It shall be the responsibility of the landowners or developers to determine if
this rule applies to their project. The Board will make no determination of the
applicability of this rule to individual projects. Copies of the Notice of
Intent (NOI) letters shall also be filed with the Area Plan Commission prior to
the start of land disturbing activity.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)

text of this chapter and any illustration or diagram, the text shall control.
   (C)   The word "person" includes a firm, association, organization,
partnership, trust, company, corporation, or other legal entity, as well as an
individual.
   (D)   Words used in the present tense shall include the future; and words
used in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the
singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
   (E)   The word "shall" is always the mandatory and not discretionary; the
word "may" is permissive; the word "should" is a preferred requirement.
   (F)   The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for", "designed for",
"intended for", "maintained for", "constructed for", "converted for", "altered
for", or "occupied for".
   (G)   The word "lot" includes the words "metes and bounds tract", "legally
platted lot", or "parcel".
   (H)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a regulation
involves two or more items, conditions, provisions, or events connected by the
conjunction "and", "or", or "either ...or", the conjunction shall be
interpreted as follows:
      (1)   "And" indicates that all the connected items, conditions,
provisions, or events shall apply.
      (2)   "Or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions, or
events may apply singly or in any combination.

§ 52.08 STORM WATER CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that (with the possible exception of the White River
and Mississinewa River) the smaller streams and drainage channels serving
Randolph County may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm
water runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage
and controlled release rate of excess storm water runoff shall be required for
any new major subdivision residential development, commercial, industrial or
institutional development, and any commercial, industrial or institutional
redevelopment in Randolph County.
   (B)   Exceptions to the requirement are minor subdivisions as described in
the Subdivision Control Ordinance. In addition, the Board, after thorough
investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff
set-out in this chapter.
   (C)   The release rate of storm water from development, redevelopments, and
new construction requiring controlled release may not exceed the storm water
runoff from the land area in its present state of development. The developer
must submit to the Board detailed computations of runoff before and after
development, redevelopment or new construction, which demonstrate that runoff
will not be increased.
   (D)   These computations must show that the peak runoff rate after
development for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration must not
exceed the 10-year return period pre-development peak runoff rate. The critical
duration storm is that storm duration that requires the greatest detention
storage.

§ 52.10 DETERMINATION OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development. The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a given
rainfall intensity may be calculated as follows:
   (A)   Area less than or equal to 200 acres.
      (1)   For areas up to and including 200 acres, the rational method may be
used. Typical runoff coefficients are listed herein. In the rational method,
the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic feet per second is computed as:
   Q=CIA
where C = runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the drainage
area and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall. I = average intensity of
rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration
(tc) for a selected rainfall frequency. A = tributary drainage area in acres.
Guidance to selection of the runoff coefficient "C" is provided by
Table 1 and
Table 2 which show values for different types of surface and local soil
characteristics. The composite "C" value used for a given drainage area with
various surface types shall be the weighted average value for the total area
calculated from a breakdown of individual areas having different surface types.
      (2)   
Table 3 provides runoff coefficients and inlet times for different land use
classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land situated in an upstream
area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for this area in its present
or existing state of development.
      (3)   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the data shown in
Table 6. The time of concentration (tc) to be used shall be the sum of the
inlet time and flow time in the drainage facility from the most remote part of
the drainage area to the point under consideration. The flow time in the storm
sewers may be estimated by the distance in feet divided by velocity of flow in
feet per second. The velocity shall be determined by the Manning Formula.
      (4)   Time of concentration (tc) is the combined time required for the
runoff to reach the inlet of the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time
and flow time through established surface drainage channels such as swales,
ditches and sheet flow across such areas as lawns, fields, and other graded
surfaces. It may be computed by using
Figure 1.
   (B)   For areas greater than 200 acres. For areas larger than 200 acres,
hydrograph techniques and/or computer modeling methods may be used. Hydrograph
techniques and computer modeling methods used to determine storm water runoff
shall be proven methods, subject to approval of the Board. (See also §
52.15(F).)

§ 52.11 AMOUNT OF RUNOFF TO BE ACCOMMODATED BY VARIOUS PARTS OF THE DRAINAGE
FACILITY.
   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows:
   (A)   Minor drainage systems.
      (1)   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street
gutters, swales, sewers and small channels that collect storm water must
accommodate peak runoff from a 10-year return period storm. Rainfall duration
shall be equal to the time of concentration or one hour if the time of
concentration is less than one hour. A first quartile storm distribution shall
be used for computer modeling. The allowable spread of water on arterial and
collector streets is limited to maintaining two clear 10-foot moving lanes of
traffic. One lane is to be maintained on local streets, while marginal access
streets can have a water spread equal to one-half of their width.
      (2)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic feet per
second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year return
period storm within the drainage easement.
      (3)   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff from a 50-
year return period storm when crossing under a road which is part of the
Indiana Department of Transportation rural functional classification system and
are classified as principal or minor arterial, major or minor collector roads.
   (B)   Major drainage systems. Major drainage systems are defined in §
52.07 and shall be designed in accordance with Indiana Department of Natural
Resources standards.
(Ord. 2001-01, passed 1-15-01; Am. Ord. 2011-7, passed 7-18-11)
§ 52.12 STORM SEWER DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All storm sewers, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public property shall conform to the design standards and other
requirements contained herein.
   (A)   Hydraulic capacity. The hydraulic capacity of storm sewers shall be
determined using Manning's Equations:
 
V = 1.486 R2/3 S½
    n
 
      V = mean velocity of flow in feet per second
      R = the hydraulic radius in feet
      S = the slope of the energy grade line in feet per foot
      n = roughness coefficient
   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross sectional area of flow
divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted perimeter. Typical "n" values and
maximum permissible velocities for storm sewer materials are listed in
Table 4. Roughness coefficient (n) values for other sewer materials can be
found in standard hydraulics texts and references.
   (B)   Minimum size. The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be 12 inches.
Rate of release for detention storage shall be controlled by an orifice plate
or other devices, subject to approval of the Board, where the 12-inch pipe will
not limit rate of release as required.
   (C)   Grade. Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two
feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less than the
minimum may be used only upon approval of the Board. Uniform slopes shall be
maintained between inlets, manholes and inlets to manholes. Final grade shall
be set with full consideration of the capacity required, sedimentation problems
and other design parameters. Minimum and maximum allowable slopes shall be
those capable of producing velocities of 2½ and 15 feet per second,
respectively, when the sewer is flowing full.
   (D)   Alignment. Storm sewers shall be straight between manholes insofar as
possible. Where long radius curves are necessary to conform to street layout,
the minimum radius of curvature shall be no less than 100 feet for sewers 42
inches and larger in diameter. Deflection of pipe sections shall not exceed the
maximum deflection recommended by the pipe manufacturer. The deflection shall
be uniform and finished installation shall follow a smooth curve.
   (E)   Backfill requirements. Any storm sewer constructed within a street
dedicated to the city must be approved by the Street Commissioner, City
Engineer, or designee, prior to construction. Storm sewers constructed within a
Randolph County Highway must be approved by the Randolph County Highway
Supervisor, or designee, prior to construction. Any sewer constructed within
five feet of an existing or proposed street, alley, driveway, or sidewalk shall
be backfilled with granular material. Granular backfill shall be crushed or
washed stone compacted to 95% maximum density. Granular backfill shall extend
from the bottom of the trench excavation to the restoration materials. Pavement
restoration shall be a minimum four-inches thick consisting of three inches of
bituminous intermediate binder and one inch of bituminous surface, or match
existing pavement section, whichever is thicker.
   (F)   Allowable outlet location.  
      (1)   It shall be illegal to outlet the discharge pipe, emergency
spillway, tile underdrain, or any other water discharge structure from a wet or
dry retention/detention basin, or any storm sewers, sump pump drains, downspout
drains, perimeter septic system tile drains, farm tile drains, foundation or
floor drains into the right-of-way of any roadway including all Randolph County
roads, state highways, federal highways, private streets, regulated open or
tile drains, onto adjacent property, etc., without the written approval of the
agency having jurisdiction over the roadway, regulated drain, or the owner of
the property upon which the water will flow. Outletting of subsurface tile
drains into a six or eight inch outlet tile or open channel of a legal drain
located within a county road right-of-way and which has been designed to serve
such a purpose shall be permitted subject to plan approval of the County
Surveyor or the County Highway Supervisor.
      (2)   The excavation, filling, paving, and/or any other type of
construction of roadside drainage ditches located within Randolph County
Highway right-of-ways is PROHIBITED. Exceptions may be granted by the Drainage
Board or the Randolph County Highway Superintendent and must be in writing
PRIOR to beginning construction. Extension and paving of existing driveways
within the road right-of-way shall be required to extend existing culverts and
must seek and receive driveway construction approval from the Randolph County
Highway Department.
   (G)   Manholes.  
      (1)   Manholes shall be installed to provide access to continuous
underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.
Manholes shall be provided at the following locations:
         (a)   Where two or more storm sewers converge.

point of reverse curvature (PC, PT, PRC).
         (c)   Where pipe size changes.
         (d)   Where an abrupt change in alignment occurs.
         (e)   Where a change in grade occurs.
         (f)   At suitable intervals in straight sections of sewer.
      (2)   The maximum distance between storm sewer manholes shall be as
follows:
 
Size of Pipe (inches) Maximum Distance (feet)
12 thru 42            400
48 and larger         600
 
   (H)   Inlets. Inlets or drainage structures shall be utilized to collect
surface water through grated openings and convey it to storm sewers, channels
or culverts. Inlet design and spacing shall be in accordance with Section 36-
2.08 of the Indiana Department of Transportation's Design Manual Part IV -
Volume 2 or other approved design procedure. The inlet grate opening provided
must be adequate to pass the design ten-year flow with 50% of the sag inlet
areas clogged. An overload channel from sag inlets to the overflow channel or
basin shall be provided at sag inlets, so that the maximum depth of water that
might be ponded in the street sag shall not exceed seven inches.
   (I)   Workmanship and materials.
      (1)   Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm
sewers shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition

§ 52.13 OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other design
requirements contained herein.
   (A)   Hydraulic capacity. The waterway for channels shall be determined
using Manning's Equation.
 
Q = AV = A 1.486 R2/3 S½
         n
 
   Where:      A = Waterway area of channel in square feet
         Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs)
         V, R, S and n are explained in §
52.12(A).
   (B)   Channel cross section and grade. The required channel cross section
and grade are determined by the design capacity, the material in which the
channel is to be constructed, and the requirements for maintenance. A minimum
depth may be required to provide adequate outlets for subsurface drains,
tributary ditches, or streams. The channel grade shall be such that the
velocity in the channel is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough to
prevent erosion. Velocities less than one and one-half feet per second should
be avoided because siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel
cross section. The maximum permissible velocities in vegetal-lined channels are
shown in
Table 7. Developments through which the channel is to be constructed must be
considered in design of the channel section.
   (C)   Side slopes. Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than 3 to
1. Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease of
maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper than
1½ to 1 with adequate provisions made for weep holes. Side slopes steeper than
1½ to 1 may be used for lined channels provided that the side lining and
structural retaining wall are designed and constructed with provisions for live
and dead load surcharge.
   (D)   Channel stability.
      (1)   Definition. Characteristics of a stable channel are:
         (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits.
         (b)   The channel banks do no erode to the extent that the channel
cross section is changed appreciably.
         (c)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop.
         (d)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere.
         (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
      (2)   Aged conditions. Channel stability shall be determined for an aged
condition and velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full flow,
whichever is greater, using "n" values for various channel linings as shown in
Table 4. In no case is it necessary to check channel stability for discharges
greater than that from a 100-year return period storm.
      (3)   Post construction. Channel stability must be checked for conditions
immediately after construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall
be calculated for the expected flow from a 10-year return period storm on the
watershed, or the bank full flow, whichever is smaller. The "n" value for newly
constructed channels in fine-grained soils and sands may be determined in
accordance with the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil
Conservation Service and shall not exceed 0.025. The allowable velocity in the
newly constructed channel may be increased by a maximum of 20% to reflect the
effects of vegetation to be established under the following conditions:
         (a)   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed are
suitable for rapid establishment and support erosion controlling vegetation.
         (b)   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted to the area,
and proven methods of establishment are shown.
         (c)   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment of
vegetation on the channel side slopes.
   (E)   Drainage of waterways. Vegetated waterways and dry-detention basins
with a gradient of less than one percent that are subject to low flows of long
duration, or where wet conditions prevail shall be provided with a subsurface
tile drain to keep the channel bottom relatively dry and to prevent the
establishment of weed or cattail growth. Subsurface tile drain lines may be
outlet through a drop structure at the end of the waterway, through a standard
tile outlet pipe or outlet into the storm sewer system. Sub-surface drainage
tiles shall be installed with two feet of cover over the top of the tile and
shall be offset from the centerline of the channel.
   (F)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   The design of channels will provide all structures required for the
proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto and travelways for
operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and structures needed for entry of
surface and subsurface flow into channels without significant erosion or
degradation shall be included in the design of channel improvements. The design
is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water level control devices, and
any other appurtenance affecting the functioning of the channels and the
attainment of the purpose for which they are built.
      (2)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts, bridges,
buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and subsurface
drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be evaluated
to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts and bridges
which are modified or added as part of channel improvement projects shall meet
reasonable standard for the type of structure, and shall have a minimum
capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency design
requirements, whichever is greater.
   (G)   Disposition of spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing
and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner which will:
      (1)   Minimize overbank wash.
      (2)   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel and
floodplain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based on
continuous dikes being installed.
      (3)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance.
      (4)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible, consistent
with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner.
      (5)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the extent
feasible.
      (6)   Be approved by the IDNR or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (whichever
is applicable) if deposited in the floodway.
   (H)   Construction and materials.
      (1)   Construction. Specifications shall be in keeping with the current
standards of engineering practice and shall describe the requirements for
proper installation of the project to achieve its intended purpose.
      (2)   Materials.
         (a)   Materials acceptable for use as channel lining are:
            1.   Grass;
            2.   Revetment riprap;
            3.   Concrete;
            4.   Hand-laid riprap;
            5.   Precast cement concrete riprap;
            6.   Grouted riprap; or
            7.   Gabions.
         (b)   Other lining materials shall receive specific approval of the
Board. Materials shall comply with the latest edition of the Indiana Department
of Transportation's "Standard Specifications".

§ 52.15 STORM WATER DETENTION.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of storm water runoff.
   (A)   Acceptable detention methods. The increased storm water runoff
resulting from a proposed residential major subdivision, commercial,
industrial, or institutional development should be detained on- site by the
provisions of appropriate wet or dry bottom reservoirs, by storage on parking
lots, streets, lawns, or other acceptable techniques. Measures which retard the
rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to
control the runoff rate partially. Detention basins shall be sized to store
excess flows from storms with a 100-year return period. Control devices shall
limit the discharge to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this chapter
(see §
52.15(E) and (F)).
   (B)   Design storm. Design of storm water detention facilities shall be
based on a return period of once in 100 years. The storage volume and outflow
rate shall be sufficient to handle storm water runoff from a critical duration
storm, as defined in §
52.15(E) and (F). Rainfall depth-duration-frequency relationships and
intensity-duration-frequency relationships shall be those given in
Tables 5 and
6.
   (C)   Allowable release rate.
      (1)   The allowable release rate of storm water originating from a
proposed residential major subdivision, commercial, industrial, or
institutional development shall not exceed the amount specified in §
52.08, and as described in §
52.15(E) and (F).
      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system
is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the
allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity
of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional
detention shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the
capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.
      (3)   If more than one detention basin is involved in the development of
the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from
any one detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its
drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.
   (D)   Drainage system overflow design. Drainage systems shall have adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all upstream tributary areas
through the development under consideration for a storm of 100-year design
return period calculated on the basis of the upstream land in its present state
of development. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate
provided, shall be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and
release rate have previously been approved by the Board and evidence of its
construction can be shown.
   (E)   Determination of storage volume - rational method. For areas of 200
acres or less, the rational method may be used to determine the required volume
of storm water storage. The following 11 step procedure may be used to
determine the required volume of storage. Other design methods may also be
used, subject to approval of the Board, and as described in §
52.15(F).
      Steps      Procedure
      (1)   Determine total drainage area in acres "A".
      (2)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cu" based on existing land
use (undeveloped).
      (3)   Determine time of concentration "tc" in minutes based on existing
conditions.
      (4)   Determine rainfall intensity "lu" in inches per hour, based on time
of concentration from data given in
Table 6 for the ten year return period.
      (5)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped), and ten
year return period:
         Qu = CuIuA
      (6)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cd" based on developed
conditions and a 100 year return period.
      (7)   Determine the 100 year return period rainfall intensity "Id" for
various storm durations "td" up through the time of concentration for the
developed area using
Table 6.
      (8)   Determine developed inflow rates "Qd" for various storm durations
"td" measured in hours.
         Qd = CdIdA
      (9)   Compute a storage rate "Std" for various storm durations "td" up
through the time of concentration of the developed area.
         Std = Qd - Qu
      (10)   Compute required storage volume "SR" in acre-feet for each storm
duration "td". This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (2*td) hours
with the peak flow of Std at td hours.
         SR = Std (td/12)
      (11)   Select the largest storage volume computed in step 10 for
detention basin design.
   (F)   Determination of storage volume - other methods. Methods other than
the rational method for determining runoff and routing of storm water may be
used to determine the storage volume required to control storm water runoff.
The procedures or methods used must receive the prior approval of the Board.
The ILLUDAS, TR-20 and TR-55 models are approved by the Board for appropriate
use in analysis of the runoff and routing of storm water. The use of these
models or other approved procedures can be defined in a seven step procedure to
determine the required storage volume of the detention basin.
      Steps      Procedure
      (1)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of storm water.
      (2)   For each storm duration listed in
Table 5, perform steps three through six.
      (3)   Determine the ten year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this flow by
Q10u
      (4)   Determine the 100 year runoff hydrograph (H100d) for developed
conditions.
      (5)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (H100s) by subtracting
a flow up to Q10u from the hydrograph (H100d) found in step 4.
      (6)   Determine the volume of water (Vs) to be stored by calculating the
area under the hydrograph (H100s).
      (7)   The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(Vs) found for any storm duration analyzed in step 6.
   (G)   General detention basin design requirements. Basins shall be
constructed to detain temporarily the storm water runoff which exceeds the
maximum peak flow rate authorized by this chapter. The volume of storage
provided in these basins, together with such storage as may be authorized in
other on-site facilities shall be sufficient to control excess runoff from the
100 year storm. The following design principles shall be observed:
      (1)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at the
design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48
hours unless additional storms occur within the period.
      (2)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored (without a
permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet.
      (3)   All storm water detention facilities shall be separated by not less
than 50 feet from any building or structure to be occupied.
      (4)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features such as sliding hills, sports fields, etc.
Slopes no steeper than 4 horizontal to 1 vertical for safety, erosion control,
stability and ease of maintenance shall be permitted.
      (5)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of four inches shall be
provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from
crawling into the structures.
      (6)   Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of
deep water, possible flooding conditions during storm periods and other dangers
that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed necessary by the Board.
      (7)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply as
possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper
operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned downstream
channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum authorized
peak flow rate.
      (8)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall be
provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention.
      (9)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required.
      (10)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be
performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.
      (11)   A report shall be submitted to the Board describing the proposed
development; the current land use conditions; the method of hydraulic and
hydrologic analysis used, including any assumptions or special conditions; the
results of the analysis; and the recommended drainage control facilities.
Hydraulic and hydrologic calculations, including input and output files, shall
be included as appendices to the report.
   (H)   Dry bottom basin design requirements. Detention basins which will not
contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated to facilitate complete interior
drainage of dry bottom basins, to include the provisions of natural grades to
outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage
facilities, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   The detention basin shall, whenever possible, be designed to serve
a secondary or multipurpose function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic
qualities (open spaces) or other types of use shall be considered in planning
the detention facility.
   (I)   Wet bottom basin design requirements. Where part of a detention basin
will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items required for detention
storage shall apply except that the system of drains with a positive gravity
outlet required to maintain a dry bottom basin will not be required. A
controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain the design water level
in the wet bottom basin and provide required detention storage above the design
water level. However, the following additional conditions shall apply:
      (1)   Basins designed with permanent pools or containing permanent ponds
shall have a water area of at least one-half acre. If fish are to be maintained
in the pond, a minimum depth of approximately ten feet shall be maintained over
at least 25% of the pond area. The remaining pond area shall have no extensive
shallow areas, except as required by division (I)(3) below.
      (2)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the pond shall be
stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered to be
stable.
      (3)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and must be
installed in all ponds approximately 30 to 36 inches below the permanent water
level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18 inches above the
permanent water line shall be provided. The slope between the two ledges shall
be stable and of a material such as stone or riprap which will prevent erosion
due to wave action.
      (4)   A safety ramp exit from the pond is required in all cases and shall
have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope to 6 horizontal to 1 vertical.
The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent its deterioration due to
vehicle use and/or wave action.
      (5)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control weed and
larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the easy removal
of sediment which will accumulate during periods of pond operation. A means of
maintaining the designed water level of the pond during prolonged periods of
dry weather is also required.
      (6)   For emergency use, basin cleaning or shoreline maintenance,
facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary equipment to
permit emptying and drainage.
      (7)   Facilities to enhance and maintain pond water quality shall be
provided, if required to meet applicable water quality standards. Design
calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities
shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual
operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the
satisfaction of the Board.
   (J)   Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of storm waters on all or a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters slowly.
Depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles is not
impaired. Ponding should, in general, be confined to those positions of the
parking lots farthest from the area served.
   (K)   Facility financial responsibilities. The construction cost of storm
water control systems and facilities as required by this chapter shall be
accepted as part of the cost of land development. If general public use of the
facility can be demonstrated, negotiations for public participation in the cost
of such development may be considered.
   (L)   Facility maintenance responsibility.
      (1)   See §
52.16(C) concerning detention basins within residential major subdivisions.
      (2)   On commercial, industrial and institutional developments,
maintenance of detention facilities during construction and thereafter shall be
the responsibility of the land developer/owner.
   (M)   Inspections. All public and privately owned detention storage
facilities shall be inspected not less often than once every five years. For
commercial, industrial and institutional sites, the property owner shall
provide a certified inspection report by a licensed professional engineer or
land surveyor covering physical conditions, available storage capacity and
operational condition of key facility elements to the Board. For inspections
within major subdivisions, see §
52.16(C)(3).
   (N)   Corrective measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector, the
owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to take the
necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so,
the city will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights,
if necessary.
   (O)   Joint development of control systems. Storm water control systems may
be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as
compliance with this chapter is maintained.
   (P)   Installation of control systems. Runoff and erosion control systems
shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development.
Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional ten percent of
available capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from
development and to permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between
cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific
locations so that removal costs are kept to a minimum.
   (Q)   Detention facilities in floodplains. If detention storage is provided
within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which
naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No
credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood
at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
   (R)   Off-site drainage provisions. When the allowable runoff is released in
an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be required to
construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert increased flood
hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one point instead of
the natural overland distribution. The requirement of off-site drains shall be
at the discretion of the Board.

§ 52.16 EXISTING REGULATED DRAINS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF URBAN REGULATED DRAINS.
   The Randolph County Drainage Board has established a system of regulated
rural and urban drains as shown on official maps located in the office of the
Randolph County Surveyor. Maintenance and administrative jurisdiction over
these drains is empowered to the Drainage Board by I.C. 36-9-27-15.
   (A)   Drainage easements. When an existing regulated drain is within the
property to be developed, easements must be provided to cover all elements of
the drainage system and must be designed as follows:
      (1)   To be adequate to install, access, and maintain the drainage
facilities;
      (2)   To minimize conflicts with utility easements; and
      (3)   To maintain a sufficient buildable area on each lot or parcel.
      (4)   No trees, shrubs, or other vegetative obstructions shall be allowed
within drainage easements per I.C. 36-9-27-33.
      (5)   No driveways shall be allowed in drainage easements except for the
purpose of crossing a front yard drainage easement to provide access to the
property.
      (6)   Minimum drainage easements are as per I.C. 36-9-27-33.
   (B)   Existing regulated drains.  
      (1)   No individual may dredge, reconstruct, fill, or outlet any drainage
tile or storm sewer pipe into a Randolph County regulated drain without the
prior written approval of the Drainage Board. The Randolph County Surveyor, or
designated representative, shall supervise any work done to a regulated drain
by any individual granted such written authorization from the Drainage Board.
      (2)   The Drainage Board may levy assessments to property owners within a
regulated drain's watershed in order to maintain the drain in accordance with
I.C. 36-9-27-44 and to reconstruct a regulated drain in accordance with I.C.
36-9-27-50.
      (3)   As per I.C. 36-9-27-66, whenever land has been assessed as
benefited by the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of a regulated
drain and there is not an open or tiled drain connecting the land with the
regulated drain or the waters from the land flow over or through land owned by
others to reach the regulated drain, the owner of the land assessed may
petition the Drainage Board to construct through the land of the other owners a
new drain that will connect the petitioner's lands with the regulated drain.
      (4)   A private crossing, control dam, or other permanent structure or
obstruction may not be placed over or through a regulated drain unless the
plans for the structure have been reviewed by the Randolph County Surveyor and
approved in writing by the Drainage Board.
   (C)   Establishment of urban regulated drains. The Drainage Board shall
require that developers of major residential subdivisions create an urban
regulated drain as part of the major subdivision plat. The urban regulated
drain shall include all storm sewers, subsurface drains, inlets, manholes, and
detention basins within the subdivision.
      (1)   Urban regulated drainage easements shall maintain a minimum width
of 20 feet centered over all closed conduits or 20 feet each side of an open
urban regulated drain or detention basin.
      (2)   A minimum 15 feet wide access easement shall be platted between the
detention basin and the nearest public street right-of-way.
      (3)   The County Surveyor shall establish a schedule for the assessment
of each lot in the subdivision in an amount not to exceed $100 per lot per year
to provide an accumulating maintenance and repair fund. These funds can be used
to inspect repair and maintain storm sewers, curb inlets, manholes, subsurface
tile drains, outlet pipes, and detention basins in the subdivision. Within the
context of this chapter, mowing shall not be defined as a maintenance activity
covered by an assessment. Individual property owners shall maintain
responsibility for mowing portions of the urban regulated drain within and
adjacent to each individual lot.

§ 52.17 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS AND OTHER LAND DISTURBING
ACTIVITIES.
   (A)   Driveway requirements. Any site that derives access from a city street
shall be required to obtain approval from the Street Commissioner, or designee,
prior to installation of a new access to the street. Any site that derives
access from a Randolph County highway shall be required to obtain approval from
the Randolph County Highway Supervisor, or designee, prior to installation of a
new access to the highway. A drainage culvert for the purpose of conveying
water from the roadside ditch underneath the driveway shall be required to be
placed under all driveways entering onto a county road, unless a culvert is
deemed unnecessary by the Randolph County Highway Supervisor. The minimum size
for such a culvert shall be 12 inches in diameter and 30 feet in length. The
size of the drainage culvert shall provide capacity for the flow from a 25-year
design return period storm.
   (B)   Allowable drainage outlet. It shall be illegal to outlet any storm
sewers, sump pump drains, downspout drains, perimeter septic system tile
drains, farm tile drains, foundation or floor drains into the right-of-way of
any roadway including all Randolph County roads, state highways, federal
highways, private streets, regulated open or tile drains, onto adjacent
property, and the like, without the written approval of the agency having
jurisdiction over the roadway, regulated drain, or the owner of the property
upon which the water will flow. Outletting of subsurface tile drains into a six
or eight inch outlet tile or open channel of a legal drain located within a
county road right-of-way and which has been designed to serve such a purpose
shall be permitted subject to plan approval of the County Surveyor or the
County Highway Supervisor.
   (C)   Maintenance of existing roadside ditches. The excavation, filling,
paving, and/or any other type of construction of roadside drainage ditches
located within Randolph County Highway right-of-ways is PROHIBITED. Exceptions
may be granted by the Drainage Board or the Randolph County Highway
Superintendent and must be in writing PRIOR to beginning construction.
Extension and paving of existing driveways within the road right-of-way shall
be required to extend existing culverts and must seek and receive driveway
construction approval from the Randolph County Highway Department.
   (D)   Road cuts and restoration. Any excavation within a city street must be
approved by the Street Commissioner, or designee, prior to construction. Any
excavation within a Randolph County highway must be approved by the Randolph
County Highway Supervisor, or designee, prior to construction. All excavation
and spoil removal is the responsibility of the development owner. On county
roadways, the County Highway Department will provide and install backfill and
pavement restoration materials given 48 hours notice prior to construction.

section shall not apply to a vehicle stored in an enclosed building or to

adequate if the Chief of Police or his designee causes that notice to be
affixed to the vehicle or upon the door of any residence located on the
property where the vehicle is found or delivering the notice in person, by
certified mail, or by leaving the notice affixed to the door and mailing a copy

      (6)   A copy of the ordinance should be attached;
      (7)   A statement indicating that if the vehicle is not removed from the

in violation of this section and the person to whom the notice is directed
could be subject to penalties provided by this chapter.
   (D)   If the person to whom the notice is directed contends that the vehicle
is operable and not discarded, he or she or a designee should take it to the
Police Department for inspection. If this is done within 72 hours of the time
of the giving of the notice, this shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence
that the vehicle in question is not a discarded on nonoperable vehicle.

P.M. Friday and before Noon on the following Monday, the time shall be extended

quarantine the animal for ten days with the place of confinement to be in the
discretion of the Animal Control Officer. During the quarantine period, the
animal is to be securely confined and kept from contact with any other animal
or person.
      (1)   During the quarantine period, the owner must provide a current
rabies vaccination certificate for his or her animal that is being quarantined.
If proof of vaccination cannot be supplied, the animal will be vaccinated by a
veterinarian at the owner's expense before release.

implanted in it prior to its release from quarantine. Such determination shall
be in the discretion of the Animal Control Officer. The animal shall be
registered for its life with the Police Department. The cost of the implant
shall be at the owner's expense before release.

determined by the Animal Control Officer, a microchip may be implanted in it
within 30 days following the animal's release from quarantine. Such
determination shall be in the discretion of the Animal Control Officer. The
animal shall be registered for its life with the Police Department. The cost of
the implant and registry shall be at the owner's expense.
      (4)   The microchip used for these quarantine provisions shall be
numbered. This number will provide entry into a data base that contains the
animal's bite history. The microchip shall be contained in a sterilized
implanting device and shall be individually packaged.
      (5)   The microchip and its corresponding registration history shall be
considered prima facie evidence for any future dangerous animal determination
in accordance with §
91.033 (Dangerous Animals).
   (B)   No person other than an Animal Control Officer or veterinarian shall
kill or cause to be killed any animal suspected of being rabid except in cases

should fall on a weekend or holiday, the bond must be posted by the close of
business on the last regular business day prior to the weekend or holiday. The
bond must be renewed every 30 days thereafter until the court having
jurisdiction adjudicates the matter. Failure to repost bond at the end of any
30-day period will be considered voluntary relinquishment of the animal(s).
Upon conviction of the accused, the court at its discretion may order any
remaining bond money and/or the animal(s) forfeited to Winchester Animal
Control.
         (e)   In the event of the acquittal or final discharge, without
conviction of the accused, the court shall direct the delivery of the animal(s)
and any bond posted, less any reasonable medical, housing, and administrative
costs.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Board of Commissioners of Randolph County does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 93-10, passed 11-3-93; Am. Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-21-24)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood hazard areas of Randolph County are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-21-24)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health.
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains.
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
area.
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas.
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained.
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain.
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible.
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 93-10, passed 11-3-93; Am. Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-21-24)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage.
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-21-24)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.20 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have in common
usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

existing structures and facilities such as painting; re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A FEMA form that is routinely reviewed and approved
by the White House Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork
Reduction Act, that is encouraged to be used to collect certified elevation

   FILL. For floodplain management purposes, any material deposited or placed
which has the effect of raising the level of the ground surface above the
natural grade elevation. Fill material includes but is not limited to
consolidated material such as concrete and brick and unconsolidated material
such as soil, sand, gravel, and stone.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING. 
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   FLOOD OR FLOODING also includes the collapse or subsidence of land
along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or
undermining caused by waves or current of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels that result in a flood as defined above.
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood (see SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source (see FLOODPLAIN).
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see FLOOD).
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. The term describes such state or local regulations in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulative increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE OR FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. Includes only
docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities,
but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. Randolph
County requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or directly
by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. Analyses performed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of Indiana, in accordance with
standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency
floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood
profiles.
   INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL-EVALUATION SERVICE (ICC-ES) REPORT. A document
that presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from a particular
evaluation. ICC-ES reports provide information about what code requirements or
acceptance criteria were used to evaluate a product, and how the product should
be identified and installed.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, result in modification of the
SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
      (2)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). A
letter from FEMA stating that a proposed structure that will be elevated by
fill would not be inundated by the base flood.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a building or area of land
is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
      (4)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT OUT AS SHOWN (LOMA-OAS). An official
determination by FEMA that states the property or building is correctly shown
outside the SFHA as shown on an effective NFIP map. Therefore, the mandatory
flood insurance requirement does not apply. An out- as-shown determination does
not require elevations.
      (5)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (6)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification
of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the
existing regulatory floodway.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. For floodplain management purposes, the lowest elevation
described among the following:
      (1)   The lowest floor of a building.
      (2)   The basement floor.
      (3)   The garage floor if the garage is connected to the building.
      (4)   The first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
      (5)   The floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to
the flow of floodwaters. Designs for meeting the flood opening requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   At least two openings are designed and maintained for the entry
and exit of floodwater; and these openings provide a total net area of at least
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all
such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher. Doorways
and windows do not qualify as openings.
      (6)   The first floor of a building elevated on pilings or columns in a
coastal high hazard area (as that term is defined in 44 CFR 59.1), as long as
it meets the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATURAL GRADE. For floodplain management purposes, the elevation of the
undisturbed natural surface of the ground. Fill placed prior to the date of the
initial identification of the flood hazard on a FEMA map is also considered
natural grade.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, any structure for
which the START OF CONSTRUCTION commenced on or after the effective date of
floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a
vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or corrections to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PREFABRICATED BUILDING. A building that is manufactured and constructed
using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are
transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.
   PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least 51% of the actual cash value of the
structure, less land value, is above ground.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;

temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.22. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY. Any facility involved in the storage or
disposal of non-liquid, non-soluble materials ranging from municipal garbage to
industrial wastes that contain complex and sometimes hazardous substances.
Solid waste also includes sewage sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition
wastes, mining wastes, and liquids and gases stored in containers.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA) OR AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD OR
FLOODPLAIN. Those lands within the jurisdiction of Randolph County subject to a
1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas
are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, or VE. The SFHA
includes areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to best available flood layer
maps provided by or approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement; the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, which is principally above ground. Includes a manufactured home, as well
as a prefabricated building. It also includes recreational vehicles installed
on a site for more than 180 consecutive days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements which have been identified

      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
151.20.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (F)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
151.60(A),
151.60(C)(1) and
151.60(D) of this chapter may be granted.

floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
   (H)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
151.60 through
151.64 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
   (J)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use.
   (K)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance

this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (M)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (N)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request.
(Ord. 2024-16, passed 10-21-24)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.60 FLOODPLAIN STATUS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Floodways (riverine). Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.22, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. Under the provisions of the
Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1) a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing, and paving undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure. General licenses and exemptions
to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-28-1 and 312 IAC 10) may
apply to qualified additions/improvements to existing lawful residential
structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland restoration, utility line
crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and prospecting.
      (1)   If the site is in a regulatory floodway as established in §
151.22, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for approval for construction in a
floodway, provided the activity does not qualify for a general license or
exemption (I.C. 14-28-1 or 312 IAC 10).
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
approval has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant that the
development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license or
exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. The floodplain
development permit shall meet the provisions contained in this chapter.
      (3)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site/
project. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (4)   In floodway areas identified on the FIRM, development shall cause
no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge
without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision and meeting
requirements of §
151.44(A). A conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for
development that would cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure
and such development should not be permitted.
      (5)   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies but not yet identified on the
effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity
of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation
of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined
by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (6)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) Randolph County shall submit the data and request that the Federal
