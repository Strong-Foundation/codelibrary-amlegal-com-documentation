entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to

§ 34.003 PURPOSE OF THE HANDBOOK.

unless superseded by applicable federal, state, or local laws or regulations.
   (B)   We urge you to read this handbook, understanding that the policies and
practices it sets forth are important guidelines and rules for your employment.
It is not a contract. No one is authorized to represent otherwise. The Town of

totally or partially from the policies, practices, and procedures contained in

   (C)   Any employee benefit plan or program provisions described herein are

Employees should refer to those documents for specifics.
   (D)   The guidelines in this handbook will be helpful in familiarizing you
with the town. However, this handbook cannot anticipate every situation or
answer every question regarding employment.

EMPLOYMENT
§ 34.020 EMPLOYMENT AT-WILL.

specific, fixed term of employment are employed on an at-will basis for an

relationship.
(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)

§ 34.022 STATUS OF EMPLOYMENT.

pay, extra regular duty pay, on-call pay, or shift premium pay unless approved

§ 34.023 ACCOMMODATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES.
   (A)   In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and
other applicable state and local laws, we provide reasonable accommodations for
qualified individuals with disabilities. It is our policy to:
      (1)   Ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities are treated in
a nondiscriminatory manner in all terms, conditions, and privileges of
employment, as required by the ADA; and
      (2)   Provide qualified applicants and employees with disabilities with
reasonable accommodations, except where such accommodations would create an

(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.024 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
   (A)   At the time of employment, criminal background checks are obtained
upon the extension of a conditional offer of employment. An employee’s first
day of work must not be prior to the satisfactory completion of a background
check. Conviction of a crime does not automatically eliminate an applicant from
consideration for employment. A decision is reached only after the nature,
severity, and date of offense are thoroughly evaluated.
   (B)   If an applicant attempts to withhold or falsify information pertaining
to his or her criminal background history, he or she will be disqualified from
further employment consideration. If an employee is discovered to have withheld
or falsified information pertaining to his or her criminal background history,
he or she will be subject to further disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.025 PERSONNEL FILES.

(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.026 ANTI-NEPOTISM POLICY.
   (A)   Individuals who are relatives may not be employed in a unit in a
position that results in one relative being in the direct line supervision of
the other relative. Certain employees may not be promoted to a position that
results in one relative being in direct line supervision of the other relative
who is a newly elected official of the town.
   (B)   The town, through any of its boards, commissions, or purchasing
agents, may not enter into a contract or renew a contract for public works or
procurement of goods and services with a relative or a business entity that is
wholly or partially owned by a relative of the executive of the town or member
of the legislative or fiscal body of the town unless certain requirements are
met.

§ 34.027 CONSENSUAL ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS.
   (A)   The Town of Sellersburg strongly discourages romantic or sexual
relationships between a manager or other supervisory employee and his or her
staff because such relationships tend to create compromising conflicts of
interest or the appearance of such conflicts. In addition, such a relationship
may give rise to the perception by others that there is favoritism or bias in
employment decisions affecting the staff employee. If there is such a
relationship, the parties need to be aware that one or both may be moved to
another department, or other actions may be taken.
   (B)   If any employee of the town enters into a consensual relationship that
is romantic or sexual in nature with a member of his/her staff, or if one of
the parties is in a supervisory capacity within the same department in which
the other party works, the parties must notify the administrative department
head and/or a member of the Town Council. Because of potential issues regarding
quid pro quo harassment, the town has made reporting mandatory. This policy
also applies to romantic relationships between other employees, regardless of
reporting structure.
   (C)   Once the relationship is made known to the town, the situation will be
reviewed by the administrative department head to determine the course of
action in the best interests of the town. Both parties may have to sign a
consensual relationship agreement.

   (A)   The Town of Sellersburg recognizes the right of its employees to use

employment, to discuss the potential impact on their duties with the town.
   (B)   Outside employment will not be considered as an excuse for poor job
performance, absenteeism, tardiness, or refusal to work overtime. Should

employment. During the first calendar year of employment, employees earn 1.5
days per month. Thereafter, employees will receive PTO on January 1 of each
year. PTO credited on January 1 will be based on the employee’s years of
service as of December 31 the previous year. PTO is earned on the following
schedule:
 
Length of Service*           Accrual Rate
Less than 2 years of service 1.5 days per month of full-time service (maximum
                             of 15 days)

*Length of service year to begin January 1 of the year following your
anniversary.
 
   (C)   Use and scheduling of PTO. You must schedule PTO at least two weeks in
advance or as soon as possible in the case of illness or emergency. All time
away from work, including unexcused absences, will be deducted from your PTO
bank. Exceptions to this policy are holidays and time off in accordance with
the town’s policy for jury duty, military duty, or bereavement. PTO may be used
in half-day increments. You are required to use your PTO when out on an
approved leave of absence.

      (1)   At the end of each year, employees will receive the option to roll

unused time (refer to division (E) below). There is a 30-day maximum an
employee can roll over into the sick bank. Sick bank leave must be approved by
the administrative department head.
      (2)   The sick bank exists to help employees offset lost income while on
an approved leave of absence for the employee’s own illness or to care for a
dependent who is ill. It may not be used for any other purpose. PTO does not
need to be exhausted prior to using “sick bank” for approved leave of absence
under this section.
   (E)   Cash out option. Employees can cash out earned PTO days. Employees
selecting the cash out option will receive full payment for accrued but unused
PTO of that year, up to their maximum earned days at the time of PTO cash out.
   (F)   Payment upon separation. Upon resignation or separation of employment,
employees will be paid for all PTO earned but not used. Earned PTO is
calculated by multiplying the number of full calendar months the employee
worked in the current year by the number of PTO days he or she is eligible.
That number is divided by 12. Please see the following example:
 
Employee   Years of Service Full Months Eligible PTO Number of Days Paid
                            Completed                Out

the employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating
in school or other daily activities.
      (3)   Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement
includes an incapacity of more than three consecutive full calendar days and
two visits to a healthcare provider or one visit to a healthcare provider and a
continuing regimen of care; an incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal
visits, a chronic condition, or permanent or long-term conditions; or absences
due to multiple treatments. Other situations may meet the definition of
continuing treatment.
      (4)   The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in any 12-month
period-for all reasons combined is 12 weeks, with one exception. For leave to
care for a covered service member, the maximum combined leave entitlement is 26
weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than 12 of those
26 weeks.
   (D)   Identifying the 12-month period. The town measures the 12-month period
in which leave is taken by the “rolling” 12-month method, measured backward
from the date of any FMLA leave with one exception. For leave to care for a
covered service member, the town calculates the 12-month period beginning on
the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered
service member and ends 12 months after that date. FMLA leave for the birth or
placement of a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within 12
months of the birth or placement.
   (E)   Intermittent or reduced schedule leave. You may request leave for the
serious health condition for yourself, spouse, or child on an intermittent or
reduced schedule. Under certain circumstances, the town may temporarily
transfer you to an alternate position for which you are qualified that provides
a solution to your accommodation request. Your pay at the time of the temporary
transfer will not be affected during this time.
   (F)   Employee notice requirements.
      (1)   Employees must provide 30 days’ notice of the need to take FMLA
leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days’ notice is not possible, the
employee must provide notice as soon as practicable. Employees must comply with
normal call-in procedures.
      (2)   Employees must provide sufficient information to determine if the
leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration
of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee is unable to
perform job functions; the family member is unable to perform daily activities;
the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider;
or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave. Employees also
must inform their supervisor if the requested leave is for a reason for which
FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. When an employee seeks leave due
to a FMLA qualifying reason for which the town has previously provided the
employee FMLA protected leave, the employee must specifically reference either
the qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave.
   (G)   Certifications.
      (1)   The Town of Sellersburg requires that an employee’s request for
leave due to a serious health condition affecting the employee or a covered
family member be supported by a certification from a health care provider. The
town may require second or third medical opinions at the expense of the town
and periodic recertification of a serious health condition. The Town of
Sellersburg may utilize a health care provider, a human resource professional,
a leave administrator, or a management official—but not the employee’s direct
supervisor—to authenticate or clarify a medical certification of a serious
health condition.
      (2)   The Town of Sellersburg requires employees returning from leave for
their own serious health condition to submit a certification that they can
resume work. If reasonable safety concerns exist, the company may, under
certain circumstances, require such a certification for employees returning
from intermittent FMLA leave.
   (H)   Compensation and benefits while on family and medical leave.
      (1)   Family medical leave is unpaid leave. In accordance with applicable
state law, employees may be required to apply all accrued and unused paid leave
to all leaves covered by this policy.
      (2)   The Town of Sellersburg will continue to pay its portion of the
group health premium for the duration of any approved FMLA leave. The employee
continues to be responsible for paying his or her group health insurance
premiums as if he were still actively working during this period. Premiums must
be submitted monthly. Failure to submit payment within 30 days may result in
termination of coverage for the duration of the leave. An employee’s failure to
pay his or her portion of the group health insurance premium will result in
coverage being canceled. If an employee does not wish to continue group health
insurance while on family and medical leave, the town should be notified
immediately.
      (3)   Employees who can return to work within the FMLA approved leave
time limits will be entitled to be covered by health insurance at the time they
return to work if their coverage has lapsed for any reason during the approved
FMLA leave. Any changes to company health coverage while an employee is on a
family and medical leave will be applied as if the employee were still actively
employed.
      (4)   Paid time off benefits will cease to accrue while an employee is on
FMLA.
   (I)   Return from leave.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided by law, upon returning from FMLA leave
eligible employees will be restored to their original job or to an equivalent
job with equivalent pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment.
Restoration may not be possible if, for example, your position has been
eliminated. Additionally, certain key employees may not be entitled to job
restoration under certain conditions. If you are a key employee, you will be
notified of such status. Use of FMLA leave will not affect the calculation of
an employee’s seniority or years of service. If an employee has taken leave due
their own medical condition, a clearance to return to work is required from the
certifying physician.
      (2)   For additional information about your rights and responsibilities
under FMLA and/or to request leave under this policy please contact your
supervisor.
      (3)   The Town of Sellersburg recognizes that certain states may have
laws which provide greater or diverse types of leave and/or may require less
advance notice than that set forth above. In such event, the applicable state
family and medical leave law shall apply.

required to pay their portion of insurance premiums. You may pre-pay in advance
or send in monthly payments to the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. The payment must
be received by the 15th day of the month. If any payment is more than 30 days
late, the town will terminate your coverage. If a check is returned for
insufficient funds, the town will not consider the payment made until the town
receives sufficient cash, a money order, or a cashier’s check.
   (E)   Return to work. Employees that are on a personal leave of absence due
to medical reasons will need to provide a release to work from your physician.

WORKPLACE EXPECTATIONS
§ 34.100 ATTENDANCE.
   (A)    Being at work on time every day is important. Your co-workers and the
town’s residents depend on you. The Town of Sellersburg realizes that
occasional absences are unavoidable. However, excessive absenteeism or
tardiness creates a hardship for your co-workers. Because of this, frequent and
unapproved absences and excessive tardiness can be cause for disciplinary
action or dismissal.
   (B)   Attendance policy guidelines.
      (1)   In the event you are unable to come to work, it is critical that
you provide as much notice as possible to ensure coverage for your position.
The further in advance you provide notice, the more likely that coverage will
be possible.
      (2)   Employees must call their department head at least 60 minutes
before the start of your scheduled work time to report an absence or extended
time away from the office. It is your responsibility to contact your department
head, leave a message and then call another department head on duty. This
procedure must occur every day you are absent unless you are on an approved
leave of absence.
      (3)   In the event an employee is going to be late for work, the employee
is required to notify their department head at least 30 minutes prior to start
of their scheduled work time. Any instances of arriving late to work, taking
extended breaks, or leaving work early must be reported to your supervisor and
will be recorded in attendance records. Employees that need to leave work early
for any reason must notify their department head before leaving.
      (4)   A no-call, no-show will be cause for disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment. If you have three unreported consecutive
absences, the town will consider it to be job abandonment and will assume that
you have voluntarily resigned from your employment.
      (5)   If you are absent for three or more consecutive workdays, we may
require you to provide medical documentation to support your absence. The town
reserves the right to address the issue of chronic absenteeism or tardiness by
accelerating the disciplinary process, up to and including termination.

disclosure and discussion of this information to only those employees who need
to know. Employees should never use this information for personal benefit or
for the benefit of others.
(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.102 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (A)    Employees have a responsibility to avoid any situation that might
make it difficult to act in the best interest of the Town of Sellersburg. A
conflict of interest may exist when you or a member of your family has a
financial interest in a company that has a contract or other dealings with the
town. In addition, receiving personal gains from a business relationship, a
conflict of interest likely exists. For clarity on whether any transaction or
vendor relationship may be a violation of this policy, you should contact your
department head.
   (B)   In addition, employees, including elected officials, must not accept
honorariums, compensation, or gifts in exchange for their services as a town
employee. This policy does not prohibit the acceptance of small items of
nominal value. However, prior to accepting any gifts, gratuities, favors,
preferential treatment, event tickets or anything else of monetary value (more
than $25) from companies or individuals related to the job, you must receive
approval from the administrative department head. To the extent state law
requires an alternative handling of honorariums, compensation, or gifts, the
town will comply with those laws.
(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.103 SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION.
   (A)    People who are not employed by the Town of Sellersburg may not
solicit or distribute literature and goods on town property for any purpose at
any time. Vendors soliciting in the normal course of business who have
established a business relationship with the town are excluded from this
restriction. Exceptions to this policy are at the discretion of the Town
Council.
   (B)   The town strives to communicate clearly and accurately with its
employees; therefore, unless the town is involved in the activity, all notices,
brochures, and other forms of solicitation of or by outsiders are prohibited.
Employees are discouraged from soliciting other employees during working time.

your clothing and appearance is clean and contributes to a professional
atmosphere for co-workers, clients, residents, and visitors.

will be unpaid. Repeated violations of this policy may result in disciplinary
action.

always be observed:

conduct themselves accordingly;

§ 34.105 DRUG AND ALCOHOL-FREE WORKPLACE.
    The Town of Sellersburg prohibits employees from unlawfully manufacturing,
distributing, dispensing, selling, transferring, using, or possessing any
illegal controlled substance or alcohol on town premises while working. Any
employee found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. The town reserves the
right to require applicants and employees to consent to a drug and alcohol
test. No testing will be performed without an applicant’s or employee’s written
consent.
   (B)   Pre-employment testing. The town requires applicants for employment to
submit to a drug screen prior to starting work. The drug test is a pre-
employment, post-offer requirement. Candidates found to have a positive drug
screening will be subject to additional medical review and, based on the
findings, may not be considered for employment.
   (C)   Post-accident testing. In the event of a workplace accident or injury,
the town may determine that it is necessary to conduct a post-accident drug and
or alcohol screening. The employee’s supervisor will accompany the employee to
the designated testing site. Refusal to submit to the test or a positive result
on such a test, is grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.

or alcohol test when there is reason to believe that you are under the
influence of drugs and/or alcohol, while at work. Refusal to submit to such
testing, or a positive result on such a test, is grounds for disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
(Ord. 2021-OR-031, passed 11-22-21)
§ 34.106 NON-HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   We are committed to providing all employees the opportunity to work in
an environment free of illegal harassment. The town strives to provide all
staff, clients, and vendors with an environment free of harassment. This can
exist only when each employee is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect and
one in which each is judged solely on criteria relating to job performance.
   (B)   The town expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employment
harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity or expression, genetic information, national origin, age, disability,
status as Vietnam-era or special disabled veteran, or status in any group
protected by state or local law. The town has adopted the following guidelines
to deal with any form of harassment that may occur during business hours or on
town premises, or in any location where the employee is conducting work.
   (C)   (1)   Sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Physical assaults or physical conduct that is sexual in nature;
         (b)   Unwelcome sexual advances or comments or requests for sex or
sexual activities concerning one’s employment or advancement, regardless of
whether they are accompanied by promises or threats;
         (c)   Sexual displays or publications such as calendars, cartoons, or
graffiti;
         (d)   Other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which has
the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual’s work performance, or
creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and
         (e)   Retaliation for complaints of harassment.
      (2)   The town regards all such conduct as creating a hostile and
offensive work environment in violation of this policy, regardless of whether
submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of employment. Examples of sexual harassment include sexual
propositions, sexual innuendo, sexually suggestive comments, sexually-oriented
“kidding,” “teasing,” or “practical jokes,” jokes about gender-specific traits,
foul or obscene language or gestures, displays of foul or obscene printed or
visual material, and physical contact, such as patting, pinching, or brushing
against another’s body; or reading or otherwise publicizing in the work
environment, materials that are sexually suggestive or revealing.
   (D)   (1)   Racial, religious, or national origin harassment includes: any
verbal, written, or physical act in which race, religion, or national origin is
used or implied in a manner which would make a reasonable employee
uncomfortable in the work environment or which would interfere with the
employee’s ability to perform the job.
      (2)   Examples of race, religious or national origin harassment include:
         (a)   Jokes which include reference to race, religion, or national
origin;
         (b)   The display or use of objects or pictures which, adversely
reflect on a person’s race, religion, or national origin; and
         (c)   The use of language which is offensive due to a person’s race,
religion, or national origin.
   (E)   If you have been a victim of sexual harassment or any other form of
illegal harassment or if you witness the illegal harassment of others, you
shall immediately report your concerns to a supervisor or the Town Manager. If
this is not an option because your supervisor or Town Manager is the harasser,
you should contact a member of the Town Council. Each complaint will be treated
in a confidential manner, subject to our legal obligation to investigate and
respond appropriately to such complaints. Retaliation against anyone involved
in reporting an incident of harassment is strictly prohibited. Conversely, we
consider filing knowingly false reports of harassment a violation of this
policy.
   (F)   Retaliation. The town’s policy prohibits retaliation against any
employee by another employee or by the town itself for using this complaint
procedure or for filing, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner
in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by a federal, or state
enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation includes, but is not limited to,
demotion, suspension, failure to make employment recommendations impartially,
adversely affecting working conditions, or otherwise denying any employment
benefit.

§ 34.107 EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   As a part of their performance management responsibilities, the town’s
management personnel are accountable for informing employees of performance
and/or behavior which is in need of improvement. The purpose for such
counseling is to create a mutual understanding of performance and conduct
expectations, to develop and improve performance or conduct which is not
meeting expectations, and to delineate consequences for those, employees who do
not achieve minimum acceptable standards for performance or conduct.
   (B)   The Town of Sellersburg utilizes a progressive discipline policy.
Outlined below are the steps of the town’s progressive discipline policy and
procedure. The Town of Sellersburg reserves the right to combine or skip steps
depending on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense.
      (1)   Step One: counseling and documented warning. The first step creates
and opportunity for the employee’s immediate supervisor to schedule a meeting
with the employee and bring any existing performance, conduct or attendance
issue to their attention. The supervisor will discuss the nature of the problem
or violation of the town’s policies and/or procedures. The supervisor is
expected to clearly describe expectations and steps the employee must take to
improve performance or resolve the problem. This meeting will be documented and
signed by both the employee and supervisor.
      (2)   Step Two A: final written warning.
         (a)   Although the town hopes that the employee will promptly correct
any performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identified in Step One,
the town recognizes that this may not always occur. The Step Two written
warning involves more formal documentation of the performance, conduct or
attendance issues and consequences.
         (b)   During Step Two, the immediate supervisor will meet with the
employee to review any additional incidents or information about the
performance, conduct or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant
corrective action plans. Management will outline the consequences for the
employee of his or her continued failure to meet performance or conduct
expectations.
         (c)   A formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring the
employee’s immediate and sustained corrective action will be issued. The PIP
will include a statement warning the employee that failure to meet and maintain
the expectations of the plan will result in further disciplinary action, up to
and including termination.
      (3)   Step Two B: suspension.
         (a)   There may be performance, conduct or safety incidents so
problematic and harmful that the most effective action may be the temporary
removal of the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessary
to ensure the safety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisor may
suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation.
         (b)   Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal
progression of this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject to
approval from a next-level manager and HR.
         (c)   Depending on the seriousness of the infraction, the employee may
be suspended without pay in full day increments consistent with federal, state
and local wage-and-hour employment laws. Nonexempt/hourly employees may not
substitute or use an accrued paid vacation or sick day in lieu of the unpaid
suspension. Due to Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) compliance issues, unpaid
suspension of salaried/exempt employees is reserved for serious workplace
safety or conduct issues. HR will provide guidance so that the discipline is
administered without jeopardizing the FLSA exemption status.
         (d)   Pay may be restored to the employee if an investigation of the
incident or infraction absolves the employee.
      (4)   Step Three: recommendation for termination of employment.
         (a)   The last and most crucial step in the progressive discipline
procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, the town will
try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing
warnings, a final written warning or suspension from the workplace before
proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However, the Town of

§ 34.108 PROBLEM SOLVING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The town encourages employees to address and discuss any work-related
problems with their immediate supervisor. Every reasonable effort should be
made by both the employee and the supervisor to resolve work related problems.
If a resolution is not reached, the employee may use the town’s problem-solving
procedure.
   (B)   This procedure has been established as a guide for resolution to work
related problems. If the problem continues to exist after undertaking the
actions below, the formal problem-solving procedure is invoked. While a
complaint/concern is being resolved, employees will have the obligation to
continue to work and not engage in work stoppages, slowdowns or other such
actions. The system is designed to function without interrupting or downgrading
the quality or delivery of patient care services. Supervisory staff is
responsible for ensuring that the problem is fully processed until the employee
is either satisfied with the answer or has exhausted the problem-solving
procedure.
   (C)   Formal problem-solving procedure.
      (1)   After discussing the problem or concern with their direct
supervisor, an employee is expected to document their grievance and submit it
in writing to the next person in the chain of command. If the employee is not
satisfied with the next response, they must continue up the chain of command.
The Town of Sellersburg chain of command is as follows:
         (a)   Supervisor;
         (b)   Department head;
         (c)   Town Manager/Police Chief;
         (d)   Town Council.
      (2)   Management will not in any way discriminate or retaliate against an
employee who exercises procedures of this policy. Furthermore, management will
not discriminate or retaliate against an employee who assists in the
investigation or presentation of complaints or concerns filed according to this
policy.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 35.60 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Fixed Asset Policy is being issued effective May 1, 2005. The new
policy will be referred to as the Capital Asset Policy. This policy is being
issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on our
financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. The issuance of a
policy document is related to the implementation of a new reporting model,
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 34. Statement 34 will require
the town to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset threshold will be
$5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will be expensed in the year
purchased. The infrastructure portion of this policy is also effective May 1,
2005.
   (B)   Town Water Utility will follow this same definition of capital assets
except any item with a unit cost of $500 or more shall be capitalized. Assets
that are not capitalized (items less than $500) are expensed in the year of
acquisition. Town Utilities will follow the capitalization guidelines of the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
   (C)   The town has established a capital asset policy in order to provide a
higher degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets,
and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies:
citizens, rate-payers, oversight bodies and regulators.
   (D)   The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold:
      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens, to fix responsibility
for the custody of equipment;
      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
      (3)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition,
maintenance and retirement policies;
      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting;
      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public
assets.
   (E)   This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including
fixed and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through the
Indiana State Board of Accounts. It does not include data processing,
programming requirements, or computer operations procedures.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.61 DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets include: land, land improvements, including monuments,
buildings, building improvements, construction in progress, machinery and
equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. All land will be capitalized but not
depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one year, having a unit
cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by lease-
purchase agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the criteria
will be reported and depreciated in the government wide financial statements.
   (B)   Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000) are expensed
in the year of acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers and
other equipment with a capitalized cost of less than $5,000. (See §
35.67)
Exceptions are:
      (1)   Items costing less than the above limits which are permanently
installed as a part of the cost of original construction or installation of a
larger building or equipment unit will be included in the cost of the larger
unit;
      (2)   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets though the cost of individual items is less than such units;
      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added subsequent
to original construction, which are custom made for a specific place and
adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.
NOTE: Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements or
the above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
   (C)   Threshold levels for capital assets. The following schedule will be
followed for the different types of capital assets other than infrastructure
assets:
      Capitalized/Depreciate
   Land               All/Capitalize only
   Land Improvements         $5,000.00
   Building            $5,000.00
   Building Improvements      $5,000.00
   Construction in Progress      All/Capitalize only
   Machinery and Equipment      $5,000.00
   Vehicle            $5,000.00
   Utility Assets            $5,000.00
   (D)   Infrastructure.
      (1)   At the network level, the asset will be classified as major if the
cost of the network item is at least 10% of the cost of all capital assets in
fiscal year 1999. A network will be defined as a group of similar assets that
serve a particular function or purpose for the town.
      (2)   At the subsystem level, the asset will be classified as major if
the cost of the subsystem item is at least 5% of the cost of all capital assets
in fiscal year 1999. A subsystem will be defined as a segment of a network of
assets that serve a similar function for the town.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.62 VALUATION OF CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Capital assets must be recorded at actual cost. Normally the cost
recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but also
included is any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and intended use. Such costs could include the
following:
      (1)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;
      (2)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
      (3)   Damage payments;
      (4)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
      (5)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
      (6)   Insurance premiums during construction;
      (7)   Transportation charges;
      (8)   Interest costs during construction.
   (B)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market
value on the date donated.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.63 ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset
category be precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records
maintenance be fully aware of the categorization system. This section further
clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
   (A)   Land. Land is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage
including rights-of-way and easements, owned by the town, its various
departments, boards or authorities, regardless of the method or date of
acquisition. Easements will not be included as the town does not own them, but
as an interest in land owned by another (i.e. property owner) that entitles its
holder to a specified limited use.
   (B)   Improvements other than buildings.
      (1)   Examples of town assets in this category are walks, parking areas
and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters, underground
sprinkler systems, and other similar items.
      (2)   Examples of town utilities assets in this category are water supply
mains, collection sewers, wells, dams, fences, intake pipes, manholes, and fire
hydrants.
   (C)   Buildings.
      (1)   All structures designed and erected to house equipment services, or
functions are included. This includes systems, services, and fixtures within
the buildings, and attachments such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies,
areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, and all other such units that serve the
building.
      (2)   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilating
and air handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems, surveillance systems,
passenger and freight elevators, escalators, built-in-casework, walk-in coolers
and freezers, fixed shelving, and other fixed equipment are included with
building, if owned. Communication antennas and/or towers are not included as
buildings. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
   (D)   Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property
within the scope of the fixed asset management system not previously
classified. Included within this category are office mechanical equipment,
office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items, maintenance
equipment, communication equipment, police, fire, sanitation and park
department, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency
equipment, earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment, and
data processing equipment. All supplies are excluded.
   (E)   Infrastructure.
      (1)   Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally
can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital
assets and that are normally stationary in nature. Examples include road,
streetlights, traffic signals, drainage systems and water systems.
Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any
other examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the
property above.
      (2)   Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the
capacity or efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs
will be considered as necessary to maintain the existing asset, and therefore
not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing, snow removal, etc., are
considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also, normal department
operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary engineering
and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of the
infrastructure asset.
      (3)   Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the
following reason: Existing improved alleys will be maintained as gravel alleys,
and the town is responsible only for the maintenance, such as patching and
repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys will be done by homeowner
participation. Therefore, the town will not track and value alleys and the
patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
      (4)   The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of GASB
34 requires the town to report items put into service from 1980 forward, and
gives the town the option to report items put into service prior to 1980. The
town will report only on items put into service after 1980. Retroactive
reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2007
which the town will comply with.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.64 DEPRECIATION METHODS.
   The town will be depreciating capital assets by using either composite/group
method depreciation or the straight-line method. Salvage value will be
determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-
end. Land is not depreciated according to general accepted accounting
principles.
   (A)   Composite/group network.
      (1)   Composite depreciation refers to calculating depreciation for a
collection of similar assets. A single composite rate is applied annually to
the acquisition cost of the collection as a whole. At year-end an adjustment
will be made to the total cost to account for any additions/disposals
throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it will also
be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when using the
composite method. A full year's depreciation will be taken when the asset is
placed in service and no depreciation recorded in the year it is sold or
disposed of. To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for the composite
group, divide 1 by the number of years the assets are depreciated. For
instance, a group of assets with a 25-year life will be depreciated at 4% each
year (1/25).
      (2)   Following is the list of groups that will be used for depreciation:
      Composite/Group Depreciation
         (a)   Street lights — 35 years
         (b)   Traffic signals — 25 years
         (c)   Flood walls/gates — 50 years
         (d)   Roads
            1.   Cement — 10 years
            2.   Gravel — 15 years
            3.   Concrete — 30
            4.   Asphaltic Concrete — 20 years
            5.   Brick or Stone — 50 years
   (B)   Straight-line depreciation.
      (1)   All assets accounted for under the capital asset policy will be
depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation. A gain or loss on
disposal will be recorded. Following is a list of the most common useful lives:
         (a)   Vehicles — 5 years
         (b)   Office equipment — 5 years
         (c)   Office furniture — 20 years
         (d)   Heavy equipment — 10 years
         (e)   Fire trucks — 15 years
         (f)   Buildings — 50 years
         (g)   Building components (HVAC systems, roofing) — 20 years
         (h)   Leasehold improvements — useful life of asset or lease term
(whichever is shorter)
         (i)   Land improvements — structure (parking lots, athletic courts,
swimming pools) — 20 years
         (j)   Land improvements — ground work (golf course, athletic fields,
landscaping, fencing) — 20 years
         (k)   Outdoor equipment — (playground equipment, radio towers) — 15
years
         (l)   Grounds equipment — (mowers, tractors, attachments) — 15 years
         (m)   Computer hardware — 3 years
         (n)   Computer software — 5 years
      (2)   Town Utilities' useful lives are as follows:

end of the lease term;
      (2)   The lease contains a bargain purchase option;
      (3)   The lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of
the leased property;
      (4)   The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease, excluding executor costs, equals at least 90% of the fair value of
the leased property.
   (C)   Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria should be recorded
as an operating lease and reported in the notes of the financial statements.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.66 ASSET TRANSFERS AND DISPOSITIONS.
   (A)   Property should not be transferred, turned-in for auction, or disposed
of without prior approval of the department head. A vehicle/equipment out
processing checklist should be sent to the Clerk-Treasurer's office in all
cases. This form is a dual-purpose form for transfer (defined as any movement
of an asset by virtue of change in location, either by account, department,
building, floor, or room) or retirement (disposal) of property.
   (B)   The main points to be remembered when using this form are:
      (1)   Always provide sufficient detail to properly identify the asset,
most importantly the asset's tag number or town ID;
      (2)   Be accurate and do not overlook any of the needed entries;
      (3)   Write legibly;
      (4)   Complete each column for every asset listed on the form;
      (5)   Enter information in correct row, depending on whether you are

(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.67 PERIODIC INVENTORIES.
   A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item over $5,000) will be
conducted in each department on or about December 31 of every year. The Clerk-
Treasurer's office will conduct spot checks on a random basis. Department heads
will be accountable for the capital asset inventory charged to their
departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year end.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.68 RESPONSIBILITIES OF CLERK-TREASURER'S OFFICE.
   The Fiscal Officer will ensure the accounting for capital assets is being
exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and
periodically in subsequent years. The Fiscal Officer will further ensure that
the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect additions,
retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance
for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation
calculation.
(Ord. 2005-014, passed 5-9-05)
§ 35.69 RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEPARTMENT MANAGERS.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the department head to act as or designate

focal point for questions regarding the availability, condition, and usage of
the asset, as well as the contact during the physical inventory process.
   (B)   The department head or his or her designee, who shall be identified in
writing and forwarded to each Town Council member, shall be designated to
record the receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to make sure that no
damage was incurred during shipment and to make sure that the asset was
received in working order.
   (C)   The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary
preventative maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working
condition. It is necessary to have a responsible person available for questions
that arise during a physical inventory or when someone wants to borrow the
asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for which it
was acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition,
the steward should report, in writing, to his or her department head, any
property damage or theft.
   (D)   Department heads shall be accountable for an inventory list for all
inventory above $500 charged to their departments and shall verify a list of
their capital assets at year end.
   (E)   Department heads shall use the form set forth in Exhibit A for their
inventory list.

      (1)   Materiality, in the town, is hereby defined as $500 per occurrence.
That is, if one occurrence of a loss or shortage or other irregularity is equal
or greater than $500, it must be reported to the SBOA.
      (2)   This materiality definition is not limited to defalcations or
suspicious activity involving only cash or cash transactions. If supplies,
equipment or other fixed assets belonging to the town of Sellersburg are
suspected of being misappropriated or stolen or used in a manner not authorized
by town officials and the value of those supplies, equipment or fixed assets
are approximately $500, that misuse or series of misuse should be reported.
That is not to say that if a loss or shortage is less than $500 it should be
ignored. If there is a series of events, within the same office or department
that appears to be a structuring event to defraud or misappropriate the town of
Sellersburg funds or property, that event or series of events should be
reported to the SBOA.
   (C)   Material variances, losses shortages or thefts. All erroneous or
irregular material variances, losses, shortages, or thefts of political
subdivision funds or property shall be reported immediately to the SBOA. For
all material variances, losses, shortages or thefts, the SBOA shall:

appropriate government and law enforcement officials;
      (2)   Determine the internal control weakness that contributed to or
caused the condition; and
      (3)   Make written recommendations to the appropriate legislative body or
appropriate official overseeing the internal control system addressing:
         (a)   The method of correcting the condition; and
         (b)   The necessary internal control policies and internal control
procedures that must be modified to prevent a recurrence of the condition.
   (D)   Notification of fiscal misconduct. If any town employee knows or has a
concern that other town employees are engaged in fiscal misconduct, it is his/
her duty to immediately notify their supervisor or at least two members of the
Town Council, or if the supervisor or a Town Council member is involved, then

Customer type              Water  Sewer
Residential–Rental       $50.00 $50.00
Residential–Owner-occupie$50.00 $50.00
 
 
Customer type               Water Sewer
                            15% of the previous active 12 month's
                            charges, including taxes, (rounded to the
                            nearest $100) at the service address for
                            each service. If the service is new at the
Commercial, Institutional,  address, the 12 month's charges will be
Industrial and Governmental estimated based upon the type and size of
                            the customer as compared to similar types
                            and sizes of customers. Deposits are
                            subject to periodic review, after which,
                            the deposit may be adjusted to more
                            accurately reflect the 15% requirement.
 
   (C)   Residential–general.
      (1)   When a previously terminated account (owner-occupied or renter)
returns to establish a new account after a period of time has elapsed, the
deposit on those accounts which have previously established a negative credit
history (see division (F) for "History Defined") with Sellersburg Utilities,
may be double the regular deposit as in division (B) and any amounts previously
written off as bad debts must be paid and collection or legal fees paid to
outside agencies must be reimbursed before a new account will be established.
      (2)   If an active account (owner-occupied or rental) continually becomes
or remains past due (determined by multiple application and penalty charges
against the account), or service has been disconnected due to non-payment, a
deposit equal to double the schedule established in division (B) may be
required for continuation or reestablishment of service.
   (D)   Residential–rental.
      (1)   A residential rental deposit shall always be required before
utility service will be rendered.
      (2)   When a rental account moves to a new account, a new Application for
Water/Sewer Service shall be required. The old deposit normally shall be
transferred to the new account. If, however, the customer has developed a
history of being past due (see division (F) "History Defined"), the old deposit
shall stay with the old account and a new deposit shall be required for the new
account. In this event, the deposit required on the new account may be double
the regular deposit requirement. The old deposit will be applied to the current
and final bills of the old account, and the balance, if any, will be refunded.
If the old account is past due on the moving date, a new account will not be
established until the old account is brought current. If, after the final bill
is prepared, the old deposit is not sufficient to cover the remaining charges
on the old account and the old account becomes past due, the new account will
be subject to service termination as though the two accounts were one.
      (3)   If the new account has different services from the old account, the
new account's deposit requirements must be attained. A reduction in the
requirement may result in a partial refund of the deposit.
      (4)   When planning a move, the Utility Business Office should be given
sufficient notice so that services can be terminated on the planned date of
vacating the premises.
   (E)   Non-residential–general.
      (1)   Commercial, industrial, governmental, and institutional accounts
shall be required to put down a deposit before utility service(s) will be
rendered.
      (2)   If an account continually becomes or remains past due (determined
by multiple application of penalty charges against the account), a deposit
equal to double the schedule established in division (B) may be required for
continuation of services.
      (3)   If an account is disconnected because of non-payment, the deposit
shall be used to pay all existing charges. Upon re-establishing, the required
deposit balance shall be required in order to increase the amount covered, the
payment of reconnect charges, and the payment of any charges not covered by the
deposit before services will be restored.
   (F)   History defined. Having a "history of being past due" or a "negative
credit history" is hereby defined as follows:
      (1)   Having been past due on more than one occurrence during the
preceding 12-month period;
      (2)   Having any service disconnected as a result of non-payment during
the preceding 24-month period; and/or
      (3)   Being past due on the date service is terminated. This includes
those customers who request service be terminated at one location and connected
at a new location as a result of moving to said new location.
   (G)   Refunding of deposits and the payment of interest.
      (1)   Cash deposits will be applied to the customer's final bill after
which the balance, if any, will be refunded. Any balance due after application
of the deposit shall be due and payable on or before the date specified on the
final bill.
      (2)   If a given utility has a deposit balance remaining after the
utilities charges are satisfied, said balance shall be applied to other utility
charges not so satisfied before any amount of the deposit is refunded.
      (3)   Interest will not be paid on any part of the deposit.
   (H)   Availability of forms. Copies of this policy and related forms will be
available at the Utility Business Office.
   (I)   Bank accounts.
      (1)   Deposits are to be maintained in one bank account maintained on
behalf of the town.
      (2)   When an individual no longer uses the town water, sewer, or
sanitation services, a refund of the deposit can be made from this one bank
account less any current charges owed to the town.
      (3)   The State Board of Accounts has no objection to the maintenance of
one bank account wherein deposits for water and sewer service will be
maintained together until refunded or otherwise disposed of as allowed by law.

or any combination thereof on any parcel shall be fined not more than $1,000
per day and not less than $250 per day for the violation. In addition, this
person may be required to remove fill dirt, fill material, or construction or
demolition materials or any combination thereof, which has been placed or
dumped without the approval of the Town Building Commissioner or the Town Board
of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   In the event the town shall be required to pursue legal action to
prevent or stop dumping of fill dirt, fill material or construction or
demolition materials or any combination thereof, if the person is found to be
in violation of this section, said individual will be required to pay the
town's legal costs and fees associated with the enforcement of this section.
      (2)   If the Town Building Commissioner, or the Town Board of Zoning
Appeals grants the authority to the person for the placement of more than six
cubic yards of dirt or place any construction or demolition materials or any
combination thereof on any parcel within the municipal limits of the town, the
person who dumps said fill dirt or placed any construction or demolition
materials or any combination thereof on any parcel shall state the time period
in which said fill dirt or construction or demolition materials or any
combination thereof will be allowed to be dumped, and the exact content of all
fill material. In no event shall a person be authorized to dump fill material
within the municipal limits of the town for a period of more than three months
without obtaining an extension from the Town Building Commissioner. If the Town
Building Commissioner refuses to grant the extension of time, the person shall
be entitled to appeal their decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The
decision of the Town Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final.
   (H)   Anyone having knowledge of any dumping at any location throughout the
town shall give such information to a law enforcement officer or the Town
Building Commissioner who shall investigate the site, along with the assistance
of such other town officials that are deemed necessary to determine from what
source said fill material or fill dirt has originated, the manner of dumping,
and whether the owner or person in possession of the property on which the fill
dirt or till material is located is aware and consented to said dumping.
   (I)   Upon determining the identity landowner listed on the property record
maintained by the Clark County Auditor, the Town Building Commissioner shall
issue a written order in person or by certified mail, directed the owner of
said real property on which the dumping has occurred, to remove and cleanup
said fill dirt, fill material or any construction or demolition materials or
any combination thereof within the time period of no less than 30 days. Failure
to comply with this order shall require the Town Building Commissioner to
initiate the cleanup and removal of said materials as required and all costs
and expenses associated with the removal and cleanup of said materials,
including but not limited to all land fill fees of an approved landfill site,
and all town law enforcement officials' time incurred in the enforcement of
this section, shall be chargeable to the person, individual, corporation,
organization, partnership or entity identified with said dumping location.
   (J)   Any person identified as having violated the prohibited dumping
provisions of this section and who are owners of real property within the
municipal limits of the town shall have the cost of said cleanup of the area
billed to said property owner. If the property owner fails to pay the charges
associated with the cleanup within 60 days from the date of mailing, then said
costs shall be assessed and certified to the Clark County Auditor and
Treasurer, said costs and assessment shall be placed on the tax role of such
property owner as an additional assessment for "dumping clean up" and shall be
payable by such property owner in the same manner and subject to the same
penalties as real property taxes. In the alternative, the Town Attorney shall
be entitled to seek injunctive or other relief through the courts of Clark
County, and obtain orders requiring individuals, corporations, partnerships,
organizations, including non-profit organizations to clean up the dumping area
and prohibiting further and future dumping in violation of this section.
   (K)   In the event that the area of fliedumped materials is owned by more
than one corporation, individual, or entity or there is information identifying
more than one individual, person, corporation, or entity for the cleanup of the
whole dumpsite, all actions authorized under this section shall be taken
against any and all such violators regardless if other such individuals are
located.
   (L)   A fee of $250 shall be collected by the Town Building Commission for
the issuance of a location improvement permit as required by this section.

§ 53.025 QUANTITY OF WATER DISCHARGED AND ITS EFFECT.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in a manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and the
sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates, except as is
hereinafter provided in this section.
   (B)   The town may make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for
quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed, but which are also
shown to the satisfaction of the town that the quantities do not enter the
sanitary sewerage system.
      (1)   (a)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town.
         (b)   In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this
subchapter, the owner or other interested party, shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for
determining sewage discharge.
      (2)   (a)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids in the
town's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of
water supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a
user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is
measured by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used
shall be otherwise measured or determined by the town.
         (b)   In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other
interested parties shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
      (3)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate
or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the
town's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
each case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged
for each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
      (4)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.
      (5)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are
users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter,
then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out
elsewhere herein. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or
any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.

   (A)   (1)   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of
providing service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only
on the volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger than normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
      (2)   The town shall require the user to determine the strength and
content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly,
into the sanitary sewage system, in a manner and by a method as the town may
deem practicable in order to determine the proper charge.
   (B)   The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the town
at all times.
   (C)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess
of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or ammonia nitrogen in excess of 30
milligrams per liter of fluid.
   (D)   (1)   Additional charges for treating stronger- than-normal domestic
waste shall be made on the following basis:
         (a)   There shall be an additional charge of $0.19 per pound of sewage
or waste containing suspended solids in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of
fluid.

the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
the billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by the tenant or tenants, provided that the examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that the
office is open for business.
   (D)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which the rates or charges
shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the bill.

of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the town, or by a firm of
certified pubic accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms
shall have experience in the studies, or by the combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the town shall
determine to be best under the circumstances. The town shall, upon completion
of the study, revise and adjust rates and charges, as necessary in accordance
therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the

of and interest on revenue bonds which, by their terms, are payable from the
net revenues of the sewage works and the payment of any fiscal agency charges
in connection with the payment of bonds, which fund shall be designated the
“Sewage Works Sinking Fund” or "Sinking Fund.”
      (2)   There shall be set aside and deposited in the Sinking Fund, as
available, and as hereinafter provided, a sufficient amount of the net revenues
of the sewage works to meet the requirements of the Bond and Interest Account
and Reserve Account Created in the Sinking Fund. The payment shall continue
until the balances in the Bond and Interest Account and the Reserve Account
equal the principal of and interest on all of the then outstanding bonds of the
sewage works to their final maturity.
   (B)   (1)   Any monies heretofore accumulated to pay principal and interest
on the refunded bonds shall be credited to and become a part of the Trust
Account under the escrow agreement and shall be applied on the first payments
made from the Trust Account. Beginning as of the date of issuance of the
refunding bonds, there shall be credited on the last day of each calendar month
from the Revenue Fund to the Bond and Interest Account an amount of the net
revenues equal to at least one-twelfth of the principal of and at least one-
sixth of the interest on all then outstanding bonds payable on the ten next
succeeding principal and interest payment dates until the amount of interest
and principal payable on the ten next succeeding respective interest and
principal payment dates shall have been so credited.

on the refunding bonds; or
         (c)   Ten percent of the proceeds of the refunding bonds, plus a minor
portion thereof as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as existing on
the date of issuance of the refunding bonds, which shall be the reserve
requirement.
      (3)   If the initial deposit into the Reserve Account does not equal the
reserve requirement or if no deposit is made, an amount of net revenues shall
be credited to the Reserve Account on the last day of each calendar month until
the balance therein equals the reserve requirement. The monthly deposits shall
be equal in amount and sufficient to accumulate the reserve requirement within
five years of the date of delivery of the refunding bonds.
      (4)   The Reserve Account shall constitute the margin for safety and
protection against default in the payment of principal of and interest on the
refunding bonds, and the monies in the Reserve Account shall be used to pay
current principal and interest on the refunding bonds to the extent that monies
in the Bond and Interest Account are insufficient for that purpose. Any
deficiency in the balance maintained in the Reserve Account shall be made up
from the next available net revenues remaining after credits into the Bond and
Interest Account.
      (5)   Any monies in the Reserve Account in excess of the reserve
requirement shall either be transferred to the Sewage Works Improvement Fund or
be used for the purchase of outstanding bonds or installments of principal of
fully registered refunding bonds.

here as those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a
six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same
pollutant parameter by any amount;
         (b)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, FOG and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
         (c)   Any other discharge violation that the Wastewater Utility
Superintendent believes has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public;
      (2)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Wastewater Utility
Superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent the
discharge;
      (3)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, complying with
construction requirements or attaining final compliance;
      (4)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports
and reports on compliance schedules;
      (5)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (6)   Any other violation(s) which the Wastewater Utility Superintendent
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
(`93 Code, § 9-204) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 54.090 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Wastewater Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may serve upon that user a
written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Wastewater Utility Superintendent. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the Wastewater Utility Superintendent to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without issuing a
notice of violation.
(`93 Code, § 9-206) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.091 AGREED ORDERS.
   The town may enter into agreed orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. The documents will include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. The documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
54.093 and
54.094 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(`93 Code, § 9-207) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.092 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   (A)   (1)   The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Utility Superintendent and show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
      (2)   The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior
to the hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user.
   (B)   A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(`93 Code, § 9-208) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.093 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Wastewater Utility Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated.
   (B)   Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(`93 Code, § 9-209) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.094 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Wastewater Utility Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Wastewater Utility Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all violations.
   (B)   The Superintendent may direct the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take the appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (C)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(`93 Code, § 9-210) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.095 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   (1)   When the Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may fine the user in an
amount not to exceed $25,000, as provided by the Federal Clean Water Act, 33
USC 1365.
      (2)   The fine shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis.
      (3)   In the case of violations of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
   (C)   (1)   Users desiring to dispute the fines must file a written request
for the Wastewater Utility Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with
full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine.
      (2)   Where a request has a merit, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent
may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(`93 Code, § 9-211) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.096 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after formal notice to the user, whenever the suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to, present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons.
      (2)   The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may also immediately suspend
a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Wastewater
Utility Superintendent may take steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Wastewater
Utility Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Utility
Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in §
54.097 are initiated against the user.
   (C)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contributions and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Utility Superintendent prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§
54.092 and
54.097.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(`93 Code, § 9-212) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.097 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
54.047, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards herein.
   (B)   (1)   The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
54.092 why the proposed action should not be taken.
      (2)   Exercise of this option by the Wastewater Utility Superintendent
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
(`93 Code, § 9-213) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.098 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Wastewater Utility Superintendent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may petition the County
Circuit Court through the Town Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement
imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Wastewater Utility
Superintendent may also seek other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(`93 Code, § 9-216) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.099 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (A)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the town for a
maximum civil penalty of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
violation of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   (B)   The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may recover reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the town.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(`93 Code, § 9-217) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.100 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   (A)   (1)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The
Wastewater Utility Superintendent may take any, all or a combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the town's enforcement response plan.
      (2)   However, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
   (B)   Further, the Wastewater Utility Superintendent is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(`93 Code, § 9-218) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.101 UPSET.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operating in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Wastewater
Utility Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance;
   (D)   (1)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (2)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(`93 Code, § 9-222) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.102 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in §
54.005(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
54.005(B)(3).
   (B)   A user must prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass through or interference, and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each
limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
(`93 Code, § 9-223) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.103 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Wastewater Utility Superintendent at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater Utility
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass.
      (3)   The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater Utility Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
      (3)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of this
section.
   (E)   The Wastewater Utility Superintendent may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Wastewater Utility
Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
division (D) above.
(`93 Code, § 9-224) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
RATES AND CHARGES
§ 54.115 PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.
   (A)   The Council may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the town's pretreatment program.
   (B)   These fees may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing the applications;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;

by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties
chargeable by the town.
(`93 Code, § 9-228) (Ord. 1994-601, passed 9-26-94)
§ 54.116 SURCHARGE AND FEE SCHEDULE.
   (A)   If the characteristics of the wastewater of any user as determined by
the town shall be such as to impose a burden upon the POTW, then an additional
charge or surcharge as determined by the Council shall be charged the user
responsible before such wastewater may be discharged into the system. This
surcharge fee shall be collected on the basis of estimating the surchargeable
amount with each monthly billing.
   (B)   The surcharges to be charged for the treatment of extra strength
sewage shall be determined by the following table.
   (C)   The surcharge shall come into effect should the concentration of BOD5,
TSS and ammonia as nitrogen exceed the concentrations listed in the first
column. The surcharge shall be charged for each gallon or pound of the
particular pollutant in excess of these concentrations.
 
Pollutant           Maximum Concentration Surcharge
BOD5                < 200 mg/l            $0.23/gallon over 200 mg/l
TSS                 < 250 mg/l            $0.19/pound over 250 mg/l

provisions of the chapter and its associated technical standards document with
regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to a project. However, any
initial determination of such applicability shall not be binding on future
determinations of the town that may be based on the review of more detailed
information and plans.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.003 BACKGROUND.
   (A)   On December 8, 1999, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was published in the Federal
Register. The NPDES program, as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean
Water Act, controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Phase II of NPDES requires permit
coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s) and for small construction activity that results in
the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre. This federal regulation
went into effect March 10, 2003. In response to Phase II of NPDES, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management enacted MS4GP and revised CSGP.
   (B)   Under these state and federal regulations, the Town of Sellersburg is
required to establish a regulatory mechanism for regulating stormwater quality
management. The town had created ordinances to meet these regulations.
Therefore, this document was created to update and consolidate these current
ordinances into one comprehensive Drainage Ordinance and accompanying
Stormwater Technical Standards.

§ 55.004 FINDINGS.
   The Town of Sellersburg finds that:
   (A)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and
downstream of the town are at times subjected to flooding;
   (B)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
   (C)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds,
resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
   (D)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
   (E)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects
within the town will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely
affect the town's water bodies and water resources;
   (F)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the town will,
absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the
town's water bodies and water resources;
   (G)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation
of stormwater management;
   (H)   Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and
referenced in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the
deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; and
   (I)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources, and for
compliance with state and federal regulations.

§ 55.030 SPILL REPORTING.
   (A)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a waterbody any
substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately
inform the Town of Sellersburg concerning the discharge. A written report
concerning the discharge shall be filed with the town and IDEM, by the
dischargers, within five days. The written report shall specify:
      (1)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
      (2)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
      (3)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
      (4)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional
information on the matter.
   (B)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.031 INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING.
   (A)   Storm drainage system. The Town of Sellersburg has the authority to
periodically inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the town's
control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and
discharges into the system. This inspection will include a screening of
discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if
prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could
also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system
itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other
than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff.
   (B)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the town may
inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of
the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the town's properly
identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all
hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The town or
its properly identified representative may place on the discharger's property
the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified
illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as
described in §§
55.095 et seq.
   (C)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion of
construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the town, the town has the
authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to verify that
all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system
are in compliance with this section.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT
§ 55.040 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The storage and controlled release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be
required for all new business, institutional developments, commercial and
industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned development, rural
estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located
within the Town of Sellersburg. The town, after thorough investigation and
evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor
subdivisions and parcelization.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.041 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the town do
not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting
from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled release of
excess stormwater runoff as well as compensation for loss of floodplain storage
shall be required for all developments and redevelopments (as defined in
Appendix A) located within the town. Release rate requirements, downstream
restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property impact
considerations, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.042 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual are consistent with the policy stated above.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.043 PLACEMENT OF UTILITIES.
   No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without
the consent of the town staff, whose decision may be appealed to the Town
Council of Sellersburg. All existing drainage facilities shall have senior
rights and damage to said facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in
§§
55.095 et seq.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.044 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to insure full compliance with the
provisions of this section, the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, design
and construction standards, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.
   (B)   The town also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quantity
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage
capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater
quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with
the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, in
addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures, and shall not
be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except as approved by the town. If
deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be
notified by the town and will be required to take all necessary measures to
correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies
within the allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the
town will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if
necessary.
   (C)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more
than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved. Stormwater
detention/retention basins may be donated to the town or other unit of
government designated by the town, for ownership and permanent maintenance
provided that the town or other governmental unit is willing to accept
responsibility in writing.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION    FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES
§ 55.055 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The Town of Sellersburg will require a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and
materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of a project’s
construction plans and specifications. Any project located within the corporate
boundaries of the Town of Sellersburg that includes clearing, grading,
excavation or other land disturbing activities resulting in the disturbance of
10,000 square feet or more of total land area is subject to the requirements of
this subchapter. This includes both new development and re-development. This
subchapter also applies to disturbances of land that are part of a larger
common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately
disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total land area. Section
55.057 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of the Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP)
shall also be in compliance with the Construction Stormwater General Permit
(CSGP).
   (B)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities.
   (C)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; and
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the town, and ensure that a
sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed
and submitted in accordance with §§
55.080 et seq. regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger
permitted project site.
   (E)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than 10,000 square feet,
located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the
larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with
the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger
project site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site
must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual
lots.
   (F)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§
55.080 et seq. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to
ensure compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the town with a
sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site. However, all persons engaging in construction and
land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this section
and this chapter.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.056 POLICY ON STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent
on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original position
(erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody
(sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. For land disturbance
of one acre or more, the developer must submit to the town a SWPPP with
detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a narrative describing
materials handling and storage, and construction sequencing. For land
disturbances totaling 10,000 square feet or more but less than one acre,
appropriate erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the
Town of Sellersburg technical standards must be designed and shown on the
plans. The following principles apply to all land-disturbing activities and
shall be considered in the preparation of a SWPPP within the corporate
boundaries of the Town of Sellersburg.
   (A)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a development
that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fills in areas
with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within 35 feet of top of bank) to
watercourses and lakes also should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Un-
vegetated or vegetated areas with less than 70% cover that are scheduled or
likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or
permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season to reduce
erosion potential. Alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable
if the project site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have
implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to
prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area.
   (C)   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so
that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest
practical period of time during development.
   (D)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to
reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and
adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities
will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet. Methods for
determining acceptable velocities are included in the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual.
   (E)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project site
shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to
minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access shall be provided at
all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site.
   (F)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or unused
building materials, including garbage, debris, packaging material, fuels and
petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
concrete truck washout, and other substances from being carried from a project
site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete truck washout is
permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and
unused building materials shall be managed and disposed of in accordance with
all applicable state statutes and regulations. Proper storage and handling of
materials such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup
measures shall be implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to
contaminate surface or ground water or degrade soil quality.
   (G)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated
sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated
sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall
be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all
applicable statutes and regulations.
   (H)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either discharged
directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or diffused and
released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or pollutant problem
to the adjacent property owner.
   (I)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff.

§ 55.057 CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance for the purposes of
determining applicability of this subchapter to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
      (1)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
      (2)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must
comply with this chapter unless the total combined disturbance on all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
      (3)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
subchapter, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the
total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:
         (a)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the
expected lot disturbance.
         (b)   For a single-family residential project site where the lots are
less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being
disturbed.
         (c)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications
outlined in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the Town of Sellersburg
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in
these two references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the
requirements of CSGP. A copy of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be
obtained through IDEM.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.058 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   Following approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to conduct
inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this
section, the approved stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.
   (B)   A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the project site
owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A qualified professional, registered with the town per Ord. 2004-
OR-026 shall perform a written evaluation of the project site by the end of the
next business day following each measurable storm event. If there are no
measurable storm events within a given week, the site should be monitored at
least once in that week. Weekly inspections by the qualified professional shall
continue until the entire site has been stabilized and a notice of termination
has been issued.
   (C)   The qualified professional should look at the maintenance of existing
stormwater pollution prevention measures, including erosion and sediment
control measures, drainage structures, and construction materials storage/
containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning properly. The qualified
professional should also identify additional measures, beyond those originally
identified in the stormwater pollution prevention plan, necessary to remain in
compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations.
   (D)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name of the
qualified professional performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation,
problems identified at the project site, and details of maintenance, additional
measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed.
   (E)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the qualified professional for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
   (F)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to the
town, the town has the right to request complete records of maintenance and
monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution prevention measures. All
evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to the town, in

STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT  FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
§ 55.070 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §§
55.055 et seq., the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be
submitted to the town as part of the stormwater management permit application,
must also include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures
are incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in
place following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
corporate boundaries of the Town of Sellersburg that includes clearing,
grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the
disturbance of 10,000 square feet or more of total land area, is subject to the
requirements of this section. This includes both new development and re-
development, and disturbances of land less than 10,000 square feet of total
land area that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the
larger common plan will ultimately disturb 10,000 square feet or more of total
land area. In addition, regardless of the amount of disturbance, the Town of
Sellersburg reserves the right to require pre-treatment best management
practices (BMPs) for proposed hot spot developments in accordance to provisions
contained in the Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   (B)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
      (1)   Agricultural land disturbing activities;
      (2)   Forest harvesting activities;
      (3)   Construction activities associated with a single family residential
dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale; or
      (4)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted project.
   (C)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
      (1)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10;
      (2)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34; and
      (3)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant
to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under
329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the
expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or
outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a
stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is
completed and submitted to the town in accordance with §§ 55.080 et seq. It
will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure proper
construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to
notify the town with a sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion
of the project and stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property
owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements
must comply with the requirements of this section and this chapter.

§ 55.071 POLICY ON STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
Town of Sellersburg, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants
from stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate BMPs, stormwater runoff will be filtered, and
harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed.
   (B)   The project site owner must submit to the town a SWPPP that shows
placement of appropriate BMPs from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the
Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The SWPPP submittal
shall include an Operation and Maintenance (O and M) Manual for all post-
construction BMPs included in the project and a notarized maintenance
agreement, consistent with the sample agreement provided in Appendix D of the
Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, providing for the
long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of which shall be recorded with the
deed for the property on which the project is located. The noted BMPs must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized.
However, the burden of proof as to whether the performance and ease of
maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines provided in the
Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual would be placed with
the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration
of acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the Town of Sellersburg Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.

   (B)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of
all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design
criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Town of Sellersburg
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in
the referenced standards is in keeping with the above stated policy and meet
the requirements of IDEM’s Rule 13.

§ 55.073 INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING, AND REPORTING.
   (A)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the town and
the commencement of construction activities, the town has the authority to
conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter, the approved SWPPP, the Town of Sellersburg
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the
approved permit.
   (B)   Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition in
accordance with the operation and maintenance procedures and schedules listed
in the Town of Sellersburg Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, in addition
to the designed and approved performance specifications for the facilities, and
shall not be subsequently altered, revised, or replaced except as approved by
the town.
   (C)   The town also has the authority to perform long-term, post-
construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater quality
facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available water
quality storage capacity and the operational condition of key facility
elements. Noted deficiencies and recommended corrective action will be included
in an inspection report.

PERMIT REQUIREMENTS  AND PROCEDURES
§ 55.080 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   This subchapter applies to all development, or re-development of land,
that results in land disturbance of one acre or more. Individual lots with land
disturbance less than one acre shall refer to §§
55.055 et seq. and §§
55.070 et seq. for plan review requirements and procedures. Figure 1 is a
flowchart summarizing the plan review/permit approval process and can be found
at the end of this subchapter.
   (B)   All projects located within the corporate boundaries of the Town of
Sellersburg lie within the town's MS4 area boundary by default. The project
site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater management permit to
the town. The application will include construction plan sheets, a stormwater
drainage technical report, a SWPPP, and any other necessary support
information. Specific information to be included in the application can be
found in §
55.081 below. Four copies of each application must be submitted to the town.
The town may, at its discretion, require one or more copies be submitted to the
Clark County Surveyor, or other entity deemed appropriate by the town.
Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format
accepted by the town.
   (C)   After the town’s receipt of the application, the applicant will be
notified as to whether their application was complete or insufficient. The
applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. If the application is complete, it will be reviewed in detail by
the town and/or its plan review consultant(s). Once the review has been
completed, the Town Planning and Zoning Director or their designee will either
approve the project, request modifications, or deny the project.
   (D)   The project site owner must notify the town and IDEM 48 hours before
beginning construction. Notification shall be in the form of an updated IDEM
NOI form. Once a permit has been issued and the updated NOI submitted to the
town and IDEM 48 hours before the beginning of construction, construction may
commence. Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor
construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention
measures in compliance with this chapter and the terms and conditions of the
approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities, as-built plans
must be submitted to the town. A notice of termination (NOT) shall be sent to
the town once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary
erosion and sediment control measures have been removed. The town, or its
representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify that the
requirements for an NOT have been met. Once the applicant receives a “verified"
copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy to IDEM. Permits issued under this
scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is
not completed within five years, the NOI must be resubmitted at least 90 days
prior to expiration.

§ 55.083 REQUIRED ASSURANCES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater
management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the town or retained
privately. As a condition of approval and issuance of the permit, the Town of
Sellersburg shall require the applicant to provide assurance in form of an
irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the stormwater management plan has
been accepted and before construction begins. Said assurance will guarantee a
good faith execution of the stormwater drainage plan, the stormwater pollution
prevention plan, the stormwater quality management plan, and any permit
conditions. The assurance shall be for an amount equal to 110% of the total
costs of all stormwater management measures for the entire project. The above-
mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate as prepared by a registered
engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for the installation and ongoing
monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures and the construction and
ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm drainage infrastructure, detention/
retention facilities, and stormwater quality BMPs, as regulated under this
chapter, until the construction is completed, the site is stabilized, and as-
built plans are accepted by the town. Assurances shall be for a minimum of
$5,000. All other performance bonds, maintenance bonds or other assurances
required by the town in accordance with any and all other ordinances shall also
apply and so be required. Local governmental jurisdictions may require
additional performance and/or maintenance assurances. The intent of this
assurance is not only to complete the installation of storm drain
infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate stormwater
pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained. If
adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
stormwater assurance.

§ 55.095 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in the local zoning ordinances is also necessary.
Compliance with all applicable ordinances of the Town of Sellersburg as well as
with applicable State of Indiana statutes and regulations shall also be
required. Unless otherwise stated, all other specifications referred to in this
chapter shall be the most recent edition available. Violations of the
requirements of this chapter are subject to the penalties listed in this
subchapter.
   (A)   Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of
this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design plan
or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this
subchapter. Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and
may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of
the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the town finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the town may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this division shall limit the authority of the
town to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
(Ord. 2021-OR-003, passed 1-11-21; Am. Ord. 2024-OR-022, passed 12-16-24)
§ 55.096 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER.

   (D)   Stop work order.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the town may order the work stopped by
notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or causing of such
work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until
authorized by the town to proceed with the work. A stop work order will be
posted on the site by the town and it is unlawful for any person to remove the
notice or continue any work on the site without permission from the town.
      (2)   The town may also undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent violations of this
chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance herewith. The cost
of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the work is being done and the responsibility of any person
carrying out or participating in the work.
      (3)   Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work order
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
less than $1,000, and such person shall also pay such costs as may be imposed
in the discretion of the court. A permit reinstatement fee may also be assessed
by the town.
   (E)   Withhold certificate of occupancy. The town may refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or
being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person
has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter as determined by the town.
   (F)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits. The town may
suspend, revoke, or modify any existing permit that the violator may also have
been previously granted. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be
reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured
the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon
such conditions as the Town of Sellersburg may deem necessary to enable the
applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures
to cure such violations.
   (G)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the town finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the town may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance requirements and take
such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this division shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the town may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater drainage system or
waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
         (c)   The town may allow the person to recommence its discharge when
it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town
within five days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
      (2)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the town may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (3)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system access. The violator
may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an
offense if the person reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises

the permit any time, at the sole discretion of the Police Department, if it is
determined that the golf cart no longer meets the requirements of this chapter.
If the permit holder disagrees with the revocation, he or she may petition this
Council in writing for review of the decision at the next regularly scheduled

side two feet wider than the trench opening. The pavement and base material
shall be replaced according to the specifications set forth by the Town
Engineer. All seams must be cleaned and tack-coated to provide a seamless joint
to the surrounding pavement. No cold patch shall be used except for temporary
patching which will be maintained by the contractor for the duration until HMA
pavement can be installed.
   (E)   Concrete paving. Concrete pavement shall be neatly saw cut and the
whole disturbed panel shall be removed and replaced. There will need to be at
least two feet of undisturbed soil on each side of the excavation to allow the
concrete patch to bridge the excavation. The new concrete patch shall be
installed using Class A concrete. The finish is to match the existing finish of
the surrounding pavement. All concrete patches shall be treated with a curing
compound.
   (F)   Ditches. Ditches disturbed by excavating shall be properly graded,
seeded and blanketed to allow for positive drainage. The blanket needs to be
approved by the Town Engineer.
   (G)   Grass. Grass areas that are disturbed shall have a minimum of six
inches of aggregate free soil installed and seeded (equal to or better than

the application is required to schedule a final inspection with the Town
Engineer. If all work and stabilization is completed to the sole satisfaction
of the inspector and stabilization has been maintained for no less than 21
days, the inspector shall sign off on the release of the permit. The release of
the permit does release the contractor from the settling and germination
requirements of 70% germination.

if unusual conditions exist which may dictate higher than usual damages.
   (K)   Responsibility of work. The town shall hold the applicant directly
responsible for all work performed under the permit.
   (L)   Notification. The Town Engineer's office shall be notified a minimum
of four hours prior to starting all pavement repairs so that an inspector may
observe the placement of the new patch material. Failure to notify the Town
Engineer shall result in removal and replacement of such material with
applicant responsible for the costs. Hours for this inspection shall occur
during regular business hours.
   (M)   Liability. The application shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless,
the town, its employees, agents, and representatives against any and all
claims, demands, judgements, losses and expenses, related, directly or
indirectly, or which may arise from any injury to person or persons and damage
to property resulting or caused from or by the work or from any condition
created by such work in the street, public place, or ROW by the applicant.

INSTALLATION OF SPEED HUMPS/BUMPS IN NEIGHBORHOODS
§ 94.35 STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The use of speed bumps and speed humps to control speeding on
neighborhood streets is documented within many jurisdictions across the county.
Prior to the Council considering whether or not to install the speed bumps or
speed humps on a local road within the town, the applicant must satisfy certain
requirements more specifically set forth below.
   (B)   The applicant must:
      (1)   Complete and return a petition to Public Works Director or Town
Manager or their designee, identifying the requested location(s) of the speed
humps or speed bumps to be installed;
      (2)   Provide a detailed list of all property owners and corresponding
mailing addresses for where the county tax bills are forwarded for each
property owner, which may be found in the office of the Clark County Auditor
for every residence within the respective neighborhood if the neighborhood has
less than 150 homes. If a neighborhood has more than 150 homes, then the
applicant shall provide the names and addresses of every residence owner on the
street of where the speed bump or speed hump shall be installed as well as the
names and addresses of the people on each adjacent street (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Speed Bump/Hump Controlled Area");
      (3)   Notice each property owner on the list by first class mail with a
copy of the petition and the date of the public hearing, which shall be
established by Public Works Director or Town Manager or their designee. The
applicant must also show proof of said noticing.
   (C)   The public hearing referred to in division (A)(3) shall only be
conducted if the applicant provides documented proof that at least 70% of
residence within the Speed Bump/Hump Controlled Area supports the installation
of the speed bump or speed hump. This may be accomplished by a signed petition.
   (D)   The Council shall, upon hearing the petition at a public meeting,
determine whether to install the speed hump or speed bump and the decision will
be reduced to writing and provided to the applicant. The Council shall take the
following information, and any other information that may be relevant, into
consideration when deciding whether or not to install the speed hump or bump:
      (1)   The town's budget for said year;
      (2)   The Town Engineer's recommendation;
      (3)   Total cost; and
      (4)   Priorities of the town.
   (E)   The applicant is responsible for paying for 50% of the total costs of
the installation of the speed bump or speed humps. However, if town funds are
unavailable the applicant may pay for 100% if it chooses to do so.
   (F)   After the hearing, should the Council decide that a speed bump or
speed hump is warranted in the Speed Bump/Hump Controlled Area, then the
Council shall cause to have a quote prepared for the installation and the
applicant will have 60 days to deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer 50% of the
quote. Once the 50% is deposited, the Public Works Director, Town Manager or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council of the Town of Sellersburg does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30.)
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human
habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns,
and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
the Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;

preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.

provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.

   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new

adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision

effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.

         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the

intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
Town of Sellersburg subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
the town are generally identified as such on the Clark County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated April l6, 2014 as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that

Rate Map dated April 16, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review, subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of

§ 152.13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the Town of Sellersburg, the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 of this chapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 of this chapter have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages
or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-007, passed 4-16-14)
§ 152.47 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
152.40 through
152.47.
