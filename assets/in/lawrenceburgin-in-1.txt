   (D)   That the sexual harassment policy statement to be disseminated shall

      (1)   Sexual Harassment Policy. The City of Lawrenceburg strives to
provide a place of work free of sexual harassment, intimidation or
exploitation. It is expected that all city employees covered by this policy
will treat one another with respect.
      (2)   Unwelcome sexual advance, requests for sexual favors, visual
conduct (such as inappropriate brochures, posters, calendars or symbols
displayed in the workplace), physical conduct (such as unwelcome or offensive
touching, or blocking someone's path) and nonverbal conduct (such as whistling,
leering or offensive hand gestures) all constitute harassment when:
         (a)   It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission or
rejection of the conduct will be a factor in employment decisions or
evaluations; or
         (b)   The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating
or hostile work environment.
      (3)   If you feel that you or another employee has been harassed in any
way, notify your manager or supervisor; or your manager or supervisor's
superior. Reports of sexual harassment are taken seriously and will be dealt
with promptly. The specific action taken in any particular case depends on the
nature and gravity of the conduct directly reported and may include
intervention, mediation, investigation, and the initiation of the grievance and
disciplinary process. Where sexual harassment is found to have occurred, the
city will act to stop the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and discipline
and or take appropriate action against those responsible.
      (4)   The City of Lawrenceburg recognizes that confidentiality is
important. Sexual harassment advisers and others responsible to implement this
policy will respect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals reporting or
accused of sexual harassment to the extent reasonably possible.
      (5)   Retaliation and/or reprisals against individuals who, in good
faith, report or provide information in an investigation about behavior that
may violate this policy are against the law and will not be tolerated.
Intentionally making a false report of providing false information, however, is
grounds for discipline.

§ 50.04 NET METERING.
   (A)   The city encourages interested citizens and businesses to invest in
renewable electric generation systems and enter into a net metering arrangement
with the municipal electric utility of the city.
   (B)   Eligible net metering customers include residential, commercial and
industrial customers in good standing that own and operate a solar, wind,
biomass, geothermal, or hydroelectric generating facility that: (1) has a
nameplate capacity less than or equal to 10 kilowatts; (2) is located on the
customer's premises and is operated by the customer; and (3) is used primarily
to offset all or part of the customer's own electric requirements.
   (C)   The Council authorizes the utility to offer net metering to eligible
net metering customers on a first come, first served basis. The utility shall
limit the aggregate amount of net metering facility nameplate capacity from all
eligible net metering customers to 1/10 of 1% of the utility's most recent
summer peak load.
   (D)   The utility shall measure the difference between the amount of energy
delivered by the utility to the eligible net metering customer and the amount
of energy generated by the eligible net metering customer and delivered to the
utility. If the eligible net metering customer generates more energy than it
consumes in a month, the customer shall receive a bill credit from the utility
for the amount of surplus energy generated. The utility shall not purchase or
wheel power produced by an eligible net metering customer's facilities.
   (E)   Net metering tariff terms and conditions.
      (1)   Availability. Net metering is provided upon request and on a first-
come, first-served basis. Net metering is available to single phase customers
in good standing that own and operate a renewable generation source (such as
solar or wind). The name plate rating of customer’s generator must not exceed
10 kW. Customers served under this tariff must also take service from the
utility under the otherwise applicable standard service tariff.
      (2)   Definition. NET METERING means measuring the difference in an
applicable billing period between the amount of electricity supplied by utility
to customer who generates electricity using an eligible renewable generation
source and the amount of electricity generated by such respective customer that
is delivered to utility.
      (3)   Rate.
         Customer charge:   $50 per meter per month.
      (4)   Billing. The measurement of net energy supplied by utility and
delivered to utility shall be calculated in the following manner: utility shall
measure the difference between the amount of electricity delivered by utility
to customer and the amount of electricity generated by the customer and
delivered to utility during the billing period, in accordance with normal
metering practices. If the kWh delivered by utility to the customer exceeds the
kWh delivered by the customer to utility during the billing period, the
customer shall be billed for the kWh difference. If the kWh generated by the
customer and delivered to utility exceeds the kWh supplied by the utility to
customer during the billing period, the customer shall be credited in the next
billing cycle for the kWh difference. When customer elects to discontinue net
metering service, any unused credit will be granted to utility. The utility
shall not purchase or wheel power produced by net metering facilities. Energy
charges will be in accordance with the lowest energy charge in the standard
tariff that would apply if the customer did not participate in net metering
under this tariff and any applicable energy cost adjustment, tracker or other
riders applicable to the standard tariff.
      (5)   Metering. The customer’s standard meter, if capable of measuring
electricity in both directions will be used. If utility determines new metering
is necessary, the utility will install metering capable of net metering at the
customer’s expense. Additionally, the utility reserves the right to install, at
its own expense, a meter to measure the output of the renewable generation
system.
      (6)   Other terms and conditions. In order to be eligible for net
metering, the customer’s generator must meet the following requirements:
         (a)   All kWh must be generated from the output of solar, wind,
biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, or other renewable generation sources;
         (b)   The generation equipment must be operated by the customer and
located on the customer’s premises;
         (c)   The generator must operate in parallel with the utility’s
transmission and distribution facilities without adversely affecting the
utility’s system and equipment and without presenting safety hazards or threats
to the reliability of service to the utility, its personnel and other
customers. The customer is required to sign the interconnection agreement to
safeguard utility employees;
         (d)   The customer’s generation must be intended primarily to offset
all or part of the customer’s requirements for electricity;
         (e)   The name plate rating of customer’s generator must not exceed 10
kW and the customer’s generation must satisfy the Interconnection requirements
specified below.
         (f)   Customer shall submit an application for interconnection service
including a $100 application fee and will execute an interconnection agreement
acceptable to the utility.
         (g)   Customer shall maintain homeowners, commercial or other
insurance providing coverage in the amount of at least $100,000 for the
liability of the insured against loss arising out of the use of generation
equipment associated with net metering under this tariff.
         (h)   The supplying of, and billing for, service and all conditions
applying thereto, are subject to the utility’s general terms and conditions.
   (F)   In accordance with the terms of the net metering tariff terms and
conditions in division (E) of this section, the utility shall enter into an
interconnection agreement with the eligible net metering customer, which
incorporates technical interconnection requirements and requires the customer’s
existing system conform with the requirements before the net metering facility
may be interconnected with the utility’s system.
   (G)   It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to connect or maintain
the connection of a renewable generating facility to the utility’s system
without first executing an interconnection agreement with the utility. Any
person or entity found to be in violation of this section shall be fined not
less than $300, nor more than $1,000 for each such violation, plus costs. In
addition to the foregoing fines and at the utility’s sole discretion, the
property where a renewable generating facility is unlawfully connected to the
utility’s system may be disconnected from the utility’s system until an
interconnection agreement is executed between the owner of such property and
the utility. Every day that a violation of this section occurs shall constitute
a separate offense.

§ 50.05 REMOVAL OF MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY FROM JURISDICTION OF THE INDIANA
UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION.
   (A)   The City Council determines that the public interest requires the city
to remove itself from the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of
approval of rates and charges and the issuance of bonds, notes, or other
evidences of indebtedness with respect to the city electric utility.
   (B)   Pursuant to I.C. 8-1.5-3-9.1, the city hereby removes its electric
utility from the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of approval of
rates and charges and of the issuance of bonds, notes, or other evidences of
indebtedness.

nonpayment of bills, a reconnection charge of $50 must be paid by customer
before such service is reconnected. All other guidelines and rules of service
are contained in a booklet given to every new utility customer at the
commencement of their service, which are incorporated herein.
(Ord. 2-2015, passed 3-2-15)
§ 50.07 PURCHASED POWER COST ADJUSTMENT TRACKING FACTOR.

§ 52.085 GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   Scope and purpose. The purpose of this section is to control
discharges into the public sewerage collection system and POTW that interfere
with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines,
interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls and contribute
waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is
beyond the treatment capability of the POTW.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      FATS, OILS AND GREASES or FOG. Material composed primarily of fats, oils
and greases from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oils and greases
shall be deemed as GREASE by definition. These substances are detectable and
measurable using analytical test procedures established in 40 C.F.R., as may be
amended from time to time. GREASE does not include petroleum base products.
      FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT. Those establishments engaged in activities of
preparing, serving or otherwise making food available for consumption by the
public, including but not limited to, restaurants, commercial kitchens,
churches, clubs, caterers, hotels, schools, hospitals, prisons, correctional
facilities and care institutions. These establishments use one or more of the
following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all
methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods),
boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared
heating, searing, barbecuing and any other food preparation activity that
produces a hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires
washing.
      GREASE INTERCEPTOR. A structure or device designed for the purpose of
removing and preventing fats, oils and greases (non-petroleum grease) from
entering the sanitary sewer system. These devices are below-ground units in
outside areas and are built as two or three chamber baffled tanks.
      GREASE TRAP. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases
(non- petroleum) and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the
grease trap and entering the sanitary sewer system. Such grease traps are
compact under-the-sink units that are near food preparation areas. These
devices also serve to collect settleable solids, generated by and from food
preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the grease trap and entering
the sanitary sewer system. Grease traps in lieu of grease interceptors are not
permitted without written approval of the Joint Building Department.
      INDIANA PLUMBING CODE. References herein to the Indiana Plumbing Code
shall mean 675 IAC 16-1.4-1 et seq., as amended or replaced from time to time.
Application of the Indiana Plumbing Code to the provisions of this section and
the enforcement thereof shall always be the application and interpretation of
the most current version of the code section.
      JOINT BUILDING DEPARTMENT. The Director of Municipal Utilities and the
Building Inspector together constitute the Joint Building Department.
      MAILING. For purposes of mailing documents and receipt thereof, notices
shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery shall
be deemed made on the date signified on the return receipt. Notices may also be
hand delivered with receipt determined on the date of such delivery.
      MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY. The design features of a grease interceptor
and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases
from grease-laden wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer system.
      POTW or PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS. A treatment works which is owned
by a municipality as defined by § 502(4) of the Clean Water Act. This
definition includes any devices and systems used in the storage, treatment,
recycling and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid
nature. It also includes all sewers, pipes and other conveyances that transfer
wastewater to a POTW. The term also means the municipality as defined in§ 502
(4) of the Act, which has jurisdiction over the indirect discharges to and the
discharges from such a treatment works. For purposes of this section, the terms
SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM and POTW may be used interchangeably.
      SAND, SOIL AND OIL INTERCEPTORS. Approved and industry standard system
that is specifically designed and manufactured to separate sand, soil and
petroleum based oil and grease from water. The system shall allow the sand,
soil and oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to prevent it
from being discharged into the wastewater collection system.
      USER. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional
limits of the city, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into sewers within the wastewater service area,
including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as
those who discharge hauled wastewater.
   (C)   General criteria.
      (1)   Installation requirements. All existing, proposed or newly
remodeled food service establishments inside the city's wastewater service area
shall be required to install, at the user's expense, an approved, properly
operated and maintained grease interceptor that complies with the Indiana
Plumbing Code. Each food service establishment must have its own grease
interceptor, unless approved by the Joint Building Department in writing.
      (2)   Maximum and minimum sizes. The maximum size of a grease interceptor
shall be 2,000 gallons. The minimum size of a grease interceptor shall be 1,000
gallons for users without a dishwasher and shall be 1,500 gallons for users
with a dishwasher. If a user requires a grease interceptor with a volume larger
than 2,000 gallons, multiple grease interceptors shall be installed in series
but in no event shall the volume of a single grease interceptor be less than
1,000 gallons (or 1,500 gallons if a dishwasher) or greater than 2,000 gallons.
      (3)   Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories and the like shall not be discharged into the grease interceptor.
These flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
      (4)   Floor drains. Only floor drains that discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
      (5)   Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste
products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a
grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to separate solids interceptor
before connecting to the grease interceptor. Solids interceptor and grease
interceptor shall be sized and rated for the discharge of the food waste
grinder.
      (6)   Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease
interceptor unless discharge water exceeds 140ºF/60ºC. If the discharge
temperature exceeds 140ºF/60ºC, then temperature equalization equipment must be
used before discharge enters the grease interceptor. Dishwashers discharge soap
and hot water that can melt grease and allow it to pass through an undersized
grease interceptor. Therefore, grease interceptors must be sized accordingly to
allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify and
float to the top of the grease interceptor.
      (7)   Location. Grease interceptors shall be installed outside the
building upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will
allow easy access for inspection, cleaning and removal of the intercepted
grease at any time. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part
of a building without written approval by the Joint Building Department.
      (8)   Pass through limits. No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentrations to the sanitary sewer system to exceed 100 mg/l (milligrams per
liter) as identified by EPA test method 1664A, as amended from time to time.
   (D)   Discharge criteria.
      (1)   Where fats and greases are a byproduct of food preparation and/or
cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be made to separate fats and greases into a
separate container for proper disposal. Fats and greases shall not be
discharged to any drains or grease interceptors, except as contained in
byproducts of food preparation and/or clean up. Such waste shall be placed in a
container designed to hold such waste and either utilized by the industry or
disposed of at suitable locations.
      (2)   None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease
interceptor, or into any drain that leads to the interceptor:
         (a)   Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes,
degreasers or any type of product that will liquefy grease interceptor wastes;
         (b)   Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; or
         (c)   Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid
contents of the grease interceptor to the POTW.
      (3)   The influent to grease interceptors shall not exceed 140ºF/60ºC.
   (E)   Grease interceptor requirements.
      (1)   Grease interceptor sizing and installation shall conform to the
Indiana Plumbing Code, but in no instance shall a grease interceptor be less
than 1,000 gallons minimum capacity.
      (2)   Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with design
approved by the Joint Building Department and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
      (3)   Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it shall
be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of intercepted
grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building
where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the
approval of the Joint Building Department.
      (4)   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design
capability. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
         (a)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance
with the Indiana Plumbing Code;
         (b)   Remove any accumulated grease and sludge as required to maintain
minimum design capability; and
         (c)   Keep grease interceptors free of inorganic solid materials such
as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags
and the like, which could settle in the interceptor and thereby reduce the
effective volume of the device.
      (5)   Access manholes shall be provided over each grease interceptor
chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished
grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration.
The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection,
grease removal and wastewater sampling activities.
      (6)   (a)   Grease interceptors required under this section shall be
installed in all food service establishments unless the Joint Building
Department authorizes in writing the installation of an indoor grease trap or
other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation
of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The Joint Building Department shall
consider requests for installation of a grease trap or other alternative grease
removal device on a case-by-case basis noting that the city's preference is a
solution using a grease interceptor. If a user believes the installation of a
grease interceptor is infeasible, because of documented space constraints, the
request for consideration of an alternative grease removal device shall contain
the following information:
            1.   Location of sewer main and easements in relation to available
exterior space; and
            2.   General information about existing plumbing at the site.
         (b)   The Joint Building Department is under no obligation to approve
such request for use of a grease trap or other alternative grease removal
device, and if the Joint Building Department approves installation of a grease
trap or other grease removal device, such approval must be in writing.
   (F)   Grease interceptor and grease trap maintenance and design.
      (1)   Cleaning/pumping. The user, at the user's expense, shall maintain
all grease interceptors and grease traps to assure proper operation and
efficiency and maintain compliance with the city's pass through limits.
Maintenance of grease interceptors and grease traps shall include the complete
removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom
sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a qualified and licensed
hauler. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the grease
interceptor or grease trap from which it was removed or any other grease
interceptor or grease trap, for the purpose of reducing the volumeto be
disposed, is prohibited. This service shall also include a thorough inspection
of the grease interceptor or grease trap and its components. Any needed repairs
shall be noted by the inspecting city representative, provided in writing to
the user, and repaired at the user's expense.
      (2)   Disposal. All waste removed from each grease interceptor or grease
trap must be disposed of at a facility approved to receive such waste in
accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be
returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer system. All
pumpage from grease interceptors or grease traps must be tracked by a manifest,
which confirms pumping, hauling and disposal of waste. The user must obtain and
retain a copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
      (3)   Maintenance log. A grease interceptor or grease trap cleaning/
maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be
maintained by each food service establishment. This log shall include the date,
time, amount pumped, hauler and disposal site and shall be kept in a
conspicuous location for inspection. The log shall be made available to the
Joint Building Department or POTW representative upon request.
      (4)   Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease
interceptor or grease trap shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the
grease interceptor or grease trap. Each grease interceptor or grease trap shall
have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
      (5)   Construction. Grease interceptors or grease traps shall be
constructed in accordance with Indiana Plumbing Code standards and shall have a
minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All
grease removal devises or technologies shall be subject to the written approval
of the Joint Building Department. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated
removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
      (6)   Access. Access to grease interceptors or grease traps shall be
available at all times, to allow for their maintenance and inspection.
      (7)   Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas.)
      (8)   Sand, soil and oil interceptors. All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, car and truck maintenance facilities, fabricators,
utility equipment shops and other facilities (as determined by the Indiana
Plumbing Code) that have sources of sand, soil and oil shall install effective
sand, soil and oil traps, interceptors and/or oil/water separators. These
systems shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil and oil at the expected
flow rates. These systems shall be, at the user's expense, cleaned or pumped on
a regular basis to prevent impact upon the wastewater collection and treatment
systems. Users whose systems are deemed to be ineffective by the Joint Building
Department shall be required to change the cleaning frequency or to increase
the size of the system in the discretion of Municipal Utilities. Owners or
operators of washing facilities will be required to prevent the inflow of
detergents and rainwater into the wastewater collection system. Oil/water
separator installations shall be required at facilities that accumulate
petroleum oils and greases and at facilities deemed necessary by the Joint
Building Department.
      (9)   Laundries. Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that
prevents passage (into the wastewater collection system) of solids one-half
inch or larger in size such as rags, strings, buttons or other solids
detrimental to the system.

§ 52.102 DETERMINATION OF WATER USAGE.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates, except as is
hereinafter provided in this section. The city may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewerage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his or
her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for
determining of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids in the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or her expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 40,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters,
weirs, volumetric measuring devices to city's specifications or any adequate
and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination
of sewage discharge.
(`94 Code, § 53.03) (Ord. 5-1994, passed 6-6-94)
§ 52.103 BASIS OF CHARGE.
   In order that the rates and charges may reflect the costs of providing
service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also the strength and character of the stronger than normal
domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The
city shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage
and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage
system, in such manner and by such method as the city may deem practicable in
order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling
point available to the city at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of  * milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess
of * milligrams per liter of fluid; phosphorus in excess of  * milligrams per
liter of fluid; or ammonia nitrogen in excess of  * milligrams per liter of
fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger than normal domestic waste
shall equal the excessive strength surcharges set by the South Dearborn County
Regional Sewer District.
*The same levels as used for billing surcharges by South Dearborn Regional
Sewer District.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids, five-day Biochemical Oxygen
Demand, Ammonia Nitrogen and Phosphorous contained in the waste shall be in
accordance with the latest copy of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes," as written by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution
Control Federation, and in conformance with "Guidelines Establishing Test
Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants," Regulation CFR Part 136, published in
the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.

§ 52.104 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF RATES AND CHARGES; DELINQUENT RATES AND
CHARGES.
   (A)   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the
city in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
      (1)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly.
      (2)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in
the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties
served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining
whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such
examination shall be made at the office at which those records are kept and
during the hours that such office is open for business.
      (3)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due
are declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates
or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates or
charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the
bill.
      (4)   It is further ordained, pursuant to state law, that if any sewer
charge has been due and unpaid for a period of 30 days, the city, and the Board
of Public Works therefor, may discontinue water service upon a ten day written
notice, prior to the day upon which the water service is to be disconnected. Be
it further ordained, by authority of state law, that any sewer charge unpaid
shall be a lien against any real estate owned by the debtor and shall attach as
a lien at the time of the filing of the same in the County Recorder's office
and shall be supplier to, and take precedence over all other liens, except
taxes, and those sewer charges shall be by County Auditor, added to the tax
duplicate of the county, against the real estate involved, payable to the city.
   (B)   This city shall certify to the County Auditor a list of such
delinquent rates or charges, including a penalty as provided by law. Such list
will include the name or names of the owner or owners of each and every lot,
parcel of real estate or building involved, and a description of such premises,
and the Auditor will record the same in the office of the County Recorder.
   (C)   Not withstanding the above, the city reserves the right to take any
legal action required to collect delinquent sewer charges, including the right
to refuse all utility services to a new tenant renting, or owner purchasing,
property that is in arrears on sewer charges, until sewer charges are paid in
full to the utility company.

construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewerage system,
and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of such rates and
charges.
   (B)   The city is authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the city's
sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation of
the sewage treatment works of the city or to require methods affecting
pretreatment of those wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards included
in the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to
the sewage works.

(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.43 MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Whenever service is to be provided to a customer, the water utility
main shall be extended across the full length of the addressed side of the
customer's property. In the case of a corner lot with an extension originating
from the non-addressed side of the property, the requirement to extend across
the full length of the addressed side of the property will require that the
extension be constructed across the full length of both the non-addressed side
and the addressed side of the property. All costs associated with the
construction of the water utility main shall be paid by the customer.
   (B)   All mainline water mains whether public or private shall be a minimum
of eight inches in diameter, except dead-end mainline water mains serving
permanent residential cul-de-sacs a maximum of 400 feet in length and with a
maximum of 12 equivalent dwelling units may be six inches in diameter. Domestic
service connections shall be sized as prescribed by the water utility. It shall
be the customer's responsibility to coordinate sizing of each extension and
connection with the water utility.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.44 METERING.
   Connections to the water utility shall be metered as prescribed by the water
utility. Meters shall be located adjacent to the addressed side of the
customer's property. Unless specifically stated otherwise in the city
standards, all meters and appurtenances shall be furnished by the customer.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.45 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   For connections for owner-occupied residential structures which are
accepted by the water utility and whose meter pit is located immediately
adjacent to the right-of-way in accordance with city standards, the water
utility will maintain the meter and that portion of the connection from the
water utility main to the meter pit and the customer shall maintain the meter
appurtenances and the remaining portion of the connection.
   (B)   For connections for non-residential structures, for connections for
non-owner-occupied residential structures, or for connections that the water
utility elects to allow meters to remain or to be installed at locations NOT in
accordance with city standards, the water utility will maintain the meter and
that portion of the connection from the water utility main to the curb stop and
the customer shall maintain the meter appurtenances and the remaining portion
of the connection.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.46 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The materials, design, and construction of connections shall be in
accordance with city standards and shall be subject to review and comment by
the water utility. Connections which serve multi-family residential property or
are required to cross property lines shall be provided within a drainage and
utility easement throughout the entire system.
   (B)   It is recognized that the water utility must limit the allowable flow
to that flow which maintains 20 pounds per square inch pressure in the water
utility main. The water utility typically can provide approximately 1,500
gallons per minute at least 20 pounds per square inch.
   (C)   Private fire pumps and private water storage will typically be
required in cases where greater than the allowable flow and/or pressure is
required for a connection. The minimum requirement for private water storage
shall be based upon the requirement for the fire pump to be tested at 150% of
its rated capacity. Thus, the rated capacity of a fire pump system absent
private water storage shall be two-thirds of the allowable flow resulting in a
typical rated capacity of 1,000 gallons per minute. The water utility requires
that all private fire pump systems be provided with a pressure sensing control
device which automatically throttles the flow via a control valve placed on the
discharge side of the fire pump. Connections which require fire pumps and/or
water storage shall be independent and specific to each building. The customer
shall provide the water utility with the necessary observations and design
consultants such that the meter and connection sizing can be coordinated.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.47 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Whenever a cross connection control device of any kind is required,
bypassing shall be prohibited unless the bypass is provided with a similar
cross connection control device as the bypass constitutes a cross connection.
All cross connection devices shall be inspected and or tested by a registered
inspector at the time of installation and at intervals required by this
section. Reports of all inspections and tests shall be submitted to the water
utility and to the customer within 30 calendar days of the inspection or test.
The location and specification of cross connection control devices shall be as
required by the water utility.
   (B)   Air gaps shall terminate a minimum of two pipe diameters of the
discharge pipe or six inches, whichever is the lesser, above the rim of
receiving vessel, whichever is the higher. Air gaps shall be inspected at
intervals not exceeding 12 months to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
   (C)   Reduced pressure principle backflow preventers shall be installed
horizontally, with no plug or additional piping affixed to the pressure
differential relief valve port, and with the pressure differential relief valve
port a minimum of 12 inches above floor level. Additionally, the device must be
installed at a location where any leakage from the pressure differential relief
valve port will be noticed, and that allows access to the device for
maintenance and testing from floor level, and that will not subject the device
to flooding, excessive heat or freezing. Reduced pressure principle backflow
preventers shall be tested at intervals not exceeding 12 months.
   (D)   Double check valve assemblies shall be installed horizontally at a
location that allows access to the device for maintenance and testing from
floor level and that will not subject the device to excessive heat or freezing.
Double check valve assemblies shall be tested at intervals not exceeding 12
months.
   (E)   Pressure type vacuum breakers shall be installed as near as possible
to the irrigation facility, at a location that allows access to the device for
maintenance and testing from floor or ground level and that will not subject
the device to flooding, excessive heat or freezing. Additionally, the device
must be installed with its center line or datum point a minimum of 12 inches
above: the floor level, the highest downstream shut-off valve, and the highest
downstream overflow rim or discharge point. Pressure type vacuum breakers shall
be tested at intervals not exceeding 12 months.
   (F)   Except for connections for facilities which present a cross connection
hazard as defined by 327 IAC 8-10, connections to the water utility shall have
double check valve assemblies between the water utility and the customer.
   (G)   Connections for facilities which present a cross connection hazard as
defined by 327 IAC 8-10 shall have an air gap or a reduced pressure principle
backflow preventer between the water utility and the customer or component
thereof which presents the cross connection hazard.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
Statutory reference:
   Additional requirements, see 327 IAC 8-10.
§ 53.48 SECONDARY SOURCES OF SUPPLY.
   Storage tanks used only to store water from the water utility for
firefighting which are constructed to maintain the bacteriological quality of
the water shall be isolated from the water utility, by an air gap, reduced
pressure principle backflow preventer, or double check valve assembly. Other
secondary sources of supply shall NOT be physically connected to a connection
served by the water utility.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.49 LAND IRRIGATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   With regard to water used for land irrigation, relief from sewage
charges which are based upon metered flows of the water utility will NOT be
granted.
   (B)   Land irrigation facilities constructed after July 19, 1985 which:
receive flow from the water utility, are buried below ground, and have
sprinkling outlets located less than six inches above grade, shall be isolated
from the water utility by an air gap, reduced pressure principle backflow
preventer, or pressure type vacuum breaker.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.50 SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Connections that are greater than or equal to four inches in diameter
shall be completely flushed, shall have connection valves exercised, and shall
have connection fire hydrants exercised at intervals not exceeding 12 months.
Given that serious problems may result from unregulated flushing, the water
utility shall be notified in writing at least seven calendar days in advance of
any flushing operation such that the water utility can authorize a time and
date for flushing. A customer affidavit stating that flushing, valve
exercising, and fire hydrant exercising has occurred shall be submitted to the
water utility within 24 hours of the occurrence.
   (B)   In the event that the customer fails to provide an affidavit of
flushing to the water utility within 24 hours of flushing, the water utility
may cause the main to be flushed and the customer may be subject to a fee
established by "An Ordinance Establishing Fees and Permits for the City of
Lawrenceburg."
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)
§ 53.51 NON-SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.
   Connections may be subject to non-scheduled maintenance per the requirements
of the water utility. The water utility may require immediate non-scheduled
main flushing. In the event that the customer fails to provide an affidavit of
flushing to the water utility within 24 hours of a non-scheduled flushing
request by the water utility, the water utility may cause the main to be
flushed and the customer may be subject to a fee established by "An Ordinance
Establishing Fees and Permits for the City of Lawrenceburg," including any
amendments to or replacements of such ordinance.
(Ord. 5-2012, passed 3-13-12)

company license, the number of the taxicab license between three and five
inches in height on the rear of such taxicab, and a taxicab license plate
bearing the number of the license and the year of issuance.
   (B)   The taxicab may bear an identifying color, color scheme or design
approved by the Board of Public Works. To promote uniform standards and to
assist the public in identifying taxi companies, all taxicabs licensed under
the same company name shall bear the same design or logo as the other taxicabs
licensed under the same company name. No taxicab covered by the terms of this
section shall be licensed whose color scheme, identifying design, monogram or
insignia to be used thereon shall conflict with or imitate any color scheme,
identifying design, monogram or insignia used on taxicabs already operating
under this section, in such a manner as to be misleading or tend to deceive or
defraud the public. If after a license has been issued for a taxicab, the color
scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia thereof is changed so as to be
in conflict with or imitate any color scheme, identifying design, monogram or
insignia used by any other person, owner or operator, in such a manner as to be
misleading or tend to deceive the public, the license covering such taxicab
shall be suspended or revoked. The taxicab owner is expected to comply with
these guidelines and regulations.
   (C)   If a company ceases use of a vehicle as a taxicab, the company
operator shall immediately remove the city license plate, company name, taxicab
number and all other letters or numbers identifying the vehicle as a taxicab.
The company operator shall return the license plate to the city within one
business day after the company ceases use of the vehicle as a taxicab. The
failure of the company operator to comply with this requirement may result in
fines and enforcement procedures.

of all rates charged. The rate must be the same as that set forth in the
company application or the most recent change of rate notice provided to the

is answering the telephone or dispatching taxicabs. No taxi company may accept
calls or dispatch taxicabs from a taxicab or from a property that is not
properly zoned. They shall answer all calls received by them for services
inside the corporate limits of the city as soon as they can do so. If the
services cannot be rendered within a reasonable time, they shall then notify
the prospective passengers how long it will be before the call can be answered
and give the reason therefor. The failure of a company license holder to have a
telephone call for service answered within in a reasonable time shall result in
the issuance of fines, license suspension or revocation, or other sanctions as
provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Refusal of service. Any taxicab company or taxicab driver that refuses
to accept a call anywhere in the corporate limits of the city at any time when
such company or driver has available taxicabs, or who fails or refuses to give
overall taxicab service, shall be deemed a violator of this section. The
license granted to such violator may be revoked or suspended, or the violator
may receive a citation. However, any taxicab driver or company shall have the
right to refuse service to a drunk or disorderly person, or to a person who has
previously refused to pay the legal fare, or to a person who has threatened or
menaced the taxicab driver. Any taxicab company shall also have the right to
make reasonable policies and rules for the safety of its drivers and
passengers, so long as it does not engage in illegal discrimination or refuse
to render overall service.
   (C)   Manifest required; retention. Every taxicab driver shall maintain a
daily manifest upon which are recorded all trips made each day, showing time
and place of origin and destination of each trip and amount of fare. Every
taxicab driver shall give all completed manifests to the operator at the
conclusion of each tour of duty. The forms for each manifest shall be furnished
to the driver by the operator and shall be of a character approved by the
Clerk-Treasurer. The company license holder shall provide the manifest to the
City Clerk-Treasurer, Lawrenceburg Police Department or City Attorney’s Office
within 24 hours of any request made in writing via mail, facsimile or
electronic correspondence. The failure of a driver or a company holder to
comply with this subsection may result in fines, suspension or revocation of

Measures within a 60 day period prior to the issuance or renewal of the

yards or portion thereof, $25 plus.
   (B)   Inspection fee: $10 per inspection or $10 per hour.
(`94 Code, § 151.37)
§ 151.38 DENIAL.
   The City Engineer shall deny a grading permit where, in his or her opinion,
the work as proposed by the applicant may endanger any property or any street
or alley or fails to meet city standards. In determining whether the proposed
work is likely to endanger any property, streets, or alleys, or create
hazardous conditions, the City Engineer shall give due consideration to:
possible saturation by rains, earth movements, run-off or surface waters and
subsurface conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, and the
nature and type of the soil or rock.
(`94 Code, § 151.38)
§ 151.39 EXPIRATION.
   Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if
the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within six months or
is not completed within one year from the date of issue. The City Engineer may,
if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties
have prevented work being started or completed within the specified time
limits, grant reasonable extensions of time, not to exceed three month
extensions, provided the application for extension of time is made before the
date of expiration of the permit.
(`94 Code, § 151.39)
DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
§ 151.50 ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS.
   Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall as a minimum
meet the standards and specifications of the city.
(`94 Code, § 151.50)
§ 151.51 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PRINCIPLES.
   The following measures are hereby approved as effective means for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the control
plan:
   (A)   Stripping of vegetation, grading or other development shall be done in
such a way as to minimize erosion.
   (B)   Grading and development plans shall preserve salient natural features,
keep cut and fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and adequately handle
the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
   (C)   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and
supplemented.
   (D)   The undisturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
   (E)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
   (F)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect exposed
critical areas during development.
   (G)   The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control
measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
   (H)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development; where necessary, the rate of surface water runoff shall be
mechanically retarded.
   (I)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed area
is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or
similar measures.
(`94 Code, § 151.51)
§ 151.52 GRADING FOR DRAINAGE.
   In order to provide more suitable sites for building and other uses and to
improve surface drainage and control erosion, the following requirements shall
be met:
   (A)   All lots, tracts or parcels shall be finally graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding, and all land
within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding, except where approved by the Common Council on the
recommendation of the City Engineer.
   (B)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to adequately
handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a
curbed street, storm drain, or natural watercourse. When drainage swales are
used to divert surface waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or
planted as required and shall be of such slope, shape and size as to conform
with the recommendations of the City Engineer.
   (C)   Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses.
(`94 Code, § 151.52)
§ 151.53 EXCAVATION AND FILLS.
   (A)   Slopes created by cut or fill shall not be steeper than 2.5:1 unless
stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing except where approved by the City
Engineer.
   (B)   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills.
   (C)   Cut and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
   (D)   All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of material and to
prevent undesirable settlement. The fill shall be spread in a series of layers,
each not exceeding 12 inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by a
sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each layer is spread. The City
Engineer may require tests or other information if in his or her opinion the
conditions or materials are such that additional information is necessary.
   (E)   Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses, constructed channels
or flood plain areas.
   (F)   Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses, constructed channels or
flood plains shall have suitable protection against erosion during periods of
flooding.
   (G)   Grading shall not be done in such a way as to divert water onto the
property of another landowner.
   (H)   During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control shall
be exercised and sediment deposits on public highways should be minimized and
cleaned at the direction of the City Engineer.
   (I)   Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or
earth, the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
      (1)   The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time, the
time limit to be determined by the City Engineer and to be specified on the
grading permit.
      (2)   Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth not less than six inches and sufficient to
conceal all materials other than clean soil or earth within the fill. Where the
nature of the fill requires, the City Engineer may require clean soil or earth
to be placed over the top and exposed surfaces of the fill to a depth
sufficient to conceal all materials at the end of each day's operations.
      (3)   No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of materials
other than clean soil or earth until a faithful performance bond in the amount
of the City Engineer's estimated cost of adequately covering such fill with
clean soil or earth has been furnished to the city. The bond shall be executed
by a corporate surety, or by the principal, as the city may require, and shall
be subject to the approval of the City Attorney as to form. In lieu of the
bond, a cash deposit in such amount may be made with the city or with a bank or
trust company, approved by the City Attorney which shall act as escrow agent.
(`94 Code, § 151.53) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.98 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, enlarge, alter,
repair or maintain any grading, excavation or fills or cause the same to be
done, contrary to or in violation of any provision of this chapter.
   (B)   When written notice of a violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter has been served by the City Engineer on any person, the violation shall
be discontinued immediately.
(`94 Code, § 151.98) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable
on conviction thereof to a penalty as provided in §
10.99 for each and every offense, and whenever such person shall have been
notified by a city official by service of summons in a prosecution or other
written notice that he or she is committing such violation of this chapter,
each day that he or she shall continue the violation after the notification
shall constitute a separate offense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4, granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health.
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains.
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES, flood
waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived, from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the ADDITION is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed ADDITION, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;

         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing, resurfacing
roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING (WET FLOODPROOFING). The permanent or contingent measures
applied to a structure and/or its contents that prevent or provide resistance
to damage from flooding by allowing water to enter the structure. This method
is only permitted by variance.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional HARDSHIP
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,1997,
will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars; or
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls, and if a structure has more than one enclosed
area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area, and the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929, a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. (See
REGULATORY FLOOD.)
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections,
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for
recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.

where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The REGULATORY FLOOD elevation at any location is
as defined in 152.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term base
flood, 1% annual chance flood, and 100-year flood.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city are
generally identified as such on the Dearborn County, Indiana, and incorporated
areas flood insurance rate maps dated April 16, 2014, as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A STRUCTURE that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, and X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B and C.)

dated April 16, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date,
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with
the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better
data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must
be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review,
subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 152.11 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.

such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (D)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (E)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
   (F)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/
or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
   (G)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA
for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.43 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in 152.07, are areas designated as
floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under
the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance
of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or
obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation
activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However,
it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful)
residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows
construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-
boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 have been met. The improvement location permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees), the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.45 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.46 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development,
an improvement location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
improvement location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
152.40 through
152.47 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
regulatory flood more than fourteen hundredths of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)
§ 152.47 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
152.40 through
152.47.
(Ord. 3-2014, passed 3-17-14)

thoroughfares, or unsubdivided lands as may be required by the Plan Commission.
Minor residential streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by
nonlocal traffic.
   (B)   Consistent with adjoining street layout. The arrangement of streets
shall make provision for the continuation of the principal existing or proposed
streets in adjoining areas, or their proper projection where adjoining land is
not subdivided, insofar as they are necessary for public requirements.
   (C)   Not to cause hardship to adjoining owners. The street layout shall be
such as not to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat
their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. The Plan
Commission may require land to be reserved for future street purposes to be
developed by an adjacent land owner at a later date.
   (D)   Streets extended to subdivision boundary lines. Proposed streets shall
be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless
prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion
of the Plan Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the

temporary dead end streets may be approved where necessitated by the layout of
the subdivision or staging of development; provided that temporary paved
turnarounds shall be constructed at the end of such streets in cases where more
than eight lots front on the street. The width of right-of-way or temporary
easement shall be the same as that required for permanent turnarounds. The
extra right-of-way in excess of the street right-of-way shall be vacated upon
extension of the temporary street, and the reconditioning of the street, all
surface improvements, and front yards concerned shall be carried out at the
expense of the subdivider responsible for the extension of the temporary dead
end street.
   (I)   Half-streets. Dedication of half-streets shall not be permitted except

§ 153.045 PARKS AND RECREATION DEDICATION FEES.
   (A)   Requirements. As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel map,
the subdivider shall dedicate usable land, for a fee in lieu thereof, or both,
at the option of the Plan Commission, for park or recreational purposes at the
time and according to the standards and formula contained in this section. The
term "usable land" shall mean land so located in relation to public streets or
rights-of-way as to be accessible to the public and shall be of such grade and
shape as to be usable by the city for the purpose of parks, playgrounds or
other recreational facilities as is consistent with other parks, playgrounds or
recreational facilities in the city existing at the time of dedication.
   (B)   General standard. It is found and determined that the public interest,
convenience, health, welfare and safety require that ten acres of property for
each 1,000 persons residing within this city are to be devoted to local park
and recreational purposes. (Per acreage standard .01 acres per person.)
   (C)   Land dedication formula.  
      (1)   The subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in
size and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision. The amount of
land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following standards and
formula.
      (2)   The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as
follows:
   Average number of person per dwelling unit (DU) x park acreage standard.
(Example, for single-family dwelling unit: 4.0 x .01 = .04).
      (3)   The following table of population density is to be followed.
   Park Land Dedication Formula Table
 
Dwelling Type                      Assumed Density Standard
Single family                      4.0 persons/DU  1 acre/25 DUs
Duplex, low density apartments     3.0 persons/DU  1 acre/33 DUs
Medium and high density apartments 2.5 persons/DU  1 acre/40 DUs
 
      (4)   Dedication of land shall be made in accordance with the procedures
contained in this section.
   (D)   Formula for fees in lieu of dedication.
      (1)   General formula. If there is a park or recreational facility in the
city located so as to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of
the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee
equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in division (C)
hereof, such fee to be used as hereafter stated.
      (2)   Use of money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for
the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to
serving the subdivision by way of the purchase of necessary land, or, if the
Common Council deems that there is sufficient land available for the park, for
improving of such land for park and recreational purposes.
      (3)   Basis. An "in lieu fee" shall be required by the Common Council
based on the fair market value (F.M.V.) of the land which would have been
dedicated for park and recreation purposes.
   (E)   Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. In subdivisions of
over 50 lots, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu
there, in accordance with the following formula: when only a portion of land to
be subdivided is proposed on the general plan as the site for a local park,
such portion shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee, computed
pursuant to the provisions of division (C) hereof, shall be paid in an amount
equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be
dedicated pursuant to division (C) hereof, such fees to be used for the
improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the
improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area
serving the subdivision.
   (F)   Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. Where a fee is required to
be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon
the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required
to be dedicated pursuant to division (C) hereof. The " fair market value," as
set by the Plan Commission, shall be determined at the time of filing the
tentative map or parcel. If the subdivider disagrees with the fair market value
(F.M.V.), as set by the Plan Commission, the subdivider and Plan Commission
shall agree upon a disinterested appraiser to reach an agreed upon (F.M.V.).
The subdivider shall pay the appraisal costs.
   (G)   Determination of land or fee.
      (1)   Whether the Plan Commission accepts land dedication or elects to
require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be
determined by consideration of the following:
         (a)   Recreational element of the city's general plan;
         (b)   Topography, geology, access and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
         (c)   Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication;
         (d)   The feasibility of dedication;
         (e)   Availability of previously acquired park property.
      (2)   The determination of the Plan Commission as to whether land shall
be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof,
shall be final and conclusive.
   (H)   Commencement of development. At the time of approval of the final
subdivision map, the Common Council shall specify when development of the park
and recreational facilities shall be commenced and finished.
   (I)   Credit for private open space.
      (1)   Partial credit. Where private open space for park and recreational
purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be
privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision,
partial credit, not to exceed 70%, may be given against the requirement of land
dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the Plan Commission finds that
it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are
met:
         (a)   That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required
to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall
not be included in the computation of such private open space;
         (b)   That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or
restrictions;
         (c)   That the use of the private open space is restricted for park
and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in
favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or
eliminated without the consent of the Plan Commission or its successor;
         (d)   That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for
use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location;
         (e)   That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the general plan;
and
         (f)   That the open space for which credit is given is a minimum of
three acres and provides all (or a minimum of five) of the local park basic
elements listed below, or a combination of such and other recreational
improvements that will meet the specific recreation park needs of the future
residents of the area:
 
Recreation                          Acres
Children's play apparatus area      0.50 to 0.75
Landscape park-like and quiet areas 0.50 to 1.00
Family picnic areas                 0.25 to 0.75
Game court area                     0.25 to 0.75
Turf play field                     2.0 to 4.0
 
      (2)   Prerequisite findings. Before credit is given, the Plan Commission
shall make written findings that the above standards are met and that the land
or in lieu fees are adequate to provide park facilities for the general public
use.
   (J)   Procedure.
      (1)   At the time of approval of the tentative map, the Plan Commission
shall determine pursuant to division (C) hereof the land to be dedicated and/or
fees to be paid by the subdivider.
      (2)   At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map, the
subdivider shall dedicate the land, as previously determined by the Plan
Commission. Where the Plan Commission has determined that fees shall be paid in
lieu of or in addition to the dedication of land, the subdivider shall pay said
fees in accordance with the following schedule: for any subdivision consisting
of two or more lots, the fees shall be paid, in their entirety, prior to the
issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located
upon any lot in the subdivision.
      (3)   Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities
shall be submitted to the Plan Commission prior to approval of the final
subdivision map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final
subdivision map.

copies and the original marked copy to the City Engineer. The City Engineer
will review these plans to see that all revisions have been made.
      (5)   The City Engineer will review these plans to see that all other
revisions have been made and if so, he or she will approve and sign these
plans. If corrections are not satisfactory to the City Engineer, he or she will
send one marked copy to the developer with instructions to correct and
resubmit.
      (6)   As a matter of policy, the City Engineer may in all cases above
correspond directly with the developer's consultant with the developer's
permission in writing. The City Engineer will submit one signed copy to the
Plan Commission with his or her approval report.
   (B)   Primary plat- Plan Commission hearing (primary approval or disapproval
of plat).
      (1)   The Plan Commission will discuss and approve the plans after any
required changes are accomplished.

copy back to the developer. The developer will correct all revisions and send
the marked copy and corrected copies to the City Engineer. The City Engineer
will review the plans to see that all revisions have been corrected and, if so,
he or she will sign and approve the plans. If corrections are not satisfactory
to the City Engineer, he or she will send one marked copy to the developer with
instruction to correct and resubmit.
      (3)   The City Engineer will determine the amount of performance bond
required, if any, for all public improvements. The City Engineer will notify
the developer of total amount of bond required, if any.
      (4)   The developer will post the necessary bond with the Clerk-Treasurer
of the city who will notify the City Engineer in writing that the bond has been
received.

existing nonconforming uses in the same district nor because of uses in an
adjoining district.

designated on the Zoning Map are bounded approximately by lot lines, such lot
lines shall be construed to be the boundary of districts unless the boundaries

included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner;
               c.   The need for the variance arises from some condition

bulk, or area:
               a.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;
               b.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner;

will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property;
               d.   The variance represents the smallest deviation possible;
and
               e.   The approval is not based upon legally existing
nonconformities of a similar nature in the same zoning district nor regulations
from other zoning districts.
         (b)   Applications for variances shall include sufficient information
in order to clearly state the facts surrounding the variance request and shall
comply with the provisions of §
154.29(C) and (D), as amended below, regarding the parties who receive notices
and substituting the Board for the referenced Plan Commission and Common
Council.
         (c)   The following notification requirements and procedures shall

information presented with the petition. Petitions for amendments submitted by
the Plan Commission shall be accompanied by its own resolution pertaining to
such proposed amendment.

affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the Common Council.
         (b)   Failure of the Common Council to pass the proposed amendment
with the affirmative vote within 90 days after its rejection by the Plan

§ 154.30 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Creation and purpose.
      (1)   A Planned Unit Development District is hereby established as an
overlay zoning classification. Such District shall not stand by itself, but
shall be combined with an existing district. Land hereafter zoned “Planned Unit
Development District” shall bear the map designation of “PUD” along with the
applicable symbol of the existing zoning classification.
      (2)   It is the intent of the PUD District to provide land use and design
regulations through the use of individual performance criteria, wherein review
and approval of a development plan is required by the Plan Commission to ensure
that all proposed development will be compatible with surrounding property and
that there will be adequate infrastructure to serve the development, so that
small-to-large scale neighborhoods, or portions thereof, may be developed with
a combination or variety of residential and nonresidential uses, which are
planned and developed as a unit.
      (3)   This section specifically encourages innovations so that the
growing demand for housing may be met by a greater variety of type, design and
placement of dwellings through the conservation and more efficient use of land.
This section also encourages the conservation and more efficient use of the
land for nonresidential development.
      (4)   This section recognizes that a rigid set of space requirements,
along with building and use specifications, would frustrate the application of
this concept. Therefore, where PUD techniques are deemed appropriate, land may
be designated as a PUD Zoning District. When an area is so designated, the use
and dimensional specifications elsewhere in this chapter are replaced by an
approval process in which an approved development plan, as allowed in I.C. 36-
7-4-1500 et seq., becomes the basis for continuing land use control. It should
be noted that it is not the intent to solely utilize PUD zoning as a way to
circumvent and/or avoid current rezoning processes and/or requirements and
standards found elsewhere in this chapter.
   (B)   Objectives. To carry out the intent of this section, a PUD should
provide:
      (1)   A choice in the types of environment, occupancy tenure, types of
housing, types of ownership and community facilities available to existing and
potential residents;
      (2)   Useable open space and recreation areas;
      (3)   Sidewalks and/or shared use trails along public streets and within
the development;
      (4)   Convenience in the location of accessory commercial and service
areas;
      (5)   Preservation of natural topographical and geological features with
emphasis on:
         (a)   Prevention of soil erosion;
         (b)   Conservation of existing surface and subsurface water; and
         (c)   Preservation of tree cover and other environmentally enhancing
features.
      (6)   An efficient network of streets and utilities;
      (7)   The development of a land use pattern in harmony with the
objectives of the City’s Master Plan; and
      (8)   A more efficient utilization of the land than might be obtained
through other development procedures.
   (C)   Definitions. As used in this section, the following words shall mean:
      COMMON OPEN SPACE. An area within a PUD designated and intended for the
use or enjoyment of all residents of the development or for use and enjoyment
of the general public.
      CONCEPT PLAN. A plan for the development of an entire parcel of land,
drawn to scale, that generally indicates densities, uses and infrastructure
locations including common and limited common open space, and which expresses
in general the development requirements which apply.
      DEVELOPMENT PLAN. A specific plan for the development of real property
which includes a site plan; contains the plan documentation and supporting
information required by this section; and satisfies the development
requirements specified in this section.
      LIMITED COMMON OPEN SPACE. An area within a PUD designed and intended for
the use and enjoyment of only the residents of the development.
      OPEN SPACE. Any parcel or area of land or water essentially unimproved
and set aside, dedicated, designated or reserved for public or private use or

district upon its property (hereinafter referred to as “applicant”) shall
comply with the following procedures:
         (a)   The applicant shall meet with the Planning Department staff to
discuss the concept plan, review the PUD approval process, and obtain the PUD
application form.
         (b)   The applicant shall file an application for rezoning of its
property to a PUD District, along with a concept plan and draft of a
development plan for a PUD with the Planning Department in accordance with
forms provided by the Planning Department.
         (c)   A Planning Department staff review of the concept plan shall be
completed and suggestions or changes may be recommended by the staff. A meeting
with the applicant shall be scheduled to review staff comments.
         (d)   The application for rezoning and the revised concept plan shall
be presented to the Plan
Commission for recommendation in a properly advertised public hearing pursuant
to I.C. 5-3-1.
         (e)   The Plan Commission may approve or disapprove the plan after
review; request possible modification; make a recommendation to City Council
regarding the concept plan, and the request that the land parcel be rezoned
PUD. If the Plan Commission recommends approval of the PUD, a PUD District
ordinance shall be proposed at this time.
         (f)   City Council shall consider the recommendation of the Plan
Commission and staff and vote on the PUD District, which will include the
concept plan and any other general requirements adopted by Council, which will
also be attached as an exhibit. The draft development plan with any written
commitments or changes will also be attached as an exhibit.
         (g)   If the PUD District is approved by Council, an ordinance is
prepared. The applicant shall then file a primary plat and final development
plan with the Planning Department, which document shall be scheduled and
properly advertised for public hearing before the Plan Commission. In
conjunction herewith, pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1511, City Council hereby
delegates to the Plan Commission:
            1.   Authority to conduct secondary review of a PUD District
ordinance under I.C. 36-7-4-1509(c); and
            2.   Authority to modify permitted uses or development requirements
that are specified in a PUD District ordinance.
         (h)   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on the Primary
Plat and secondary review of the Final Development Plan and PUD District
ordinance.
         (i)   The primary plat and final development plan shall be considered
and either approved or denied by the Plan Commission, as submitted or with
required changes.
         (j)   Upon approval of the development plan, the secondary plat shall
be prepared by the applicant and filed with the Planning Department, including
all final engineering calculations.
         (k)   The secondary plat shall be considered for approval by the Plan
Commission, and upon approval the secondary plat and final development plan
shall be recorded by the applicant. The applicant shall return a copy of the
recorded Plat to the Planning Department.
      (2)   If implementation of a PUD is not started within a period of 12
months, meaning no activity is taking place on a site including marketing of
parcels, the applicant must submit a request to the Plan Commission for a 12-
month extension with an explanation for the reason for the delay. If, after an
additional 12 months with no activity, the Development Plan may be revoked by
Plan Commission action. Notwithstanding such revocation, the PUD shall remain
in place, unless the Commission initiates a rezoning petition to the prior
zoning category.
   (F)   Uses. All land uses for buildings and property shall be specified in
the development plan.
   (G)   General requirements.

necessary, by fully recorded covenants running with the land.
         (e)   Dedicated streets or highways shall be subject to all applicable
municipal, county or state standards.
         (f)   Right-of-way and pavement widths for internal streets and alleys
serving single unit attached or detached dwelling, multiple-family dwellings,
townhouse clusters and commercial or industrial developments shall be
determined from sound planning and engineering standards in conformity with the
following: Estimated needs of the full development proposed and the traffic to
be generated and shall be adequate and sufficient in size, location and design
to accommodate the maximum traffic, parking and loading needs and the access of
fire fighting equipment and other emergency vehicles. In such instance, other

Commission and Council, and shall make reasonable provision for service to the
connections with adjoining properties in other ownership by extending easements
to their property boundary. In the event that street lighting is not required
by the Plan Commission or City Council as a condition of PUD approval, the
applicant shall install a conduit to the specifications set forth by the local
utility for the potential future installation of lighting.
      (5)   The applicant shall provide open space/recreation areas, in every
instance, in a manner consistent with good planning practices based on the
individual characteristics present in each Planned Unit Development. The open

Council.
      (2)   No commercial building shall be built until 50% of the residential
buildings are completed.
      (3)   Minimum area of lots and dimensions and setbacks of individual
buildings on lots within the PUD shall be determined as part of the PUD

   (I)   Commercial PUDs. All commercial and mixed use PUDs shall be in
compliance with the following regulations:
      (1)   All commercial PUDs abutting a permitted residential or recreation
use shall provide a minimum 25 foot greenbelt along the entire shared boundary
and include landscaping, earth berms, and screen walls or fencing as approved
by the Plan Commission. Streets, sidewalks and driveways within the PUD may be
extended through the greenbelt in order to connect with streets and sidewalks
outside the PUD.
      (2)   All commercial PUDs shall provide a minimum 10 foot greenbelt
around the perimeter of the development abutting non-residential or non-
recreation uses. This greenbelt shall not be considered part of the required
open space.

   (K)   Variances.
      (1)   A requested variance to any specific regulation within this section
shall be submitted as part of the development plan. Variances shall be
determined acceptable if the Plan Commission finds:
         (a)   The general requirements of this section would cause unnecessary
hardship or practical difficulties because of exceptional and unique
topography, access, location, shape, size, drainage or other physical features
of the site; or
         (b)   That due to the size, shape, location, permitted use or
uniqueness of the development, a variance would constitute good planning and
would not unreasonably affect the public health, safety, morals or welfare, or
the rights of adjacent property owners.
      (2)   All variances adopted by the Plan Commission based on the above
findings, shall be part of the approved development plan and may include
conditions imposed by the Plan Commission to substantially secure objectives of
this section.
      (3)   For variances requested after the secondary plat and/or final
development plan has been approved, §
154.16(D)(5) shall apply. All approved variances shall be recorded on the plat.
   (L)   Concept plan and development plan procedures.
      (1)   PUD applicants shall present a concept plan and preliminary
development plan to the Planning Department staff for review. Following a
meeting with the staff, the applicant shall submit revised plans and related
documents in the PUD submittal requirements checklist provided by the city at
least 30 days before the respective public hearing of the Plan Commission. The
petition shall include a list of all property owners within 200 feet of the PUD
and a legal description of the PUD. The Planning Department staff shall review
both and advertise the hearing date before the Planning Commission. The Plan
Commission shall, if all issues are resolved, make a recommendation on the
concept plan to the Council for their action.
      (2)   A proposed primary plat for a PUD shall be filed with the Planning
Department as part of the preliminary development plan.
      (3)   At least 30 days before the Plan Commission public hearing for the
Final Development Plan, the PUD applicant shall submit the required multiple
copies to the planning staff of a primary plat and final development plan. The
Planning Department will set a public hearing for the Plan Commission. The Plan
Commission shall within 30 days of the completed public hearing approve or deny
the primary plat with “findings of fact.” If the Plan Commission approves the
primary plat, final development plan and PUD findings of fact, the applicant
can then present a secondary plat.
      (4)   If the Plan Commission denies the primary plat or the final
development plan, it must specify reasons in a “findings of fact” statement.
The Plan Commission may recommend further study of the site and/or development
plan and resubmission at a later date. Approval of a primary plat does not
obligate the Plan Commission to approve a secondary plat.
      (5)   An approved final development plan and primary plat is valid for 12
months. If no secondary plat is submitted for approval within 12 months, the
PUD applicant must appear before the Plan Commission and request an extension
of up to 12 months. If not approved, the zoning reverts to its prior
classification. The Plan Commission may approve or deny the extension.

approves a primary plat. The secondary plat will be placed on a Plan Commission
agenda. It does not require a public hearing. The Plan Commission shall have a
maximum of 30 days to approve or deny a secondary plat following the Plan
Commission meeting. Approval of a secondary plat does not authorize
construction unless construction plans, building permits and any necessary
surety have also been approved. The recording of the approved secondary plat
shall inform all whom deal with the PUD of the restrictions placed on the land
and act as a zoning control device.
      (2)   Content of a PUD secondary plat. All PUD secondary plats shall

§ 154.32 CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Purpose. To insure that these uses, as designated by this chapter, in
their proposed locations will be compatible with surrounding development.
   (B)   Required review.  Conditionally permitted uses shall be reviewed and
determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals subsequent to the Plan Commission
reviewing and forwarding its findings and recommendations to the Board. In
order to promote and effectuate the purpose of this chapter, additional
restrictions and/or conditions may be deemed necessary and be imposed by the
Board as part of any approval it grants.
      (1)   In considering an application for any conditionally permitted use,
the Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals shall give due regard to the
following factors as they apply to a particular situation:
         (a)   The nature, location, size and site layout of the use so that it
shall be harmonious with the area and district in which it is proposed;
         (b)   The nature and integrity of the operations involved in, or
connected with, the use;
         (b)   The nature and integrity of the operations involved in, or
connected with, the use;
         (c)   The site layout of the use, including parking location, design,
screening, and number of off-street spaces; and
         (d)   The relationship of the use to the streets providing access to
it, so that vehicular traffic to and from the use will not create undue hazards
to the normal traffic of the vicinity. The following traffic issues, at a
minimum, shall be considered:
            1.   Vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of traffic
flow;
            2.   Relation to street intersections;
            3.   Sight distances; and
            4.   Pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   No conditionally permitted uses shall exceed the maximum allowable
height for the district in which it is proposed, unless:
         (a)   An existing structure already exceeding the height limit is
being utilized, or
         (b)   Sufficient cause is shown and determined to be necessary by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. In such instances, the height can be increased by only
one story.
      (3)   All conditionally permitted uses shall, at the least, meet the
minimum setback (yard) requirements for the district in which it is proposed.
Wherever possible, increased setbacks shall be provided with appropriate
landscaping (refer to §
154.39).
   (C)   All conditionally permitted uses which existed upon the effective date
of this chapter and which are located in a district which permits such use in
accordance with this section shall be regarded as conforming uses. Expansion or
extension to such uses shall be subject to all provisions of this section.
   (D)   All conditionally permitted uses hereafter authorized by the Board of
Zoning Appeals to be in accordance with this section shall be regarded as
conforming uses and may be continued, except that
major changes in layout, expansion or extension to such use shall be subject to
review and approval procedures as set forth elsewhere in this section.
   (E)   Uses not permitted. Any uses not permitted by right in accordance with
the regulations of the various districts established by this chapter and any
uses other than those designated as conditionally permitted uses by this
section shall not be permitted. Any request for uses other than those permitted
in this section shall first be considered by the Plan Commission for a
determination as to whether or not they should be designated as conditionally
permitted uses, pursuant to the definition and purpose of conditionally
permitted uses.
   (F)   Applications. Applications for conditionally permitted uses shall
include all items as required by §
154.29, Site Plan Review.
   (G)   Notification requirements.
      (1)   Written notice, by certified mail, shall be sent to all property
owners within 200 feet of the subject parcel(s) no less than ten days prior to
the meeting date of the Plan Commission wherein the application will be
reviewed. If the matter is continued to additional meetings, written notice may
be sent to the same property owners at the discretion of the Plan Commission.
Such notice shall state the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting.
      (2)   No legal notice is required for the Plan Commission meeting.
      (3)   Written notice for the Board’s public hearing shall follow the same
procedures as in division (G)(1) above.
      (4)   Legal notice for the hearing shall be given by one publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten days before the date
of such hearing and state the same information as that required in the written
notice and shall otherwise comply with I.C. 5-3-1.

§ 154.33 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES.
   (A)   (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish supplemental
regulations for the review of accessory buildings and uses. Accessory buildings
and uses may be permitted within specified zoning districts as customary,
incidental, related, or subordinate uses to a principal use of a site as long
as such uses do not change, alter, or impose an unacceptable impact on the
character of the principal use.
      (2)   An accessory building and/or use shall not be established unless a
principal use has first been established on a site in conformance with all
applicable provisions of this chapter and shall in all cases be located behind
the principal structure.
   (B)   If and when accessory buildings and uses are proposed that are not
specifically provided for in this chapter, the Plan Commission shall first
determine whether or not such proposed accessory buildings and/or uses shall be
designated as such, with due regard being given to division (A) above.
   (C)   Home occupations. Each accessory building and use permitted within
specified zoning districts and listed below is required to conform to the
provisions of §
154.38. Certain home occupations are permitted as accessory uses in dwelling
units, so long as they are clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the
dwelling for residential purposes. Home occupations shall not change the
character of the residential use and shall not adversely affect the principal
permitted uses in the district of which they are a part. The nature of home
occupations as an accessory use relative to its location and conduct of
activity is such that the average neighbor, under normal circumstances, would
not be aware of its existence.
      (1)   Application for improvement permit. All persons wishing to conduct
a home occupation shall apply for an improvement location permit from the
staff, as designated pursuant to §
154.14, showing that the provisions of this section will be met during the
entire time the home occupation exists. The designated staff may issue such a
permit for a period of not more than two years. Upon expiration of the permit,
the staff may issue a new permit, provided that all applicable provisions
continue to be complied with. Any permit issued pursuant to these regulations
may be revoked at any time should the designated staff determine that the
provisions of this section are not being met.
      (2)   Permitted home occupations. The following list is only illustrative
as to the type and scale of home occupations which can normally be conducted
within the provisions of this section. Other similar uses which meet the intent
and regulations of this section may be permitted at the discretion of the
designated staff. If there is any question regarding the appropriateness of a
proposed home occupation, the matter shall be directed to the Plan Commission
for its determination. Any home occupation that does not comply with these
standards shall not be permitted:
         (a)   Artists, sculptors, photographers, home crafts;
         (b)   Authors, composers, musicians;
         (c)   Clerical and other similar business services;
         (d)   Dressmaking, tailoring;
         (e)   Child day, as regulated by state law, and limited to no more
than six nonresident children at any time;
         (f)   Instruction in music, dance or the like, provided there are no
more than two students at a time;
         (g)   The office of a professional accountant, attorney, consultant,
insurance agent, architect, engineer, or the like, provided that they are
restricted to number and traffic flows of client vehicles as hereinafter
outlined; and
         (h)   Machine shops, provided the facility is in an accessory
building, meeting all pertinent regulations, and such facility is no closer
than 100 feet to any other residential dwellings.
      (3)   Number of employees. Not more than one person other than a member
of the resident family shall be employed in home occupations.
      (4)   Area restrictions. The home occupation shall be clearly incidental
and subordinate to the home’s use for residential purposes and therefore can
occupy no more than 25% of the total floor area of the principal structure.
      (5)   Use of accessory buildings. Except, as provided in division (A)
above, no accessory buildings shall be used for the conduct of a home
occupation.
      (6)   Exterior evidence of business. Nothing shall be done to the
exterior of the building to indicate the existence of a home occupation. Except
for outdoor play space for childcare and a non-illuminated sign showing only
the address and name of the home occupation. Said sign can be no larger than
1.5 square feet and must be wall mounted at the entrance door. Plan Commission
Staff must approve color scheme. The following activities are expressly
prohibited:
         (a)   Structural modifications such as separate entrances, color,
materials, or the construction of accessory structures not customarily
residential in nature;
         (b)   Exterior storage of goods, equipment, materials;
         (c)   The emission of glare, noises, sounds, odors, or vibrations;
and/or
         (d)   There shall be no interference with radio or television
receivers caused by the operating of electrical or mechanical equipment.
      (7)   Traffic.
         (a)   Employee parking shall be located off-street. All front, side
and rear yard requirements shall be maintained;
         (b)   The home occupation shall not reduce or render unusable areas
provided for required off-street parking for the dwelling unit;
         (c)   Traffic generated by a home occupation shall not exceed the
average daily volume normally expected for a residence in a residential
neighborhood, which for the purposes of this section means up to ten round
trips per day.

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish specific
regulations for the design and development of mobile home parks. Mobile home
parks, per §

regulations. They shall also comply with any applicable federal and state laws.
   (B)   Design and construction standards. All mobile home parks shall adhere
to the provisions of
Chapter 153, the Subdivision Code, regarding public streets, sidewalks and
underground utilities.
      (1)   Each park shall have a total land area of no less than 10 acres.
      (2)   Individual mobile home lots shall be no less than 3,000 square feet
in area and have minimum dimensions of 30 feet wide by 100 feet deep.
      (3)   Each mobile home lot shall have two parking spaces, one of which
may be located off the lot but within 200 feet of the lot it serves.
      (4)   Each mobile home shall be no closer than 30 feet to the street
right-of-way.
      (5)   Each mobile home lot shall be equipped with a concrete slab of
adequate thickness and size to support the mobile home during all seasons.
      (6)   Permitted accessory buildings and uses shall be limited to
management offices, laundry facilities, recreational areas, and individual
storage sheds.
      (7)   Each mobile home park shall be adequately lighted for safety at
night.
      (8)   No mobile home lot, parking area, recreational area or accessory
building or use shall be closer than 50 feet to any adjoining residential
property or external public street.
      (9)   A single ground mounted sign shall be permitted provided that it
adheres to the provisions of §
154.40(D)(3).
    (10)   Landscaping, buffering, and screening provisions shall comply with §
154.39.

Common facilities not dedicated to the public shall be operated and maintained
at no expense to any governmental unit.
      (2)   All private streets shall be maintained by the aforesaid private

benches, pews, or other such seating facilities, each 20 inches of such seating
facilities shall be counted as one seat.
      (3)   The parking space requirement for a use not specifically mentioned
herein shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature.
      (4)   In the cases of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal
the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
   (E)   Off-street loading requirements.
      (1)   In any district in connection with any building or part thereof
hereafter erected or altered, which is to be occupied by industrial,
warehousing, wholesale commercial, retail commercial, service or other uses

rear requirements for the adjacent lots in the separate districts shall be the
same for both lots on their common line or lines and shall be those of the more
restrictive district.
   (E)   In any district on any corner lot, no fence, structure, or decorative
planting shall be erected or planted within 30 feet of the intersection of the
street right-of-way lines if, in the opinion of the designated staff, the
fence, structure, or decorative planting creates a hazard by obstructing
visibility of traffic.

less intensive nature. This section shall apply to all parking lots, ground
mounted signs, when the terrain permits, multi family developments and
nonresidential uses, be they principally permitted uses or conditionally
permitted uses.

      (1)   Where the purpose of this section can be effectively accomplished,
native vegetation shall be used;
      (2)   The applicable governmental body having jurisdiction thereover may
require any applicant to retain a consultant, such as landscape architects, to
insure that proposed vegetation, landscaping, buffering, or screening materials
shall provide the degree and quality that is determined to be necessary, given

§ 154.41A WIRELESS AND CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose and legislative intent. The Telecommunications Act of 1996
affirmed the city authority concerning the placement, construction and
modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The Advisory Plan
Commission of the city finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may
pose a unique hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of
the city and its inhabitants. The city also recognizes that facilitating the
development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset
to the city and of significant benefit to the city and its residents. In order
to insure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities is consistent with the city’s land use policies,
the city is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications
facilities application and permit process. The intent of this section is to
minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications facilities,
establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications,
assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such
facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city.

or the proscribed Application thereof; shall be severable, and the remaining
provisions of this chapter, and all applications thereof; not having been
declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in fall force and
effect.
      (2)   Any conditionally permitted use issued under this chapter shall be
comprehensive and not severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be

§ 155.038 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS AND MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The construction requirements and material specifications shall conform to
the latest edition of Indiana Department of Transportation and Construction and
Material Specifications in addition to the following:
   (A)   Trench excavation.
      (1)   Open no more trench in advance of pipe laying than is necessary to
expedite the work. Excavate trenches to a width that will provide adequate
working space, but not more than the maximum design width. Do not undercut
trench wall. Excavate trenches below the pipe invert a sufficient distance to
provide space for the pipe bedding carry trenches in ledge rock, compact rocky
or gravelly soil, or other unyielding materials below the bottom of the pipe at
least one-fourth of the outside diameter at the pipe or six inches, whichever
is greater. Refill the space beneath the pipe with bedding material as
specified for first class bedding.
      (2)   Excavate pipe bell holes at each joint to provide full-length
barrel support of the pipe and to prevent point loading at the bells or
couplings.
      (3)   Unless trench banks above the top of the pipe are cut back on a
stable slope, sheet and brace trenches as necessary to prevent saving or
sliding to provide protection for workmen and the pipe and to protect adjacent
structures and facilities. Do not remove trench sheeting unless the pipe
strength is sufficient to support the external loads, including the weight of a
prism of earth above the top of the pipe with trench width measured to the bank
of the sheeting. Do not brace sheeting against pipe; knit brace it so that no
concentrated loads or horizontal thrusts are transmitted to the pipes.
      (4)   In all cases over five feet in depth, trenches must be braced, or
an acceptable cage inserted, or the ditch must be laid back to the angle of
repose to protect the people working in the excavation. In existing street
rights-of-way, permission must be obtained front the City Engineer to lay back
the slopes in a public right-of-way
   (B)   Pipe bedding.
      (1)   Standard pipe bedding shall be first class bedding. The pipe shall
be bedded in crushed stone or rounded gravel-bedding material placed on the
trench bottom. The bedding material shall have 95% passing a 3/4-inch sieve and
95% retained in a No. 4 sieve. The bedding shall have a minimum thickness
beneath the pipe of six inches or one-fourth of the outside diameter of the
pipe, whichever is greater, and shall extend up the sides of the pipe to the
horizontal centerline. Backfill from pipe horizontal centerline to a level not
less than 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be of the bedding material.
Hand placed backfill shall be finely divided materials free from debris,
organic material and stones.
      (2)   Carefully prepare bedding so that the pipe, after installation,
will be true to line and grade. Surface grade will material or trench subgrade
beneath the pipe to provide a uniform and continuous support beneath the pipe
at all points between bell holes or pipe joints with approved bedding material
beneath the pipe. After each pipe has been brought to grade, aligned, and
placed in final position, deposit and densify sufficient bedding material under
the haunches and on each side of the pipe to hold the pipe in proper position
during subsequent pipe jointing, bedding and backfilling operations. Deposit
bedding material uniformly and simultaneously on each side of the pipe to
prevent lateral displacement.
      (3)   Place pipe that is to be bedded on a concrete cradle or encased in
concrete in proper position on temporary supports consisting of pre-shaped wood
blocks or bricks with wood edges when necessary, rigidly anchor or weight the
pipe to prevent floatation when the concrete is placed.
      (4)   Place concrete for cradles, arches, or encasement uniformly on each
side of the pipe and deposit at approximately its final position. Do not move
concrete more than five feet from its point of deposit. Concrete placed beneath
the pipe shall be sufficiently workable so that the entire space beneath the
pipe can be filled without excessive vibration.
   (C)   Pipe laying.
      (1)   Grade stakes shall be required prior to laying any pipeline and
either laser alignment or batter boards shall control grade.
      (2)   Protect pipe during handling against impact, shock, and free fall.
Do not permit hooks to come in contact with pre-molded joint surfaces. Handle
pipe having premolded joint rings or attached couplings so that no weight,
including the weight of the pipe itself, will bear on or be supported by the
jointing material. Take care to avoid dragging the spigot ring on the ground or
allowing it to be damaged by contact with gravel, crushed stone, or other hard
objects. After delivery alongside the trench, carefully examine each piece of
pipe for roundness and specification compliance. Acceptable pipe may be marked
with paint or other permanent marking material, so that the marks are plainly
visible after installation in the trench and before the pipe is covered. Clean
joint contact surfaces immediately prior to jointing. Use lubricants, primers,
or adhesives as recommended by the pipe or joint manufacturer. Unless otherwise
required, lay all pipe straight between changes in alignment and at uniform
trade between changes in trade. Excavate bell holes for each pipe joint. When
jointed in the trench the pipe shall form a true and smooth line. Keep trenches
dry during pipe laying. Divert surface water from the trench area to the
greatest extent practicable without causing damage to the adjacent property.
Before pipe laying is started, remove all water that may have entered the
trench. Whenever practicable start pipe laying at the lowest point and install
the pipe so that the spigot ends point in the direction of flow.
   (D)   Joints. In all jointing operations, the trench shall be dry. Before
making pipe joints, all surfaces of the pipe shall be clean and dry.
Lubricants, primers, adhesives, and other joint preparation material shall be
used as recommended by the pipe or joint manufacturer’s specifications. One or
more of the following joints may be used:
      (1)   Compression joints. Compression joints shall conform to ASTM
specifications C443 for concrete pipe and ASTM 0425 for vitrified clay pipe.
      (2)   Bituminous joints, mastic type. After the tongue and groove or bell
and spigot have been brushed and wiped clean and dry, and before the pipe is
placed in position, both tongue and groove or bell and spigot shall be coated
with bituminous plastic cement. The bituminous plastic cement shall be used in
sufficient quantity to completely fill the joint when the pipe is placed in
final position. After the pipe has been placed in position and is set to its
true alignment and grade and blocked, all surplus bituminous plastic cement
within the pipe shall be removed and the joints painted or wiped. The joints on
the outside of the pipe shall be completely filled and beveled from bell to
barrel on bell and spigot pipes.
      (3)   Coupling bands for corrugated steel pipe. Unless otherwise
specified, field joints shall be made with bands. Bands shall be at least 0.064
inches in thickness and at least 10 1/2 inches wide. Band sheets shall be made
from the same base metal as the pipe and shall have the same coating. Bands
shall have two corrugations 7 5/8 inches center to center to conform to the
inner corrugations of the rerolled ends of the pipe. Bands 12 inches through 42
inches in diameter shall be one-piece bands, greater than 42 inches diameter
shall be two piece. Bands shall be secured with a bar, bolt, and strap
connector.
   (E)   Backfilling trenches.
      (1)   Unless other protection work is directed, backfill trenches
immediately after the pipe is laid. In the case of concrete cradle bedding,
delay backfilling until the concrete has set sufficiently to support the
backfill load. Except for unusual circumstances (such as sub-aqueous
installation) permit no water to rise in un-backfilled trenches after the pipe
is in place. Backfill material to be placed above pipe bedding shall be free of
brush, debris and junk. Unless specifically authorized, place no brick or rock
excavation or other detritus material in the upper 18 inches of the trench.
Place no rock or stones having a dimension larger than six inches within three
feet of the top of the pipe. Large stones may be placed in the remainder of the
trench backfill only if well separated and arranged so that no interference
with backfill settlement will result. Use pounding, jetting, or water flooding
for consolidating backfill material only when approved by the City Engineer,
particularly prone to water damage are sewers laid in heavy clay soils or
during cold winter months. Water flooding or jetting in porous sand or gravel
during warm periods may be recommended. In general, limit the addition of water
during backfill to provide optimum moisture content for tamping procedure.
      (2)   All backfill for storm sewers, sanitary sewers or water mains in
roadway areas or that will be under curbs, or within five feet of pavement or
curb, shall be made with approved granular material. In all other areas the
backfill material may consist of on-site material but the pipe must be covered
with tamped bedding material to a depth of one foot over the highest point of
the pipe.
   (F)   Headwalls.
      (1)   Unless waived in writing by the City Engineer, concrete with steel
reinforced headwalls are required on all stormwater pipe outlets. As a minimum,
a half headwall is required. A full headwall is required to stabilize grade
slopes. The top of a full headwall shall be parallel to final grade.
      (2)   Full headwalls are required on both the inlet and outlet of
stormwater pipes under driveways and other roadways which expose the pipe to
possible crushing by vehicle traffic.
   (G)   Pipe material specification.
      (1)   Corrugated metal. All corrugated metal pipe shall be aluminum
coated, welded seam and conform to INDOT (only permitted with city approval and
located outside of pavement or sidewalks).
      (2)   Concrete pipe. Unless waived by the City Engineer, all storm pipe
under a public roadway 24 inches in diameter or less shall be concrete pipe
with steel reinforcement and conform to INDOT.
      (3)   PVC pipe. PVC pipe may be used upon approval of the City Engineer.
PVC may not be used under roadway, parking, or another paved area. PVC pipe
shall be the highest quality, high strength. PVC pipe such as A-2000 corrugated
PVC pipe or approved equivalent approved by the city.
      (4)   HDPE pipe. HPPE liner pipe shall be used in accordance with current
INDOT specifications, AASHTO M252 and M294 and ASMR 2306.
   (H)   Other requirements. All easements shall be acquired and recorded. A
recorded copy of the easements shall be submitted with the as-built drawing.
   (I)   As-built. At the completion of construction, the contractor shall
supply the city with an as-built survey. This plan shall show all improvements

ACI N301
and 305.1 and as follows:
         (a)   Maintain concrete temperatures below 85°F at time of placement.
         (b)   Fog spray forms, steel reinforcement and subgrade just before
placing concrete. Keep subgrade uniformly moist without standing water, soft
spots or dry areas.
      (2)   Cold weather placement. Comply with ACI 306.1 and as follows:
         (a)   Protect concrete work from physical damage or reduced strength
that could be caused by frost, freezing actions or low temperatures as soon as
achievable, without causing damage to the desired finish.
            1.   When average high and low temperature is expected to fall
below 40°F for three consecutive days.
            2.   Do not use frozen materials or materials containing ice or
snow. Do not place concrete on frozen subgrade or subgrade containing frozen
materials.
            3.   Do not use calcium chloride, salt or other materials
containing antifreeze agents or chemical accelerators unless otherwise
specified and approved in the mix design.
   (B)   Ensure reinforcements, inserts, embedded parts and formed joints are
not disturbed during concrete placement.
   (C)   Place concrete in uniform layers, horizontal, six to eight inches
thick. Place concrete continuously between predetermined construction joints
shown on drawings (if called for). Piling up of concrete in forms to cause
separation or loss of ingredients is not permitted.
   (D)   Do not deposit concrete which has partially set or hardened. Remove
hardened or partially hardened concrete which has accumulated on forms or
reinforcement. Do not place concrete on previously deposited concrete which has
hardened sufficiently to cause formation of seams or planes of weakness within
respective member or section except as specified.
   (E)   Deposit concrete as nearly in final position as practical to avoid
rehandling. Exercise care to prevent splashing forms or reinforcing with
concrete. Do not permit concrete to drop freely a distance greater than three
feet. Where longer drops are necessary, use chute, tremie, or other conveyance
to help avoid separation.
   (F)   Do not deposit concrete into excavation where water is standing. If
place of deposit cannot be successfully pumped dry, place through tremie with
outlet end near bottom of place of deposit.
   (G)   Do not deposit concrete when plasticity, measured by slump test, is
outside specified limits. The addition of water to increase slump will not be
permitted.
   (H)   Vibration. As soon as concrete is deposited, thoroughly agitated with
mechanical vibrators and suitable hand tools to work mixture into corners of
forms and around reinforcing and embedded items. Use mechanical vibrators with
minimum frequency of 9,000 revolutions/minute. Do not over vibrate or use
vibrators to transport concrete within forms. Insert and withdraw vibrators at
approximately 18 inches apart. At each insertion, vibrate generally five to 15
seconds, sufficient to consolidate concrete but not long enough to cause
segregation. Keep spare vibrator on job site during concrete placement
operations. Do not insert vibrator into lower courses that have begun to set.
   (I)   Excessive honeycomb or embedded debris in concrete is not acceptable.
   (J)   Concrete shall be placed within 90 minutes of batching. If ambient air
temperatures are above 80°F, the batch time shall be lowered to 75 minutes.

      (5)   If using forms for curing, keep forms in contact with concrete wet
during curing period unless type of form is impervious to water, such as metal
or fiberglass.
      (6)   If forms are removed before curing period is complete, continue
curing immediately with other approved methods.
   (B)   Method of curing.
      (1)   Impervious sheet cure. Wet exposed surfaces of concrete after
completing finishing and then apply pre-wetted sheet with edges lapped six
inches minimum and sealed and secured in such manner as to prevent moisture
from escaping from concrete from laps or edges. Remove sheet after seven- day
curing period.
      (2)   Curing compound.
         (a)   Apply curing compounds by spraying or rolling uniformly in a
single coat on surfaces immediately following final finishing operation.
         (b)   Apply curing compound in accordance with manufacturer’s
recommendations.

2 inch in height. Leave surfaces with texture imparted by forms.
         (b)   Apply on concrete surfaces not exposed to public view and where
noted on drawings.
      (2)   Smooth-form finish.
         (a)   Patch tie holes and defects. Remove exposed fins exceeding 1/
8 inch in height.
         (b)   Apply on concrete surfaces exposed to public view and where
noted on drawings.
   (B)   Initial finishing.
      (1)   Re-straighten surface irregularities with a ten-foot highway screed
in two directions as close to perpendicular as possible before water appears on
concrete surface.
      (2)   Do no further working of surface until time for floating; do not
work surface while water is present.
   (C)   Floating.
      (1)   Begin float operations when bleed water sheen has disappeared and
concrete has stiffened sufficiently to allow walking on surface without leaving
heel prints more than 1/4 inch deep. Check and level the surface lane to an
initial tolerance not exceeding 1/4 inch in ten feet when tested with a ten
foot straight edge. Immediately after leveling, refloat surface to a uniform
smooth granular surface.
      (2)   Avoid premature finishing that brings excessive fines to surface
causing finished slab to have soft surface which could eventually make the
surface weak and possibly spaul and flake.
   (D)   Troweling.
      (1)   Delay trowling as long as possible to prevent working excess fines
and water to surface. Do not begin until surface moisture film and shine
remaining after floating have disappeared. Trowel in alternate pass directions.

(Ord. 20-2011, passed 11-16-11)
§ 157.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificates of Appropriateness required. A Certificate of
Appropriateness must be issued by or on behalf of the Commission before a
permit is issued for, or work is begun on, any of the following, within all
areas of a historic district:
      (1)   The demolition of any building;
      (2)   The moving of any building;
      (3)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color change; or
      (4)   Any new construction of a principal building or accessory building
or structure subject to view from a public street or road.
   (B)   Application for Certificates of Appropriateness. Application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made in the office of the Commission on
forms provided by that office. Detailed drawings, plans, or specifications are
not required. However, to the extent reasonably required for the Commission to
make a decision, each application must be accompanied by sketches, drawings,
photographs, descriptions, or other information showing the proposed exterior
alterations, additions, changes, or new construction.
   (C)   Approval or denial of Certificate of Appropriateness. The Commission
may advise and make recommendations to the applicant before acting on an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness. If an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness is approved by the Commission, or is not acted
on by the Commission within 30 days after it is filed, a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be issued. If the certificate is issued, the application
shall be processed in the same manner as applications for building or
demolition permits required by the city, if any are processed. If no building
or demolition permits are required, the applicant may proceed with the work
authorized by the certificate. If the Commission denies an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness within 30 days after it is filed, the
certificate may not be issued. The Commission must state its reasons for the
denial in writing, and must advise the applicant. An application that has been
denied may not be processed as an application for a building or demolition
permit and does not authorize any work by the applicant. The Commission may
grant an extension of the 30 day limit if the applicant agrees to it.
   (D)   Criteria for considering effect of actions on historic buildings. The
Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any reconstruction,
alteration, maintenance, or moving of a historic building or any part of or
appurtenance to such building, including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps,
paving, and signs shall require that such work be done in a manner that will
preserve the historical and architectural character of the building, structure,
or appurtenance. In considering historic and architectural character, the
Commission shall consider, among other things, the following:
      (1)   Purposes of this chapter;
      (2)   Historical and architectural value and significance of the
building, structure, site, or appurtenance;
      (3)   Compatibility and significance of additions, alterations, details,
materials, or other non-original elements which may be of a different style and
construction date than the original;
      (4)   The texture, material, color, style, and detailing of the building,
structure, site, or appurtenance;
      (5)   The continued preservation and protection of original or otherwise
significant structure, material, and ornamentation;
      (6)   The relationship of buildings, structures, appurtenances, or
architectural features similar to one within the same historic district,
including for primary areas, visual compatibility, as defined in §
157.09(B) of this code; and
      (7)   The position of the building or structure in relation to the
street, public right-of-way and to other buildings and structures.
   (E)   Procedure for demolition upon denial of a Certificate of
Appropriateness. The purpose of this division is to preserve historic buildings
that are important to the education, culture, traditions, and economic values
of the city, and to afford the city, historical organizations, and other
interested persons the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the
preservation of these buildings. If a property owner demonstrates that a
historic building is incapable of earning an economic return on its value, as
appraised by a qualified real estate appraiser, and the Commission fails to
approve the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the building may be
demolished. However, before a demolition permit is issued or demolition
proceeds, the following requirements for notice must be met:
      (1)   Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed
by the Commission, based on the Commission's classification on the approved
map, but not less than 60 days nor more than one year.
      (2)   Notice must be posted on the premises of the building proposed for
demolition in a location clearly visible from the street.
      (3)   Notice must be published in a newspaper of general local
circulation at least three times before demolition, with the first publication
not more than 15 days after the application for a permit to demolish is filed,
and the final publication at least 15 days before the date of the permit.
The Commission may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness at any time during
the notice period under this division. If the Certificate of Appropriateness is
approved, a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay, and
demolition may proceed.

§ 157.08 STAFF APPROVALS.
   (A)   The staff of the Commission is authorized to grant or deny a
Certificate of Appropriateness in all cases except for items listed in division
(B).
   (B)   The staff may not grant or deny a Certificate of Appropriateness for
the following:
      (1)   The demolition of a building;
      (2)   The moving of a building;
      (3)   The construction of an addition to a building; or
      (4)   The construction of a new building.

§ 157.09 VISUAL COMPATIBILITY.
   (A)   For new construction, contemporary design and non-historic buildings.
To preserve and encourage the integrity of historic buildings, structures,
sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods and to ensure their
compatibility with any new work; the construction of a new building or
structure, and the moving, reconstruction, alteration, major maintenance, or
repair involving a color change conspicuously affecting the external appearance
of any non-historic building, structure, or appurtenance within the primary
area of a historic district within the historic district must be generally of a
design, form, proportion, mass, configuration, building material, texture,
color, and location on a lot compatible with other buildings in the historic
district, particularly with buildings designated as historic, and with squares
and places to which it is visually related.
   (B)   Criteria for considering visual compatibility. Within the historic
district, new buildings as well as buildings, structures, and appurtenances
that are moved, reconstructed, materially altered, repaired, or changed in
color, must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which
they are visually related generally in terms of the following visual
compatibility factors:
      (1)   Height. The height of proposed buildings must be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
      (2)   Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the
width of a building to the height of the front elevation must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (3)   Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of the windows to the height of the windows in a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related.
      (4)   Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of
solids to voids in the front facade of a building must be visually compatible
with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (5)   Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of a
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (6)   Rhythm of entrances and porch projections. The relationship of
entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks must be visually
compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.
      (7)   Relationship of materials, texture, and color. The relationship of
the materials, texture, and color of the facade of a building must be visually
compatible with the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is
visually related.
      (8)   Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building must be visually
compatible with the buildings to which it is visually related.
      (9)   Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building such as walls,
wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape masses, and building facades, must
form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if necessary to ensure
visual compatibility of the building to the buildings, squares, and places to
which it is visually related.
      (10)   Scale of building. The size of a building and the building mass of
a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches, and
balconies must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to
which it is visually related.
      (11)   Directional expression of front elevation. A building must be
visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related in its directional character, including vertical character, horizontal
character, or non-directional character.

§ 157.10 PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER UPON ALTERATION
OR RELOCATION.
   (A)   A historic building or structure or any part of or appurtenance to
such building or structure, including stone walls, fences, light fixtures,
steps, paving, and signs may be moved, reconstructed, altered, or maintained
only in a manner that will preserve the historical and architectural character
of the building, structure, or appurtenance.
   (B)   A historic building may be relocated to another site only if it is
shown that preservation on its current site is inconsistent with division (A).

   (A)   Maintenance; retention of character. Historic buildings shall be
maintained to meet the applicable requirements established under state statute
for buildings generally so as to prevent the loss of historic material and the
deterioration of important character defining details and features.
   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the ordinary repairs and maintenance of any historic
building, provided that such repairs or maintenance do not result in a
conspicuous change in the design, form, proportion, mass, configuration,
building material, texture, color, location, or external visual appearance of
any structure, or part thereof.

§ 159.01 GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Authority and title. 
      (1)   This chapter is required in accordance with statutory authority
granted to City of Lawrenceburg under "Home Rule" (I.C. § 36-1-3) and further
is required by Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Stormwater program (40 CFR Parts 9, 122, 123, and 124; December 8, 1999)
authorized by the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management's (IDEM) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) General Permit (MS4 GP), and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management's Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP). Based
on this authority and these requirements, this chapter regulates:
         (a)   Discharges of prohibited non-stormwater flows into the storm
drain system;
         (b)   Stormwater drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate boundaries of the City of Lawrenceburg;
         (c)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land;
         (d)   Stormwater, including stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and
surface runoff and drainage, associated with construction activity;
         (e)   Stormwater discharges from construction support activities
directly related to construction sites subject to this chapter;
         (f)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction and grading of lots and other parcels of land;
         (g)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems;
         (h)   The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater quality
facilities and systems;
         (i)   The design, construction, and maintenance of new dams;
         (j)   The development downstream of existing dams; and
         (k)   Development within floodplains, floodways, fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and bluff zones.
      (2)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of
Lawrenceburg Stormwater Management Chapter. Once adopted, this chapter will
supersede any conflicting ordinances previously adopted by the City of
Lawrenceburg.
      (3)   This chapter shall apply to any development or construction plan
that is submitted to the City of Lawrenceburg for permit after the date of
passage. Any plans submitted to any department prior to the passing of this
chapter shall be subject to all previously approved ordinances and regulations
in existence at time of filling.
   (B)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   This chapter shall regulate all development and redevelopment
occurring within the City of Lawrenceburg. No building permit shall be issued,
and no land disturbance started for any construction in a development, as
defined in §
159.08, until the plans required by this chapter for such construction have
been accepted in writing by the City of Lawrenceburg. With the exception of the
requirements of §§
159.02 and
159.06(D), single-family dwelling houses and duplexes in accepted subdivisions,
and land-disturbing activities affecting less than one acre of area shall be
exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Also exempt from this chapter
shall be agricultural land-disturbing activities unless specific to illicit
discharges, dumping, or related.
      (2)   In addition to the requirements of this chapter and its companion
Stormwater Standards Design Guide, compliance with all applicable ordinances of
City of Lawrenceburg as well as with applicable federal, State of Indiana, and
other local statutes and regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise
stated, all other specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most
recent edition available. The City of Lawrenceburg capital improvement projects
shall be exempt from obtaining a permit but are expected to meet all applicable
technical requirements of this chapter and the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater
Standards Design Guide. In case of conflicts between the requirements contained
in this chapter and requirements contained in other regulations, the more
restrictive shall prevail.
      (3)   Any construction project which has had its final drainage plan
accepted by the City of Lawrenceburg within a two-year period prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be exempt from all requirements of this
chapter that are in excess of the requirements of ordinances in effect at the
time of acceptance. Such an exemption is not applicable to the requirements
detailed in §
159.02.
      (4)   The City of Lawrenceburg Board of Zoning Appeals has the authority
to increase, modify, grant exemptions, and/or waive certain requirements of
this chapter and its associated technical standards document when supported by
sound engineering community planning practices. A pre-submittal meeting with
the City of Lawrenceburg may be requested by the applicant to discuss the
applicability of various provisions of the chapter and its associated technical
standards document with regards to unique or unusual circumstances relating to
a project. However, any initial determination of such applicability shall not
be binding on future determinations of the City of Lawrenceburg that may be
based on the review of more detailed information and plans.
   (C)   Findings. The City of Lawrenceburg finds that:
      (1)   Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within the
City of Lawrenceburg or its planning jurisdiction boundary are at times
subjected to flooding;
      (2)   Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is
also a danger to the natural resources of the region;
      (3)   Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, and
when not properly designed and built results in increased stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion,
adverse impacts to habitat and natural resources, and increased sediment
transport and deposition;
      (4)   Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site
and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs;
      (5)   Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments
and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development
projects within the City of Lawrenceburg will, absent reasonable regulation and
control, adversely affect the City of Lawrenceburg's water bodies and water
resources;
      (6)   Pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the City of
Lawrenceburg will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement,
adversely affect the City of Lawrenceburg's water bodies and water resources;
      (7)   Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and
illicit discharges can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of
stormwater management;
      (8)   Adopting and implementing the standards, criteria, and procedures
contained and referenced in this chapter will reduce deleterious effects of
stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; and
      (9)   Adopting this chapter is necessary for the preservation of the
public health, safety, and welfare, for the conservation of natural resources,
and for compliance with certain state and federal regulations.
   (D)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Lawrenceburg through
the regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm
drainage system and to protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development
of land and water resources within the City of Lawrenceburg. This chapter
establishes methods for managing the quantity and quality of stormwater
entering into the stormwater system associated with developments and illicit
discharges in order to comply with state and federal regulations. The
objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by
excessive stormwater runoff;
      (2)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm system from
construction site runoff;
      (3)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm system from
runoff from new development and re-development;
      (4)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the storm system; and
      (5)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter.
   (E)   Abbreviations and definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the
abbreviations and definitions provided in §
159.08 shall apply.
   (F)   Responsibility for administration. The City of Lawrenceburg shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted or duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement agency may be
delegated in writing by the City of Lawrenceburg to qualified persons or
entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the City of
Lawrenceburg.
   (G)   Interpretation. Words and phrases in this chapter shall be construed
according to their common and accepted meanings, except those words and phrases
defined in §
159.08. Technical words and technical phrases that are not defined in this
chapter, but which have acquired particular meanings in law or in technical
usage shall be construed according to such meanings and industry standards.
   (H)   Severability. The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared
severable, and if any court of competent jurisdiction should declare any part
or provision of this chapter invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall not affect any other part or provision of this chapter.
   (I)   Disclaimer of liability.
      (1)   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records,
engineering, and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or
stormwater runoff amounts may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land uses permitted will be free from stormwater
damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Lawrenceburg or any officer, representative, or employee thereof, for any
damage that may result from reliance on this chapter or on any administrative
decision lawfully made there under.
      (2)   The words "approve" and "accept", and their common derivations as
used in this chapter in relation to plans, reports, calculations, and permits
shall mean that City of Lawrenceburg has reviewed the material produced and
submitted by the applicant or his/her agents for general compliance with this
chapter and the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide, and
that such compliance would qualify the applicant to receive a stormwater
management approval or permit. Such an "approval" or "acceptance" is based on
the assumption that the design engineer has followed all appropriate
engineering methods in the design. Situations may arise where design and
construction practices must go beyond the requirements of these regulations in
order to adequately protect public safety and the environment. Any stormwater
quantity (volume or flow) or quality problems associated with the project
caused by poor construction and/or poor engineering design or judgment, either
on-site or off-site, are the responsibility of the developer and the design
engineer.
      (3)   Consideration, design, construction, and maintenance of safety
measures for proposed or existing stormwater facilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer, applicant, and/or the property owner. City of
Lawrenceburg and its officials and representatives shall not be responsible for
maintenance nor liable for any accidents.

§ 159.02 PROHIBITED DISCHARGES AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all discharges, including illegal
dumping, entering the storm drain system under the control of the City of
Lawrenceburg, regardless of whether the discharge originates from developed or
undeveloped lands, and regardless of whether the discharge is generated from an
active construction site or a stabilized site. These discharges include flows
from direct connections to the storm drain system, illegal dumping, and
contaminated runoff.
      (2)   Stormwater runoff from agricultural, timber harvesting, and mining
activities is exempted from the requirements of this section unless determined
to contain pollutants not associated with such activities or in excess of
standard practices. Farm residences are not included in this exemption.
      (3)   Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit,
waiver (unless the waiver is solely based on point source considerations, still
allowing non-point source discharge of a pollutant), or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for the subject discharge to the storm drain system, is also exempted
from this section.
   (B)   Prohibited discharges and connections.
      (1)   No person shall discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer
system (hereinafter referred to as "MS4") conveyance, watercourse, or
waterbody, directly or indirectly, any substance other than stormwater or an
exempted discharge. Any person discharging stormwater shall effectively
minimize pollutants from also being discharged with the stormwater, through the
use of best management practices (BMP's).
      (2)   Concrete washout material must be properly contained within an
appropriate practice and any waste material properly disposed of.
      (3)   The City of Lawrenceburg is authorized to require dischargers to
implement pollution prevention measures, utilizing BMP's necessary to prevent
or reduce the discharge of pollutants into the City of Lawrenceburg's
stormwater drainage system.
   (C)   Exempted discharges and connections.  Notwithstanding other
requirements in this chapter, the following categories of non-stormwater
discharges or flows are exempted from the requirements of this section:
      (1)   Water line and hydrant flushing for maintenance;
      (2)   Discharges from potable water sources;
      (3)   Discharges from emergency firefighting activities;
      (4)   Landscape irrigation and lawn watering;
      (5)   Diverted streamflows;
      (6)   Rising ground waters;
      (7)   Irrigation water;
      (8)   Springs;
      (9)   Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
      (10)   Naturally introduced detritus (e.g. leaves and twigs);
      (11)   Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration;
      (12)   Uncontaminated pumped ground water;
      (13)   Footing, foundation, and crawl space drains;
      (14)   Water from crawl space pumps;
      (15)   Uncontaminated condensate from air conditioning units, coolers,
and other compressors, and from outside storage of refrigerated gases or
liquids;
      (16)   Water from residential or non-commercial car washing by community
organizations used to wash vehicles and equipment, provided that there is no
discharge of soaps, solvents, or detergents used for such purposes;
      (17)   Dechlorinated/debromated residential swimming pool discharges not
including discharges from saltwater swimming pools;
      (18)   Excess uncontaminated storm sewer cleaning water not collected by
vacuum truck;
      (19)   Pavement wash water, provided spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred and where detergents are not used; and
      (20)   Routine external building washdown water that does not use
detergents.
   (D)   Storage of hazardous or toxic material. Storage or stockpiling of
hazardous or toxic material within any watercourse, or in its associated
floodway or floodplain, is strictly prohibited. Storage or stockpiling of
hazardous or toxic material, including sewage treatment plant stockpiles, on
active construction sites must include adequate protection and/or containment
to prevent any such materials from entering any temporary or permanent
stormwater conveyance or watercourse.
   (E)   Private property maintenance duties. Every person owning property
through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse located within their property boundaries,
free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly impede the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (F)   Spill reporting.
      (1)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a waterbody any
substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately
inform the City of Lawrenceburg concerning the discharge. A written report
concerning the discharge shall be filed with the City of Lawrenceburg and IDEM,
by the dischargers, within five days. The written report shall specify:
         (a)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;
         (b)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;
         (c)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge;
         (d)   All measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; and
         (e)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report,
and the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for
additional information on the matter, if a different person.
      (2)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this chapter against a
discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal
action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to
obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge
shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all
the requirements of this section. This requirement does not relieve discharger
from notifying other entities as required by state and/or federal regulations.
   (G)   Inspections and monitoring.
      (1)   Storm drainage system. The City of Lawrenceburg has the authority
to periodically inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the City
of Lawrenceburg's control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit
connections and discharges into the system. This inspection will include a
screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to
determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage
system. It could also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm
drainage system itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system
by means other than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet
runoff.
      (2)   Potential polluters. If, as a result of the storm drainage system
inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the City of
Lawrenceburg may inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater
runoff facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the City
of Lawrenceburg's properly identified representative to enter upon the premises
of the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or
sampling. The City of Lawrenceburg or its properly identified representative
may place on the discharger's property the equipment or devices used for such
sampling or inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be
subject to enforcement action as described in §
159.07.
      (3)   New development and re-development. Following the final completion
of construction and the receipt of as-built drawings by the City of
Lawrenceburg, the City of Lawrenceburg has the authority to inspect new
development and re-development sites to verify that all on-site stormwater
conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system are in compliance with
this section.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed 10-21-24)
§ 159.03 STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. The storage and controlled release of
excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all new business, institutional
developments, commercial and industrial developments, residential subdivisions,
planned development, rural estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other
new construction located within the City of Lawrenceburg. The City of
Lawrenceburg, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the
requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization.
Additional potential exemptions regarding the detention requirements are
provided under division (B).
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quantity management.
      (1)   It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving
the City of Lawrenceburg do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff as well as
compensation for loss of floodplain storage shall be required for all
developments and redevelopments (as defined in §
159.08) located within the City of Lawrenceburg. Release rate requirements,
downstream restriction considerations, acceptable outlet, adjoining property
impact considerations, policy on dams and levees, policy on fluvial erosion
hazard corridors, and compensatory floodplain storage rates are detailed in the
City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Technical Standards.
      (2)   Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the
associated proposed stormwater quantity management systems within a watershed,
it is the policy of the City of Lawrenceburg to discourage direct release of
runoff from a new development or redevelopment without providing detention.
However, in rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic
study or watershed plan of a major stream (not a "beat the peak" analysis)
adopted by the City of Lawrenceburg substantiates the benefits of (or allows
for) direct release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major
stream, the detention requirements set in this chapter may be waived. Other
special circumstances when such a waiver may be considered by City of
Lawrenceburg include situations where the design of a regional pond has already
taken into account the provision of direct release in certain areas in the
watershed.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications. The calculation
methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all stormwater facilities
shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the
City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide. The methods and
procedures in the Stormwater Standards Design Guide are consistent with the
policy stated above.
   (D)   Drainage easement requirements. All stormwater systems, including
detention or retention basins, conveyance systems, structures and
appurtenances, located outside of the right-of-way shall be placed within a
drainage easement. There shall be no trees or shrubs planted, nor any
structures or fences erected in any drainage easement, unless otherwise
accepted by City of Lawrenceburg. Additional easement requirements along
stormwater conveyance systems are contained in the City of Lawrenceburg
Stormwater Standards Design Guide. All drainage improvements performed relative
to the conveyance of stormwater runoff and the perpetual maintenance thereof,
within the latter easements, shall be the responsibility of the owner or
homeowner association.
   (E)   Placement of utilities. No utility company may disturb existing storm
drainage facilities without the consent of the City of Lawrenceburg staff,
whose decision may be appealed to the City of Lawrenceburg's body with
authority to grant appeals of the City of Lawrenceburg. All existing drainage
facilities shall have senior rights and damage to said facilities shall result
in penalties as prescribed in §
159.07.
   (F)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.
      (1)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the City
of Lawrenceburg and the commencement of construction activities, the City of
Lawrenceburg has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to
ensure full compliance with the provisions of this section, the Stormwater
Standards Design Guide, Design and Construction Standards, and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit.
      (2)   The City of Lawrenceburg also has the authority to perform long-
term, post-construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater
quantity facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available
storage capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements.
Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in
accordance with the designed and approved performance specifications for the
facilities, in addition to any prescribed operation and maintenance procedures,
and shall not be subsequently altered, revised, or replaced except as approved
by the City of Lawrenceburg. If deficiencies are found during the inspection,
the owner of the facility will be notified by the City of Lawrenceburg and will
be required to take all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the
owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as
specified in the notification letter, the City of Lawrenceburg will undertake
the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary.
      (3)   Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving
more than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to
property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body,
and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved.
      (4)   Stormwater conveyance facilities may be donated to the City of
Lawrenceburg or other unit of government designated by the City of
Lawrenceburg, for ownership and permanent maintenance, providing the City of
Lawrenceburg or other governmental unit is willing to accept responsibility.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed 10-21-24)
§ 159.04 STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. The City of Lawrenceburg will require a
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and
sediment control measures and materials handling procedures, to be submitted as
part of a project's construction plans and specifications. Any project located
within the corporate boundaries of the City of Lawrenceburg that includes
clearing, grading, excavation, or other land disturbing activities resulting in
the disturbance of one acre or more of total land area is subject to the
requirements of this section. This includes both new development and re-
development. This section also applies to disturbances of land that are part of
a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will
ultimately disturb one acre or more of total land area. Division (C) of this
section provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting
the coverage requirements of IDEM's CSGP shall also be in compliance with the
requirements contained in that permit.
      (1)   The requirements listed under this section do not apply to the
following activities:
         (a)   Agricultural land disturbing activities;
         (b)   Forest harvesting activities; and
         (c)   Stormwater discharges associated with oil and gas exploration,
production, processing and treatment operations, or transmission facilities
under 40 CFR 122.26.
      (2)   The requirements under this section also do not apply to the
following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain
provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion and sediment
control measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. § 14-34.
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (3)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one
acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent
letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the City of Lawrenceburg, and ensure
that a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is
completed and submitted in accordance with §
159.06, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site.
      (4)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than one acre, located
within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger
permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with the
terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger project
site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site must
include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots.
      (5)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the City of Lawrenceburg in accordance with §
159.06. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
compliance with this chapter during the construction activity and
implementation of the construction plan, and to notify the City of Lawrenceburg
upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site, requesting a
termination inspection to be performed by the City of Lawrenceburg. The City of
Lawrenceburg will then issue a notice of termination letter if the termination
inspection is sufficient. However, all persons engaging in construction and
land disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the
applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this section
and this chapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater pollution prevention.
      (1)   Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is
dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original
position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a
waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling.
      (2)   For land disturbance of one acre or more, the developer must submit
to the City of Lawrenceburg, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control
plans as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and
construction sequencing. The SWPPP and the project management log must be
retained for at least three years from the date the project permit is
terminated. For land disturbances totaling one acre or more, appropriate
erosion and sediment control measures that are consistent with the City of
Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide must be designed and shown on
the plans.
      (3)   The required IDEM general and implementation requirements that
apply to all land-disturbing activities are contained in the City of
Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.
      (1)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes
of determining applicability of this section to a project, the following
guidelines should be used:
         (a)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, offsite stockpiles, and other
utilities) to a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of
the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity
is under the control of the project site owner.
         (b)   Strip developments will be considered as one project site and
must comply with this section unless the total combined disturbance of all
individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan
of development or sale.
         (c)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
section, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common
areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined
by the following:
            1.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots
are one-half (0.5) acre or more, one-half (0.5) acre of land disturbance must
be used as the expected lot disturbance.
            2.   For a single-family residential project site where the lots
are less than one half (0.5) acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as
being disturbed.
            3.   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of project
sites, such as industrial and commercial projects, project sites, a minimum of
one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance,
unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which case the total lot
must be calculated as being disturbed.
      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement
of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall
meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual and the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards
Design Guide. The methods and procedures included in these two references are
in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of the IDEM's
CSGP. A copy of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained through
IDEM.
      (3)   The design requirements that would apply to all land-disturbing
activities and shall be considered in the selection, design, and implementation
of all stormwater quality and management measures contained in the SWPPP are
contained in the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
   (D)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.
      (1)   Following approval of the Stormwater Management Permit by the City
of Lawrenceburg and commencement of construction activities, the City of
Lawrenceburg has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure
full compliance with the provisions of this section, the approved Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan, the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design
Guide, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the terms and conditions of
the approved permit.
      (2)   A self-monitoring program (SMP) must be implemented by the project
site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working
effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the City of Lawrenceburg,
shall monitor and manage project construction and stormwater activities. The
trained individual shall perform a written evaluation of the project site:
         (a)   Twenty-four hours prior to a qualifying event or by the end of
the next business day following each measurable storm event.
         (b)   If there are no qualifying storm events within a given week, the
site should be monitored at least once in that week.
         (c)   In the event of multiple qualifying storm events during a work
week (Monday- Friday), no more than three inspections are required.
         (d)   A minimum of one time per month for specific areas within the
project area which are stabilized with permanent vegetation cover of at least
70% density and/or erosion resistant armoring is installed. Weekly monitoring
must resume if the vegetative cover fails, there is evidence of erosion in the
area, or IDEM/inspecting authority requires weekly monitoring to resume.
      (3)   A qualifying storm event is defined as precipitation accumulation
equal to, or greater than, one-half (0.50) inches of rainfall within a 24-hour
period. Self-monitoring inspections by the trained individual shall continue
until the entire site has been stabilized and a notice of termination letter
has been issued by the City of Lawrenceburg. Details regarding the required
monitoring activities are contained in the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater
Standards Design Guide.
      (4)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline
for stormwater quality but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for
implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project
site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this section,
all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff.
Recommendations by the trained individual for modified stormwater quality
measures should be implemented.
      (5)   A project management log must be maintained at the project site or
in the possession of on-site individuals associated with the management and
operations of the construction activities. The City of Lawrenceburg has the
right to request complete records of maintenance and monitoring activities
involving stormwater pollution prevention measures. All evaluation reports for
the project site must be made available to the City of Lawrenceburg, in an
organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request. Details regarding requirements
related to the project management log are contained in the City of Lawrenceburg
Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
(Ord. 2024-14, passed 10-21-24)
§ 159.05 STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. In addition to the requirements of §
159.04, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to
the City of Lawrenceburg as part of the Stormwater Management Permit
application, must also include post-construction stormwater quality measures.
These measures are incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and
are left in place following completion of construction activities to
continuously treat stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project
located within the corporate boundaries of the City of Lawrenceburg that
includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land disturbing activities,
resulting in the disturbance of one acre or more of total land area is subject
to the requirements of this section. This includes both new development and re-
development, and disturbances of land less than one acre of total land area
that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger
common plan will ultimately disturb one acre or more of total land area. In
addition, regardless of the amount of disturbance, the City of Lawrenceburg
reserves the right to require pre-treatment BMPs for proposed hot spot
developments in accordance with provisions contained in the City of
Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
      (1)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities:
         (a)   Construction activities associated with a single-family
residential dwelling disturbing less than one acre, when the dwelling is not
part of a larger common plan of development or sale;
         (b)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted project;
         (c)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or
         (d)   Forest harvesting activities.
      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the following
activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions
requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:
         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under
329 IAC 10.
         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. § 14-34.
         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste
pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.
      (3)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete
a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan
is completed and submitted to the City of Lawrenceburg in accordance with §
159.06. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure
proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMP's (especially, the
protection of post-stormwater BMPs during construction phase) in compliance
with this chapter and with the approved Stormwater Management Permit, and to
notify the City of Lawrenceburg upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site, requesting a termination inspection to be performed
by the City of Lawrenceburg. However, all eventual property owners of
stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements must
comply with the requirements of this section and this chapter.
   (B)   Policy on stormwater quality management.
      (1)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped
areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates,
increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as
fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts, and other pollutants. As new
development and re-development continues within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Lawrenceburg, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants
from stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers.
Through the use of appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs), to treat the
Water Quality Volume (WQv) or the Water Quality Flow (Qwq) stormwater runoff
will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants
will be removed.
      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the City of Lawrenceburg a
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that shows placement of
appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-approved list of BMP's specified in the City of
Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide. The SWPPP submittal shall
include an Operation and Maintenance Manual for all post-construction BMP(s)
included in the project and a notarized maintenance agreement, consistent with
the sample agreement provided in the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards
Design Guide, providing for the long-term maintenance of those BMPs, both of
which shall be recorded with the deed for the property on which the project is
located. The noted BMP(s) must be designed, constructed, and maintained
according to guidelines provided or referenced in the City of Lawrenceburg
Stormwater Standards Design Guide. Practices other than those specified in the
pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the burden of proof as to whether
the performance and ease of maintenance of such practices will be according to
guidelines provided in the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design
Guide, would be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and
criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMP's are provided in the City
of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
      (3)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate
practices (as noted under "Hot Spots" provision in the Stormwater Standards
Design Guide) to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and

   (G)   Required assurances. This section shall apply to all projects whether
the stormwater management system or portions thereof will be dedicated to the
City of Lawrenceburg or retained privately. As a condition of approval and
issuance of the permit, the City of Lawrenceburg shall require the applicant to
provide assurance in form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a bond when the
stormwater management plan has been accepted and before construction begins.
Said assurance will guarantee a good faith execution of the stormwater drainage
plan, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the stormwater quality
management plan, and any permit conditions. The assurance shall be for an
amount equal to 125% of the total costs of all stormwater management measures
for the entire project. The above-mentioned costs shall be based on an estimate
as prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor. Said costs shall be for
the installation and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of erosion control
measures and the construction and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of storm
drainage infrastructure, detention/retention facilities, and stormwater quality
BMP's, as regulated under this chapter, until the construction is completed,
the site is stabilized, and as-built plans are accepted by the City of
Lawrenceburg. Assurances shall be for a minimum of $5,000. All other
performance bonds, maintenance bonds or other assurances required by the City
of Lawrenceburg in accordance with any and all other ordinances shall also
apply and so be required. Local governmental jurisdictions may require
additional performance and/or maintenance assurances. The intent of this
assurance is not only to complete the installation of storm drain
infrastructure for the project, but also to assure that adequate stormwater
pollution prevention measures are properly installed and maintained. If
adequate assurances are set aside by the project site owner for the overall
project, proof of total assurance can be submitted in place of an individual
stormwater assurance.
   (H)   Terms and conditions of permits.
      (1)   In granting a Stormwater Management Permit, the City of
Lawrenceburg may impose such terms and conditions as are reasonably necessary
to meet the purposes of this chapter. The project site owner shall insure
compliance with such terms and conditions. Non-compliance with the terms and
conditions of permits will be subject to enforcement as described in §
159.07.
      (2)   The project site owner shall inform all general contractor,
construction management firms, grading or excavating contractors, utility
contractors, and the contractors that have primary oversight on individual
building lots of the terms and conditions of the Stormwater Management Permit
and the schedule for proposed implementation.
      (3)   In the event that a project site is determined to impact or
discharge to a sensitive area or is located in an impact drainage area, the
City of Lawrenceburg may require more stringent stormwater quantity and quality
measures than detailed in this chapter or in the Stormwater Standards Design
Guide.
         (a)   Determination of sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include highly
erodible soils, wetlands, karst areas, threatened or endangered species
habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters, and surface
drinking water sources. Any discharge from a stormwater practice that is a
Class V injection well shall meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards and
registered with US EPA as required by the IDEM. If wetlands are suspected on a
site, a wetland delineation should be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The need for
the applicant to check for the presence of threatened or endangered species
habitat will be determined on a case- by-case basis. Special terms and
conditions for development determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive
area shall be included in the Stormwater Management Permit.
         (b)   Determination of impact drainage areas. 
            1.   The following areas shall be designated as impact drainage
areas, unless good reason for not including them is presented to the City of

            2.   The City of Lawrenceburg or City of Lawrenceburg Engineer is
authorized, but is not required, to classify certain geographical areas as
impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage areas, the City of
Lawrenceburg may consider such factors as topography, soil type, capacity of
existing drains, and distance from adequate drainage facility.
            3.   Land that does not have an adequate outlet, taking into
consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be designated as an
impact drainage area by the City of Lawrenceburg. Special terms and conditions
for development within any impact drainage area shall be included in the
Stormwater Management Permit.
         (c)   Determination of designated drainage areas served by regional
facilities. The City of Lawrenceburg is authorized, but is not required, to
classify certain geographical areas as designated drainage areas that are or
will be served by regional facilities, such as a regional pond. In such cases,
an Infrastructure Development Fee (IDF) rate may be established for the
designated drainage area. The basis for determining such a fee for a proposed
development or re-development within a designated drainage area will be as
detailed in the City of Lawrenceburg Stormwater Standards Design Guide.
   (I)   Certification of as-built plans.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all projects whether the stormwater

and compliance, following the release of performance assurances, the property
owner, developer, or contractor shall be required to file a two-year
maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee with the City of Lawrenceburg in
an amount not to exceed 25% of the cost of the stormwater management system
located outside the public road rights-of-way, and in a form satisfactory to
the City of Lawrenceburg in order to assure that such stormwater system
installation was done according to:
         (a)   Standards of good workmanship;
         (b)   That the materials used in the construction and installation
were of good quality and construction;
         (c)   That such project was done in accordance with the accepted plans
and this chapter; and
         (d)   That any off-site drainage problems that may arise, whether
upstream or downstream of such project, will be corrected if such drainage
problems are determined by jurisdictional entity to have been caused by the
development of such project.
      (2)   The bond or other acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a
period of two years after the date of the release of required performance
assurances referenced in division (G) above. The beneficiary of all maintenance
bonds shall be the City of Lawrenceburg Council of the City of Lawrenceburg.

(Ord. 2024-14, passed 10-21-24)
§ 159.07 COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance with this chapter. To secure compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, violations thereof shall be subject to the
enforcement provisions set forth under division (B) below. Additionally,
compliance with the requirements set forth in the local zoning ordinances is
also necessary. Compliance with all applicable ordinances of the City of
Lawrenceburg as well as with applicable State of Indiana statues and
regulations shall also be required. Unless otherwise stated, all other
specifications referred to in this chapter shall be the most recent edition
available.
      (1)   Violation, compliance, offense.
         (a)   Violation. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions
of this chapter, the requirements of an approved stormwater management design
plan or permit, and/or the requirements of a recorded stormwater maintenance
agreement may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section.
Any such action or inaction is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated
by injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to and separate from the
imposition of any of the enforcement actions described below.
         (b)   Compliance. The act of correcting a violation or violations
within the time frame specified by the City of Lawrenceburg.
         (c)   Offense. Both a violation and a failure of compliance on a
particular project constitute an "offense." If there are multiple violations or
multiple failures of compliance on the same project, each shall be considered a
separate offense as further stated in division (B)(3).
      (2)   Warning notice. When the City of Lawrenceburg finds that any person
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any
order issued hereunder, the City of Lawrenceburg may serve upon that person a
written Warning Notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have
occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter
and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease.
Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the Warning Notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the Warning Notice. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the City of Lawrenceburg to take any
action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a Warning Notice.
   (B)   Enforcement of this chapter.
      (1)   Notice of violation/citation.
         (a)   If the City of Lawrenceburg determines that an applicant or
other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of
a permit, an approved stormwater management design plan, a recorded stormwater
management maintenance agreement, or the provisions of this chapter, it shall
issue a written Notice of Violation to such applicant or other responsible
person and the owner of the property. Where a person is engaged in activity
covered by this chapter without having first secured a permit therefore, the
notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in
charge of the activity being conducted on the site.
         (b)   The notice of violation can be in the form of a citation ticket
and/or a written letter that would contain detailed inspection findings,
conclusions of law, disposition of warning or fines assessed, stipulated
remedial actions as discussed with the responsible party representative,
reasonable deadlines for those remedial actions, and the date of re-inspection.
      (2)   Civil penalties for violations.
         (a)   Any person who commits an offense under this chapter commits a
civil infraction subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500 for each offense, plus
costs, damages, and expenses. Each day such violation occurs or continues
without a compliance action that is satisfactory to the City of Lawrenceburg
may be deemed a separate offense and shall make the violator liable for the
imposition of a fine for each day. The rights and remedies provided for in this
section are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law.
An admission or determination of responsibility shall not exempt the offender
from compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   Any person who aids or abets a person in a violation of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
         (c)   For the purposes of this section, "subsequent offense" means a
violation of the provisions of this chapter committed by the same person within
12 months of a previous violation of the same provision of this chapter for
which said person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be responsible.
         (d)   The City of Lawrenceburg has established an Enforcement Response
Schedule as noted in the table below that standardizes the approach that the
City of Lawrenceburg may, in its discretion, employ in dealing with stormwater
regulations offenses subject to this chapter and the associated Stormwater
Standards Design Guide. This Schedule shall apply separately to each offense in
the following manner: The first offense is the underlying violation itself,
while the subsequent offenses two through eight (as necessary) are failures of
compliance.
Offense# Type of Response Anticipated
Offense#    Type of Response Anticipated
1st offense Verbal Notice, Written Notice of Violation or Warning, and
            Administrative Penalty
2nd offense Notice of Violation, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
3rd offense Notice of Violation, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
4th offense Notice of Violation, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
5th offense Agreed Order, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
6th offense Administrative Order, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
7th offense Compliance Schedule, Administrative Penalty and/or Site Visit
8th offense Litigation and Administrative Penalty
 
         (e)   Likewise, in order to standardize the approach that the City of
Lawrenceburg may, in its discretion, employ in the imposition of administrative
penalties, the City of Lawrenceburg has established the following Schedule of
Administrative Penalties. Again, the penalty for the first offense would apply
to the violation itself, while the subsequent penalties two through four (as
necessary) would apply to failures of compliance. In its discretion, the City
of Lawrenceburg may impose penalties up to the amount specified in this
Schedule.
         (f)   The City of Lawrenceburg reserves the right to issue a maximum
penalty for any violation deemed sufficiently egregious or otherwise determined
by the City of Lawrenceburg to warrant a maximum penalty.

      (3)   Stop Work Order.
         (a)   In addition to the penalties listed above, if land disturbance
activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this chapter or accepted
final stormwater management plans, the City of Lawrenceburg may order the work
stopped by notice in writing served on any person engaged in the doing or
causing of such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such
work until authorized by the City of Lawrenceburg to proceed with the work. A
Stop Work Order will be posted on the site by the City of Lawrenceburg. It is
unlawful for any person to remove the notice or continue any work on the site
without permission from the City of Lawrenceburg.
         (b)   The City of Lawrenceburg may also undertake or cause to be
undertaken, any necessary or advisable protective measures to prevent
violations of this chapter or to avoid or reduce the effects of noncompliance
herewith. The cost of any such protective measures shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the property upon which the work is being done and the
responsibility of any person carrying out or participating in the work.
         (c)   For construction projects that are operating under a SWPPP
approved by the City of Lawrenceburg, if a Stop Work Order is issued on the
grounds that the erosion and sediment control measures included in the
construction plan are not adequate, the project site owner must be notified in
writing of the inadequacies in the erosion and sediment control measures and
the project site owner has 72 hours after receiving written notice to resolve
the identified inadequacies before the Stop Work Order can take effect.
         (d)   The 72 hour period to resolve identified inadequacies on a
construction project does not apply if the Stop Work Order is issued to a
construction project where the project site owner is creating a public health
hazard or safety hazard.
         (e)   Any person who neglects or fails to comply with a stop work
order shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
of not less than $1,000, and such person shall also pay the costs as may be
imposed in the discretion of the court. A permit reinstatement fee may also be
assessed by the City of Lawrenceburg.
      (4)   Withhold Certificate of Occupancy. The City of Lawrenceburg may
refuse to issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the building or other
improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant
or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the
notice of violation or has otherwise satisfied the requirements of this chapter
as determined by the City of Lawrenceburg.
      (5)   Suspension, revocation, or modification of permits.
         (a)   The City of Lawrenceburg may suspend, revoke, or modify any
existing permit that the violator may also have been previously granted by
notifying in writing the permit holder stating the reason for the suspension,
revocation, or modification. Permits may be revoked for:
            1.   Any substantial departure from the approved application plans
or specifications;
            2.   Refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or
local law; or
            3.   For false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
the permit.
         (b)   A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be reinstated after
the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set
forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations
described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon such conditions
as the City of Lawrenceburg may deem necessary to enable the applicant or other
responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such
violations.
      (6)   Suspension of access to the stormwater drainage system.
         (a)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
            1.   When the City of Lawrenceburg finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and
that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the City of Lawrenceburg may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to immediately comply with all ordinance
requirements and take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
            2.   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the City of Lawrenceburg may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons
or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water
supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
            3.   The City of Lawrenceburg may allow the person to recommence
its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of
Lawrenceburg that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further
termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this
chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the City of Lawrenceburg within five days of
receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the violator.
         (b)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
The City of Lawrenceburg may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drainage
system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state if the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of
Lawrenceburg may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the stormwater drainage system or waters of the state, or to minimize
danger to persons.
         (c)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the stormwater drainage system in violation of this chapter may
have their stormwater drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City of Lawrenceburg will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage system
access. The violator may petition the City of Lawrenceburg for a
reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates stormwater drainage system access to premises terminated pursuant to
this section, without the prior approval of the City of Lawrenceburg.
   (C)   Cost of abatement of the violation.
      (1)   In addition to any other remedies, should any owner fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, the City of Lawrenceburg may, after giving
notice and opportunity for compliance, have the necessary work done, and the
owner shall be required to reimburse the City of Lawrenceburg for all costs of
such work within 30 days after being notified of the costs in writing.
      (2)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Lawrenceburg
from taking such other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or remedy
any violation. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or
persons responsible. Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the
stormwater drainage system made necessary by the violation, as well as those
penalties levied by the EPA or IDEM for violation of the City of Lawrenceburg's
NPDES permit, administrative costs, attorney fees, court costs, and other costs
and expenses associated with the enforcement of this chapter, including
sampling and monitoring expenses.
         (3)   If the amount due for abatement of the violation is not paid
within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the City of
Lawrenceburg or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the
charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
   (D)   Appeals.
      (1)   Appeal of Notice of Violation. Any person to whom any provision of
this chapter has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days
after the action or decision being appealed from, to the appropriate board of
the City of Lawrenceburg the action or decision whereby any such provision was
so applied. Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis
for the appeal. The appropriate board of the City of Lawrenceburg shall
consider the appeal and make a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies
the action being appealed. In considering any such appeal, the appropriate
board of the City of Lawrenceburg may consider the recommendations of the City
of Lawrenceburg Staff and the comments of other persons having knowledge of the
matter. In considering any such appeal, the appropriate board may grant a
variance from the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part,
from the action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following
requirements are satisfied:
         (a)   The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with
the chapter;
         (b)   The granting of the relief requested will not substantially
prevent the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective
management of stormwater runoff; and
         (c)   Any person who has appealed a violation to the appropriate board
may appeal an adverse decision of the Board to the City of Lawrenceburg's
County court within 60 days of the Boards order, all pursuant to I.C. § 36-1-6-
9(e) and (f).
      (2)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within five days of the decision of the
appropriate board upholding the decision of the City of Lawrenceburg, then
representatives of the City of Lawrenceburg shall enter upon the subject
private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property, including the commencing of a
court action under I.C. § 34-28-5-1(b),to be read together with I.C. §§ 34-6-2-
86(1)(B) and 13-21-3-12(4), to enforce the order of the appropriate board. It
shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent, or person in possession of any
premises to refuse to allow the City of Lawrenceburg or its designee to enter
upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. Any costs associated with
the abatement shall be the responsibility of the owner of the premises. In the
event the owner of the premises fails to pay those costs within 30 days of
invoice, the City of Lawrenceburg shall impose a lien on the premises for the
unpaid amount.

      ERODIBILITY INDEX (EI).  The soil erodibility index (EI) provides a
numerical expression of the potential for a soil to erode considering the
physical and chemical properties of the soil and the climatic conditions where
it is located. The higher the index, the greater the investment needed to
maintain the sustainability of the soil resource base if intensively cropped.
It is defined to be the maximum of (RxKxLS)/T (from the Universal Soil Loss
Equation) and (CxI)/T (from the Wind Erosion Equation), where R is a measure of
rainfall and runoff, K is a factor of the susceptibility of the soil to water
erosion, LS is a measure of the combined effects of slope length and steepness,
C is a climatic characterization of windspeed and surface soil moisture and I
is a measure of the susceptibility of the soil to wind erosion. Erodibility
Index scores equal to or greater than eight are considered highly erodible
land.
      EROSION. The wearing away of the land surface by water, wind, ice,
gravity, or other geological agents. The following terms are used to describe
different types of water erosion:
         (a)   ACCELERATED EROSION. Erosion much more rapid than normal or
geologic erosion, primarily as a result of the activities of man.
         (b)   CHANNEL EROSION. An erosion process whereby the volume and
velocity of flow wears away the bed and/or banks of a well-defined channel.
         (c)   GULLY EROSION. An erosion process whereby runoff water
accumulates in narrow channels and, over relatively short periods, removes the
soil to considerable depths, ranging from one to two feet to as much as 75-
final feet.
         (d)   RILL EROSION. An erosion process in which numerous small
channels only several inches deep are formed; occurs mainly on recently
disturbed and exposed soils (see RILL).
         (e)   SPLASH EROSION. The spattering of small soil particles caused by
the impact of raindrops on wet soils; the loosened and spattered particles may
or may not be subsequently removed by surface runoff.
         (f)   SHEET EROSION. The gradual removal of a fairly uniform layer of
soil from the land surface by runoff water.
      EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL. A practice, or a combination of practices,
to minimize sedimentation by first reducing or eliminating erosion at the
source and then as necessary, trapping sediment to prevent it from being
discharged from or within a project site.
      FILTER STRIP. Usually a long, relatively narrow area (usually, 20 - 75
feet wide) of undisturbed or planted vegetation used near disturbed or
impervious surfaces to filter stormwater pollutants for the protection of
watercourses, reservoirs, or adjacent properties.
      FLOATABLE. Any solid waste that will float on the surface of the water.
      FLOOD (or FLOOD WATERS).  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual
and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
      FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining the channel which
have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory or 100-year flood. Any
normally dry land area that is susceptible to being inundated by water from any
natural source. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the floodway
fringe districts.
      FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
