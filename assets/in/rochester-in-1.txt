publication together with the affidavit of the printer or publisher shall be
obtained by the Clerk-Treasurer and attached to the original of each ordinance
adopted by the Common Council in the minute book of the Council. ('79 Code, §
1-7)
   (B)   Within a reasonable time after an ordinance of the Common Council is
adopted, the Clerk-Treasurer shall record it in a book kept for that purpose.
The record must include: the signature of the Mayor; the attestation of the
Clerk-Treasurer; the Mayor's approval or veto of the ordinance; if applicable,
a memorandum of the passage of the ordinance over the veto; and the date of
each recorded item. The record or a certified copy of it constitutes
presumptive evidence of the adoption of the ordinance. (I.C. 36-4-6-17)
   (C)   (1)   An ordinance, order, or resolution passed by the Common Council
is considered adopted when it is: signed by the Mayor and either approved by
the Mayor or passed over his veto by the Council, under I.C. 36-4-6-16. If
required by statute, an adopted ordinance, order, or resolution must be
promulgated or published before it takes effect.
      (2)   An ordinance prescribing a penalty or forfeiture for a violation
must, before it takes effect, be published in a manner prescribed by I.C. 5-3-
1, unless it is published under division (C)(3) below, or there is an urgent
necessity requiring its immediate effectiveness, the Mayor proclaims the urgent
necessity, and copies of the ordinance are posted in three public places in
each of the districts from which members are elected to the Council.
      (3)   Except as provided in division (C)(5) below, if a city publishes
any of its ordinances in book or pamphlet form, no other publication is
required. If an ordinance prescribing a penalty or forfeiture for a violation
is published under this section, it takes effect two weeks after the
publication of the book or pamphlet. Publication under this subdivision, if
authorized by the Council, constitutes presumptive evidence of the ordinances
in the book or pamphlet, of the date of adoption of the ordinance, and that the
ordinances have been properly signed, attested, recorded and approved.
      (4)   This division (C) does not apply to a zoning ordinance or amendment
to a zoning ordinance, or a resolution approving a comprehensive plan, that is
adopted under I.C. 36-7
      (5)    An ordinance increasing a building permit fee on new development
must be published one time in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1 and not later than 30
days after the ordinance is adopted by the legislative body in accordance with
I.C. 5-3-1 and delay the implementation of the fee increase for 90 days after
the date the ordinance is published as provided above. (I.C. 36-4-6-14)

declared to be a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding
$2,500. Every day any violation of this code or any such ordinance, rule or
regulation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. In any

conviction, the offender shall be assessed for that day and each day subsequent
thereto with respect to which it is proven and found that the person did commit

      (1)   This policy is the result of the recognition of a need to improve
and modernize the city’s purchasing capability and to enhance and assure fiscal
responsibility in the procurement process.
      (2)   The express purpose of the policy is to establish an efficient,
fiscally responsible purchasing system capable of providing daily service and
support on an organization wide basis. The policy outlined herein recognizes
and addresses the importance of the overall support mission of the procurement
process and the need for maximizing the value of each tax and utility dollar
expended. The objectives, policies and procedures set forth in subsequent
divisions of this policy were written and designed to ensure the citizenry,
City Council and employees are receiving maximum value for each tax and utility
dollar spent.
      (3)   The “art” of purchasing is a dynamic process. For this reason, this
policy shall be reviewed, and will be revised periodically in order to keep
abreast of, and current with continued developments in the “state of the art”
as it pertains to purchasing.
   (B)   Objectives of purchasing system. The objectives of the city’s
purchasing system are:
      (1)   To maintain minimum investment in materials inventory,
      (2)   To avoid duplication, waste and obsolescence with respect to
materials,
      (3)   To ensure that materials, equipment and services are purchased at
the lowest prices consistent with quality and performance,
      (4)   To provide adequate controls over city expenditures and financial
commitments,
      (5)   To obtain quality goods required by city departments and to ensure
that these goods are at the place needed and the time needed, and

         (d)   Purchases over $75,000 and under $150,000.
         (e)   Charge purchases paid by statement.
      (2)   Each of these categories requires a different level of

procedure, I.C. 5-22-7.
         (b)   Purchases of $5,000, but less than $75,000, are made through
informal quote procedure that requires a minimum of three quotes for items
costing between $5,000 and $75,000. Two quotes are acceptable in circumstances
that three are unattainable, clarification with the Clerk-Treasurer is
required. Purchases may be subject to the approval of the department governing
board.
         (c)   Purchases of $75,000, but less than $150,000, are made through
formal quote procedure that requires a minimum of three quotes for items
costing between $75,000 and $150,000. Two quotes are acceptable in
circumstances that three are unattainable, clarification with the Clerk-
Treasurer is required. Purchases may be subject to the approval of the
department governing board.
         (d)   Purchases under $5,000 may be authorized by the department head
through normal request to purchase and purchase order procedure.
   (D)   Competitive bidding.
      (1)   It is the policy of the city to procure needed materials, equipment
and services at the lowest cost consistent with quality and performance.
Whenever possible, purchase will be made only after two or more price

exceptions to this policy are:
         (a)   Sole-source purchases where only one supplier is available,
         (b)   Emergency purchases,
         (c)   Petty cash purchases, and
         (d)   Certain professional services such as architectural, banking,
engineering, insurance, and legal.
      (2)   For all other purchases, the following guidelines should be

obtained when:
            1.   Urgency is of prime consideration.
            2.   Specifications are clear and simple.

         (b)   Informal written price quotations should be obtained when:
            1.   Specifications are detailed.
            2.   Potential suppliers are not located nearby.
            3.   Needed items are “made to order.”
            4.   Cost of item is over $5,000 and is below $75,000.
         (c)   Formal written quotes will be solicited when the cost of items
exceeds $75,000 but is less than $150,000. This requires a formal letter
detailing the good or service being solicited and sent to intended vendors. The
delivery of said letter can be by USPS, hand delivered, or email.
   (E)   Emergency procedures. Covering supplies or services costing in excess
of $5,000.
      (1)   In case of an actual emergency and with the Clerk-Treasurer’s
permission, if possible, department heads may purchase directly any supplies or
services whose immediate procurement is essential to prevent delays in work
which may vitally affect the life, health and safety, or convenience of
Rochester residents.
      (2)   Within two working days, the department shall send to the Clerk-
Treasurer a purchase order with vendors invoice attached, with a full written
report of the circumstances of the emergency. If necessary, the Clerk-Treasurer
will authorize a confirming purchase order to cover the emergency purchase.
   (F)   Charge account purchases.
      (1)   Charge account purchases are the preferred method of purchase for
the city and may be used for those vendors for whom many repetitive purchases
are made as supplies are required. A purchase order is required for all
purchases over $5,000.
      (2)   Materials and services, for which purchase orders are used, will be
determined by each department head and approved by the Clerk-Treasurer and
Mayor. The following guidelines shall be used when utilizing charge account
purchases:
         (a)   All charge accounts will be established by the Clerk-Treasurer
to ensure appropriate vendor information is collected and accounts are
uniformly established with all vendors.
         (b)   Department heads shall establish, by department, the names of
those employees authorized to purchase, order, receive, and sign for items
under charge account purchases. Employees must be full-time with the exception
of the Parks Department seasonal operations. The Clerk-Treasurer has discretion
over the total number of employees per department on charge accounts to ensure
internal controls and management oversight.
         (c)   When charging supplies, the vendor’s package advice, packing
slip, or charge ticket or invoice must be signed by the authorized employee
receiving the material.
         (d)   Department heads, or authorized employee, shall confirm receipt
of the item by initialing the vendor’s package advice, packing slip, or charge
ticket if a purchase order is not completed.
         (e)   Each dpartment is responsible to see that all vendor invoices
are submitted directly from the vendor to the Clerk-Treasurer’s office in a
timely manner to ensure prompt claims processing. The vendor may email Accounts
Payable directly.
         (f)   Invoices signed by unauthorized personnel may not be paid.
   (G)   Joint purchasing with the State of Indiana. The city is authorized to
participate with the State of Indiana in joint purchasing. From time to time,
the city receives notices of various state contracts that show items available
for joint purchase. If these items are needed by the city and if it is
determined that the “state contract” items meet the city specifications at a
cost savings, then the item will be purchased under state joint purchasing
arrangements. A purchase order is placed directly with the supplier who has
been awarded the state contract.
   (H)   Joint purchasing. Where appropriate, the city shall continually
explore joint purchasing with other units of government. Joint purchasing can
result in substantially lower costs due to quantity purchasing.
   (I)   Gifts and gratuities.
      (1)   City employees are expressly prohibited from soliciting or
accepting any rebate, money or costly entertainment, gift or gratuity
(excepting mementos and novelties of nominal value) from any person, company,
firm or corporation to which any purchase order or contract is, or might be
awarded. The city will not tolerate circumstances that produce, or reasonably
appear to produce, conflicts between the personal interests of an employee and
interests of the city.
      (2)   Accordingly, the city may terminate, at no charge to the city, any
purchase order or contract if it is found that substantial gifts or gratuities
were offered to a city employee. The city may also take disciplinary action,
including dismissal, against an employee who solicits or accepts gifts or
gratuities of any value whatsoever.
      (3)   Employees attending continuing education conferences may utilize
the vendor booths/exhibitor hall to acquire novelty items such as but not
limited to pens, pencils, notepads, and the like. Vendors offering networking
opportunities including dining opportunities are also acceptable and should not
construed as a conflict as stated above.
   (J)   Purchasing recycled products and materials. Department heads shall
make every effort to purchase items that have been recycled or contain
substantially recycled materials. Department heads shall continuously review
their purchases to identify items where recycled materials may be substituted.
   (K)   Procurement procedure - request to purchase.
      (1)   The preparation of the purchase order initiates the procurement
cycle. The receipt of the purchase order with the necessary information and
required signature gives authority for each specific purchase. A vendor invoice
may not be paid unless proper procurement procedures are followed.
      (2)   The following procedure shall be followed for all purchases over
$5,000 and under $75,000:
         (a)   Department head or designated city employee (“employee”)
determines the need for a specific service or item(s). The employee will
provide the appropriate number of quotes/bids as determined by the guidelines
outlined above. All charges pertinent to the purchase should be included in the
quote; freight, labor, type of materials, discounts for a total due, net 30
days. No sales tax: if sales tax is included, the department head/employee will
be responsible for paying the tax out of their pocket.
         (b)   Department head or designated authority reviews purchase request
and evaluates need for the item or service.
         (c)   Department head or designated authority checks budget to verify
funds are appropriated and available then completes the procurement process.
         (d)   Department head approves purchase order and forwards the
request, to the Mayor’s Office for review and signature.
         (e)   The Mayor then forwards the purchase order to the Clerk-
Treasurer, who reviews the purchase order for accuracy and completeness.
Additionally, the Clerk-Treasurer will check the budget report and outstanding
purchase orders to verify funds are appropriated and available.
         (f)   The purchase order is then submitted to Accounts Payable for
review and processing.
         (g)   Department heads shall designate an employee to receive items
from vendors. The receiver inspects items to ensure they conform to
specifications and quantities shown on purchase order/invoice.
         (h)   Purchase orders shall be forwarded to the Clerk-Treasurer office
as soon as they are created with the accompanying invoice. Nothing will be paid
using an estimate or quote, all purchases must have an invoice or charge
account slip.
         (i)   For purchases under $5,000 the same procedure is followed except
the request to purchase does not require a purchase order.
      (3)   This policy and these procedures are designed to ensure proper
measures are in place to establish an efficient and responsible manner of
purchasing. The objectives set forth have been designed to ensure standard and
uniform practices are being implemented in every department of the city. It is
the desire of the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office and Common Council to provide
direction and supervision in this area so as to assist and support the quality
of service to the residents of the city.

FIXED ASSET CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 35.30 PURPOSE; CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to facilitate the preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
   (B)   Classification of assets. Capital assets are personal and real
property used in the operations of the government that have an expected
estimated useful life beyond a single period. Capital assets are to include any
item that falls into one of the following categories:
      (1)   Land.
      (2)   Land improvements.
      (3)   Buildings.
      (4)   Machinery and equipment.
      (5)   Vehicles.
      (6)   Computer software.
      (7)   General infrastructure.
      (8)   Construction in progress.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.31 CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLDS.
   (A)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting purposes, an
item must be at or above the capitalization threshold and have a unit
historical cost of $5,000 or more. Assets will remain as part of the property
record until they are retired or are disposed of, sold, traded in, and the
like, regardless of net book value amount.
   (B)   The capitalization threshold for the following classes of assets shall
be:
 
Land                                 N/A
Land improvements                    $10,000
Building improvements                $10,000
Machinery and equipment and vehicles $5,000
Computer software                    $5,000
General infrastructure improvements  $50,000
Construction in progress             N/A
 
   (C)   With regard to improvements to buildings and general infrastructure, a
capital outlay must be significant and increase capacity, increase efficiency,
or extend the asset’s estimated useful life beyond the original expectation.
   (D)   A change in capacity increases the level of service provided by the
asset. A change in efficiency increases the level of service but without
increasing the size of the asset or the change maintains the same level of
service at a lower cost. For example, an addition to a building provides
increased square footage, hence, the capacity is increased and the capital
outlay is capitalized. Widening a road with additional lanes increases capacity
and, hence, the capital outlay is capitalized. An extended estimated useful
life involves a significant alternation, structural change or improvement.
   (E)   While substantial repairs and renovations will be reviewed for
potential capitalization, it is anticipated that most will be expensed in the
current year. These expenses often merely restore the asset to the original
service potential but do not necessarily improve the asset.
   (F)   All land, including rights-of-way, is capitalized at the time of
acquisition regardless of historical costs or fair value if donated.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.32 HISTORICAL COST OR ESTIMATED HISTORICAL COSTS.
   (A)   Prospective reporting. Capital assets are recorded at historical cost
which includes any ancillary charges necessary to place the asset into its
intended location and condition for use. Ancillary charges include, for
example, freight and transportation charges, site preparation costs, and
professional fees. Engineering costs (internal and external) include related
preliminary project and environmental studies; project estimating, design, and
planning (drawings and specifications); and construction engineering,
construction management, construction inspection and project payment. Donated
capital assets are recorded at their estimated fair value at the time of
acquisition.
   (B)   Retroactive reporting at transition of Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 34. When actual historical cost source data was
unavailable, estimated historical cost was developed utilizing a normal costing
approach. With this method of estimating historical cost, a current replacement
cost was ascertained. An appropriate cost index (including Consumer Price Index
and Federal Highway Price Trends) corresponding to an estimated date of
acquisition/construction was then applied to “deflate” the replacement cost to
an estimated historical cost.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.33 ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS; DEPRECIATION METHOD/
CONVENTION.
   (A)   Capital assets have estimated useful lives extending beyond a single
reporting period (one year) and are depreciated using the straight-line method
with no allowance for salvage value. The estimated useful lives currently used
were developed with the input of knowledgeable staff and reflect our
government’s experience with these assets:
Land                    Non-depreciable
Land improvements       20 years
Buildings               50 years
Machinery and equipment 5 years
Vehicles
Autos                   5 years
Light trucks            10 years
Heavy trucks            15 years
General infrastructure  20 to 100 years
Computer software       5 years
 
   (B)   Depreciation will be calculated using the straight-line method and
full-year convention. No salvage value or residual value will be recognized.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.34 ASSETS PURCHASE WITH FEDERAL OR STATE GRANTS.
   Assets at or above a threshold of $5,000 on a unit basis funded with a
federal grant are to be reported for federal compliance purposes,
notwithstanding §§
35.60 through
35.67. To achieve this end a subsidiary list or other indicator is to be
established and maintained annually and includes all such assets currently in
use.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.35 RETIREMENTS.
   (A)   Retirements apply to all capital assets including land, buildings,
machinery and equipment, vehicles, and general infrastructure.
   (B)   When an asset is disposed of, scrapped, sold, subject to demolition,
and the like, it is to be removed from the property record and the appropriate
reduction will be made to historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net
book value amounts.
   (C)   Retirements will reflect the actual historical cost of the asset when
the amount is ascertainable. When historical cost is not ascertainable, an
estimated historical cost will be determined.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
§ 35.36 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY RECORD MAINTENANCE; PROPERTY CONTROL.
   (A)   Property record maintenance.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer will ensure that reporting for capital assets
is being exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially
and periodically in subsequent years. The Clerk-Treasurer will further ensure
that the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect improvements,
additions, retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital
asset balance for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated
depreciation calculations and net book value amounts.
      (2)   Day-to-day stewardship of personal property above the
capitalization threshold of $5,000 is the responsibility of the department
utilizing the property.
      (3)   For annual updating of the capital asset report, the departments
have the responsibility to report improvements, additions, retirements, and
transfers in detail to the Clerk-Treasurer. It is expected that this reporting
will be in a timely manner, as the capital asset record must be updated
annually.
      (4)   To restate, additions of assets at or above the unit capitalization
threshold of $5,000 are to be reported to the Clerk-Treasurer by the
departments upon purchase or receipt of the asset. These will be verified per
the claims process by the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. Transfers and retirements
of assets at or above the $5,000 unit threshold are to be reported as such by
the departments to the Clerk-Treasurer at the time of the transaction.
   (B)   Property control.
      (1)   Capital assets below the capitalization threshold of $5,000 on a
unit basis but warranting “control” shall be inventoried at the department
level and an appropriate list will be maintained. Data elements are to include
purchase date, purchase price, asset description, location, make, model, serial
number, and other information that assists control or deemed relevant.
      (2)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered sensitive
may include, for example, weapons, radios, personal computers, laptop
computers, printers, fax machines, and small power tools. These minor but
sensitive items shall be inventoried and controlled at the department level.
Stewardship of these minor but sensitive items is the responsibility of the
departments utilizing these properties.
      (3)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall determine appropriate means, level of
detailed data elements, and the system to be utilized. Finally, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall have the right to request copies of the inventory and/or
updated inventory of controllable items so as to periodically review the
information and adherence to policy.
(Ord. 10-2023, passed 12-19-23)
MATERIALITY THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING IRREGULAR MATERIAL VARIANCES,
LOSSES, SHORTAGES, AND THEFTS
§ 35.40 POLICY ADOPTED.
   The city hereby endorses the Clerk-Treasurer’s directive as set forth below
regarding a policy on materiality and a process for reporting material items.
(Ord. 04-2016, passed 5-24-16)
§ 35.41 MATERIALITY THRESHOLD.
   (A)   Definition. For purposes of this subchapter, MATERIAL shall mean a
significant or consequential amount, as it pertains to the city, taking into

are identified timely and promptly corrected with no loss to the city, and
except for losses from genuine accidents.
(Ord. 04-2016, passed 5-24-16)
§ 35.42 MATERIALITY VARIANCES.
   (A)   Reporting mandate. All erroneous or irregular variances, losses,
shortages, or thefts of city funds or property, or funds or property the city

   (C)   Corrective action. The city shall investigate all erroneous or
irregular variances, shortages, losses, or thefts regardless of whether they
meet the materiality threshold established by this policy. Upon conclusion of
each such investigation, the city shall:
      (1)   Implement procedures designed to prevent the recurrence of such
incidents;
      (2)   Take appropriate disciplinary action against the employee
responsible for the incident.
(Ord. 04-2016, passed 5-24-16)
§ 35.44 ENFORCEMENT; REPORT TO STATE BOARD OF ACCOUNTS.
   The city calls upon the Clerk-Treasurer, city officials, employees, and
agents to enforce and comply with the policy on materiality and process for
reporting material items and to report noteworthy items to the State Board of

by law.
(Ord. 14-2016, passed 12-17-16)
COST PRINCIPLES FOR SPENDING FEDERAL FUNDS
§ 35.60 IMPLEMENTATION.
   The Clerk-Treasurer is responsible for the efficient and effective
administration of grant funds through the application of sound management
practices. Such funds shall be administered in a manner consistent with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, the associated agreements/assurances,
program objectives and the specific terms and conditions of the grant award.
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.61 COST PRINCIPLES.
   Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs shall meet the following
general criteria in order to be allowable under federal awards:
   (A)   (1)   Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient performance
and administration of the federal award and be allocable thereto under these
principles.
      (2)   To determine whether a cost is reasonable, consideration shall be
given to:
         (a)   Whether a cost is a type generally recognized as ordinary and
necessary for the operation of the city or the proper and efficient performance
of the federal award;
         (b)   The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound
business practices, arm’s length bargaining, federal, state, local, tribal and
other laws and regulations;
         (c)   Market prices for comparable goods or services for the
geographic area;
         (d)   Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the
circumstances considering their responsibilities; and
         (e)   Whether the cost represents any significant deviation from the
established practices or policy of the City Council or the Board of Public
Works and Safety which may increase the expense.
      (3)   While federal regulations do not provide specific descriptions of
what satisfies the “necessary” element beyond its inclusion in the
reasonableness analysis above, whether a cost is necessary is determined based
on the needs of the program. Specifically, the expenditure must be necessary to
achieve an important program objective. A key aspect in determining whether a
cost is necessary is whether the city can demonstrate that the cost addresses
an existing need, and can prove it.
When determining whether a cost is necessary, consideration may be given to
whether:
         (a)   The cost is needed for the proper and efficient performance of
the grant program;
         (b)   The cost is identified in the approved budget or application;
         (c)   There is a benefit to the city or its citizens associated with
the cost;
         (d)   The cost aligns with identified needs based on results and
findings from a needs assessment; and
         (e)   The cost addresses program goals and objectives and is based on
program data.
      (4)   A cost is allocable to the federal award if the goods or services
involved are chargeable or assignable to the federal award in accordance with
the relative benefit received.
   (B)   Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth as cost principles
in Part 200 or in the terms and conditions of the federal award.
   (C)   Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to
both federally-financed and other activities of the city.
   (D)   Be afforded consistent treatment. A cost cannot be assigned to a
federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstances has been assigned as an indirect cost under another
award.
   (E)   Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
   (F)   (1)   Be representative of actual cost, net of all applicable credits
or offsets.
      (2)   The term APPLICABLE CREDITS refers to those receipts or reductions
of expenditures that operate to offset or reduce expense items allocable to the
federal award. Typical examples of such transactions are: purchase discounts;
rebates or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; and adjustments of
overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to
or received by the state relate to the federal award, they shall be credited to
the federal award, either as a cost reduction or a cash refund, as appropriate.
   (G)   Not be included as a match or cost-share, unless the specific federal
program authorizes federal costs to be treated as such.
   (H)   Be adequately documented:
      (1)   In the case of personal services, the Clerk-Treasurer shall
implement a system for city personnel to account for time and efforts expended
on grant funded programs to assure that only permissible personnel expenses are
allocated;
      (2)   In the case of other costs, all receipts and other invoice
materials shall be retained, along with any documentation identifying the need
and purpose for such expenditure if not otherwise clear.
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.62 SELECTED ITEMS OF COST.
   The city shall follow the rules for selected items of cost at 2 C.F.R. Part
200, Subpart E when charging these specific expenditures to a federal grant.
When applicable, city staff shall check costs against the selected items of
cost requirements to ensure the cost is allowable. In addition, state, city and
program-specific rules, including the terms and conditions of the award, may
deem a cost as unallowable, and city personnel shall follow those rules as
well.
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.63 COST COMPLIANCE.
   The Clerk-Treasurer shall require that grant program funds are expended and
are accounted for consistent with the requirements of the specific program and
as identified in the grant application. Compliance monitoring includes
accounting for direct or indirect costs and reporting them as permitted or
required by each grant.
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.64 DETERMINING WHETHER A COST IS DIRECT OR INDIRECT.
   (A)   (1)   Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically
with a particular final cost objective, such as a federal award, or other
internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to
such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.
      (2)   These costs may include: salaries and fringe benefits of employees
working directly on a grant-funded project; purchased services contracted for
performance under the grant; travel of employees working directly on a grant-
funded project; materials, supplies, and equipment purchased for use on a
specific grant; and infrastructure costs directly attributable to the program
(such as long distance telephone calls specific to the program, and the like).
   (B)   (1)   Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for a common or
joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective and are not readily
assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted without effort
disproportionate to the results achieved. Costs incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstances shall be treated consistently as either direct or
indirect costs.
      (2)   These costs may include: general data processing, human resources,
utility costs, maintenance, accounting, and the like.
      (3)   Federal education programs with supplement not supplant provisions
must use a restricted indirect cost rate. In a restricted rate, indirect costs
are limited to general management costs. General management costs do not
include divisional administration that is limited to one component of the city,
the City Council, compensation of the Clerk-Treasurer, compensation of the
Mayor, and operation of the immediate offices of these officers.
      (4)   The salaries of administrative and clerical staff normally should
be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate
only if all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project or
activity.
         (b)   Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the
project or activity.
         (c)   Such costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the
prior written approval of the federal awarding agency.
         (d)   The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.
   (C)   Where a federal program has a specific cap on the percentage of
administrative costs that may be charged to a grant, that cap shall include all
direct administrative charges as well as any recovered indirect charges.
   (D)   Effort should be given to identify costs as direct costs whenever
practical, but allocation of indirect costs may be used where not prohibited
and where indirect cost allocation is approved ahead of time by the Indiana
State Board of Accounts or the pass-through entity (federal funds subject to 2
C.F.R. Part 200 pertaining to determining indirect cost allocation).
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.65 TIMELY OBLIGATION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   Obligations are orders placed for property and services, contracts and
subawards made, and similar transactions during a given period that require
payment by the non-federal entity during the same or a future period.
   (B)   The following table illustrates when funds are determined to be
obligated under any federal agency regulations:
      (1)   If the obligation is for:
         (a)   Acquisition of property - on the date which the city makes a
binding written commitment to acquire the property.
         (b)   Personal services by an employee of the city - when the services
are performed.
   (C)   Personal services by a contractor who is not an employee of the city -
on the date which the city makes a binding written commitment to obtain the
services.
   (D)   Public utility services - when the city receives the services.
   (E)   Travel - when the travel is taken.
   (F)   Rental of property - when the city uses the property.

(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.66 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   All obligations must occur on or between the beginning and ending
dates of the grant project. This period of time is known as the period of
performance. The period of performance is dictated by statute and will be
indicated in the grant award notification (“GAN”). As a general rule, state-
administered federal funds are available for obligation within the year that
Congress appropriates the funds for. However, given the unique nature of
educational institutions, for many federal education grants, the period of
performance is 27 months. This maximum period includes a 15-month period of
initial availability, plus a 12-month period for carryover. For direct grants,
the period of performance is generally identified in the GAN.
   (B)   In the case of a state-administered grant, obligations under a grant
may not be made until the grant funding period begins or all necessary
materials are submitted to the granting agency, whichever is later. In the case
of a direct grant, obligations may begin when the grant is approved, unless an
agreement exists with State Board of Accounts or the pass-through entity to
reimburse for pre-approval expenses.
   (C)   For both state-administered and direct grants, regardless of the
period of availability, the city shall liquidate all obligations incurred under
the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period unless an
extension is authorized. Any funds not obligated within the period of
performance or liquidated within the appropriate timeframe are said to lapse
and shall be returned to the awarding agency. Consequently, the city shall
closely monitor grant spending throughout the grant cycle.
(Ord. 05-2023, passed 6-27-23)
§ 35.67 VALIDITY OF THIS POLICY.
   This Cost Principles for Spending Federal Funds Policy is and shall be valid
upon adoption and publication as required by law and shall remain valid
indefinitely.

§ 36.07 TESTING PROCEDURES REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The following testing procedures are to be strictly observed by any
collection facility and/or laboratory contracted with the city in order to
carry out its drug and alcohol testing program.
   (B)   Controlled substance testing procedures include the following;
      (1)   Chain of custody. Chain of custody is defined as procedures to
account for the integrity of each urine specimen by tracking it's handling and
storage from point of specimen collection to final disposition of the specimen.
These procedures will require an approved chain of custody form.
      (2)   Preparation of testing.
         (a)   Use of tamperproof seal system designed in a manner that a
specimen bottle top can be sealed against undetected opening and the bottle has
a means for identification of the test subject, either by number or some other
confidential manner.
         (b)   Use of shipping container in which one or more specimens and
associated paper work may be transferred and which can be sealed and initialed
to prevent undetected tampering.
         (c)   Written procedures and instructions for collection site.
      (3)   Specimen collection. Specimen collection will be done at collection
sites designated by the city.
      (4)   Laboratory analysis. Laboratory analysis of all specimens collected
will be done by a NIDA certified laboratory under all federal guidelines.
      (5)   Review of results of the laboratory tests.
         (a)   The laboratory reports the test results of the city's Medical
Review Officer (MRO) within an average of five working days.
         (b)   Both positive and negative results must be reported. The report,
as certified by the responsible laboratory individual shall indicate the drug/
metabolites tested for, whether the results are positive or negative, and the
cut-off level for each drug analyzed, the specimen number assigned to the
specimen and the drug testing laboratory identification number. All tests
submitted to the laboratory at the same time must be submitted to the MRO at
the same time.
         (c)   The laboratory may transmit the test results to the MRO by
various electronic means such as teleprinter, facsimile or computer, so long as
those methods established are designed to maintain confidentiality. Results
cannot, at any time, be provided verbally by telephone. The laboratory must
also transmit to the MRO the original or a certified copy of urine chain of
custody and control form and must identify the individual responsible for the
day-to-day management of the laboratory process.
      (6)   The role of the Medical Review Officer.
         (a)   The MRO must be licensed M.D. or D.O. and principally serve as
an arbiter between the laboratory and the city. The MRO must possess a
knowledge of drug abuse disorders. It is the primary role of the MRO to review
and interpret positive results obtained from the laboratory. The MRO must
access and determine whether alternate medical explanations could account for
the positive test results.
         (b)   To accomplish this task, the MRO may conduct medical interview
of the individual's medical history and review and other relevant bio-medical
factors. Additionally the MRO must examine all medical records as evidence of
prescribed medications.
         (c)   The MRO must give the individual testing positive an opportunity
to discuss the test results. If the tested individual provides sufficient
medical documentation that the positive result derives from the use of legally
prescribed medication the MRO may allow the driver to continue to operate, or
the MRO may request the opinion of another physician.
         (d)   After the individual testing positive has been given the
opportunity to provide sufficient information, and the MRO makes a final
decision, the city is notified of the results of the substance test.
      (7)   The need for confidentiality. All information obtained in the
course of testing employees shall be protected as confidential medical
information. No data concerning this information will be made part of the
driver's personnel file or will be provided to any other party without the
written consent of the driver.
      (8)   The appeal process available to drivers testing positive. If a
driver tests positive, he/she has the right to question the results by;
         (a)   Contact with the MRO to verify the sample number of the urine
sample to the MRO's form.
         (b)   Requesting the split-sample be tested within 72 hours of the
original testing.
      (9)   Alcohol testing procedures. Alcohol testing procedures include the
following;
         (a)   Testing devices. 
            1.   Alcohol tests are to be conducted with only evidential breath
testing devices (EBT's) approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) on their Conforming Products List (CPL)
            2.   The rules allow the use of EBT's for the initial screening
test £hat are on the CPL, that do not meet the additional requirements for the
confirmation test (e.g. sequential numbering and print-out capability)
         (b)   Test administrators. Only a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) that
has had proper training may administer breath alcohol tests. Reasonable cause
tests may not be conducted by the person making the determination that
suspicion exists to conduct an alcohol test.
         (c)   Test procedures.  
            1.   The BAT will perform an initial alcohol screen. If the initial
screen results in a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.02% or above, a
confirmation test is required. Any tests resulting in a BAC of less than 0.02%
will be considered negative. The BAT will wait a minimum of 15 minutes, before
administering the confirmation test. Confirmation tests must be performed
within 20 minutes.
            2.   The Superintendent, or his designee will be responsible for
maintaining in municipal files and on a confidential basis all records required
by the federal regulations under this testing program.

§ 37.01 NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY.
   (A)   Policy statement.
      (1)   General commitment to non-discrimination.
         (a)   The city prohibits discrimination and/or the exclusion of
individuals from its municipal facilities, programs, activities and services
based on the individual person’s race, color, national origin, sex, age,
disability, low income status, sexual orientation or limited English
proficiency. The city affirms its commitment to providing meaningful
opportunities and access to municipal facilities, programs, activities and
services in an effort to comply with all laws including: Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended (hereinafter “Title VI”); Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, as amended.
         (b)   The city will post a Title VI notice to the public at each
facility that receives and/or provides programs, goods, and/or services to the
public.
      (2)   Persons with disabilities. The city is committed to including
qualified individuals with disabilities in municipal services, programs and
activities. For further information please see the city’s ADA Transition Plan.
      (3)   Limited English speaking (LEP) persons.
         (a)   The city is committed to providing persons with limited English
proficiency (LEP) meaningful access and equal opportunity to participate in our
services, activities and programs. The city will take reasonable steps to
ensure that persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) have meaningful
access and an equal opportunity to participate in our services, activities,
programs and other benefits.
         (b)   Which documents must be translated, when oral translation is
necessary, and whether such services must be immediately available depend on
many factors. As a result, the city is committed to following the United States
Department of Justice (USDOJ) guidance on making such determinations, which
includes determining:
            1.   Number or proportion of LEP individuals;
            2.    Frequency of contact with the program;
            3.   Nature and importance of the program;
            4.   Resources available to the city.
         (c)   This will be monitored and accomplished through the use of
language identification flashcards made available through the United States
Census 2010. Additionally LEP and other disadvantaged encounters will be
tracked by city personnel through the use of encounter forms placed at the
front desk of each department. Each department head will determine how this
policy is incorporated in their individual department and its needs.
      (4)   Contacting the city. Individuals with requests for services,
questions or complaints concerning the city’s Non-Discrimination Policy should
contact the city’s Title VI Coordinator at:
                        City Clerk-Treasurer’s Office
                        320 Main Street/ P.O. Box 110
                        Rochester, IN 46975
                        574-223-2510
   (B)   Non-discrimination standard operating procedures.
      (1)   Elimination of discrimination. The city will continue to work to
identify and eliminate discrimination on race, color race, color, national
origin, sex, age, disability, low income status, sexual orientation or limited
English proficiency. If discrimination is found to exist, the city will
implement appropriate policies, procedures or programs to eliminate the
discrimination. Programs and procedures, include, but are not limited to:
limited English proficiency access plan; extend contracting and subcontracting
activities to disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE) and non-DBE minority and
female owned business; and monitoring contractors and consultants for Title VI
compliance.
      (2)   Public outreach. The city is committed to providing the general
public with information on the non-discrimination protections provided by Title
VI, Section 504 and the ADA. The city will pursue all available opportunities
to educate the public on issues relating to discrimination under Title VI,
Section 504 and the ADA. Public outreach may include, but is not limited to,
posting the city’s non-discrimination policy in public locations, including the
city’s non-discrimination policy in public notices as appropriate, and posting
the city’s non-discrimination policy on the city’s website.
      (3)   Limited English proficiency.
         (a)   The city will take reasonable steps to ensure that persons with
limited English proficiency (LEP) have meaningful access and an equal
opportunity to participate in our services, activities, programs and other
benefits.
         (b)   For any program or project receiving federal funds the city will
conduct a four-part analysis to determine what, if any, limited English
proficiency services will be required.
         (c)   The four factors to be considered in determining the need and
type of language assistance services are:
            1.   Number or proportion of LEP individuals;
            2.   Frequency of contact with the program;
            3.   Nature and importance of the program;
            4.   Resources available to the city.
         (d)   If a review of the first two factors show that less than 5% of
the intended beneficiaries of the program or project are limited English
proficient, no language assistance measures will be developed for that program
or project. This will be determined through United States Census Bureau data as
well as a review of encounter forms completed by city personnel.
         (e)   However, in an effort to ensure that persons with limited
English proficiency have meaningful access and equal opportunity, the city will
accommodate any and all requests for oral or written translation services with
a 72-hour notice of request for services.
         (f)   If more than 5% of the intended beneficiaries of the program or
project are limited English proficient, the city will review the nature and
importance of the program or project to determine what language assistance
measures should be developed for the program or project. The resources
available to the city should be considered in determining the appropriate
language assistance measures. Language assistance measures may include, but are
not limited to, oral translation services, including the use of a telephone
interpreter line, and written translation services.
      (4)   Monitoring contractors and consultants. The city will ensure that
all federally funded contracts contain required Title VI assurances prohibiting
discrimination in violation of the city’s policy on non-discrimination. The
city will monitor consultants and contractors for compliance with the city’s
non-discrimination policy. The city will promptly investigate any alleged claim
of discrimination and will work with the consultant or contractor to obtain
voluntary compliance with the city’s non-discrimination policy.
   (C)   Complaint procedure.
      (1)   Any person who believes that he or she, on the basis of race,
color, national origin, gender, age, disability, religion, low income status,
or limited English proficiency, has been excluded from or denied participation
in, been denied the benefits of, or otherwise been subjected to discrimination
in or under any program or activity receiving federal funding assistance in
violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended and its
related statutes, regulations and directives, may submit a complaint. The city
assures every effort will be made to ensure nondiscrimination in all of its
programs and activities, whether those programs and activities are federally
funded or not.
      (2)   Complaint forms can be obtained from the city. Individuals are not
required to use the complaint form and may submit a complaint in any format
that includes the name, address and telephone number of the individual
complaining and brief description of the alleged discriminatory conduct
including the date of harm. An individual submitting a complaint alleging
discrimination may include relevant evidence, including the names of witnesses
and supporting documentation. A complaint must be signed by the complainant.

                     Rochester, IN 46975
                     574-223-2510
      (4)   Within 60 days of the receipt of the complaint, the Title VI
Coordinator will conduct an investigation of the allegation based on the
information provided and issue a written report of its findings to the
complainant. The Title VI Coordinator will try to obtain an informal voluntary
resolution to all complaints at the lowest level possible.
      (5)   Any person aggrieved by the findings of the Title VI Coordinator
may, within 15 days of the receipt of the response of the Title VI Coordinator,
file an appeal to the Office of the Mayor. Within 15 calendar days after
receipt of the appeal of the Title VI Coordinator’s report, the Mayor or his or
her designee will meet with the complainant to discuss the complaint and the
possible resolutions. Within 15 calendar days of the meeting, the Office of the
Mayor will respond in writing, will explain the position of the Mayor and offer
a final resolution of the complaint.

formal complaint with any government agency or affect an individual’s right to
seek private counsel for any complaint alleging discrimination.

SEWER USE
§ 51.14 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and policy.
      (1)   This subchapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the
publicly owned treatment works for the City of Rochester (“city” or
“Rochester”) and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and
federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq) and the
general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this
subchapter are:
         (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly
owned treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
         (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly
owned treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment
works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works;
         (c)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may
be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
         (d)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the publicly owned treatment works;
         (e)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost
of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment
works; and
         (F)   To enable the city to comply with its national pollutant
discharge elimination system permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned
treatment works is subject.
      (2)   This subchapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned
treatment works. This subchapter authorizes the issuance of individual
wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires
user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
      (3)   Unless otherwise defined herein, terms shall have the meanings
adopted in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water
and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, American
Waterworks Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 136. Waste constituents and characteristics shall be
measured by standard methods unless a mutually agreed upon acceptable
alternative method is adopted by agreement of the permittee and the permitting
authority or any other method is established by federal or state regulatory
agencies. Monitoring and metering shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods.
   (B)   Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Wastewater

notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.
   (C)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or area proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (B) above, and which in the
judgment of the Board may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment or receiving waters, or otherwise create a hazard to life
or constitute a public nuisance, the Board may:
      (1)   Develop and enforce specific limits on prohibited substances.
      (2)   Require new industries, or industries with significant increase in
discharges, to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain
prior approval for discharges.
      (3)   Enter the premises of any industrial user to conduct inspections,
surveillance, record review, and/or monitoring, as necessary to determine
compliance with the SUO and, if applicable, any effective industrial wastewater
pretreatment permit.

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole, except for application for NPDES Permits and
report there of which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA, 40 CFR Part 136 and any subsequent revisions
subject to approval by the city. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, CBOD, suspended solids and ammonia analysis are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas PHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.)
   (G)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby a compatible industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment
therefore, by the industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with the
rate ordinance.

§ 51.20 ABNORMAL WASTE SURCHARGE.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the Board shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger than
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The Board shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage discharged either directly or indirectly to the POTW, in that manner, by
that method, and at those times as the Board may deem practicable in light of
the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine
the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to
the Board at all times.
   (B)   Additional charges for treating stronger than normal domestic waste
are based on the following thresholds and rates:
      (1)   Total suspended solids (TSS) - shall be surcharged in excess of 250
mg/l at a rate of $0.24/lb.
      (2)   CBOD - shall be surcharged in excess of 250 mg/l of at a rate of
$0.24/lb.
      (3)   Ammonia - shall be surcharged in excess of 20 mg/l at a rate of
$0.69/lb.
      (4)   COD - shall be surcharged in excess of 500 mg/l at a rate of $0.24/
lb.
      (5)   Phosphorus - shall be surcharged in excess of 10 mg/l at a rate of
$1.80/lb.

city and the hearing shall be held on a business day no earlier than ten days
after notice of the show cause order is given. In this regard, the show cause
order shall be served upon the user in accordance with division (M) below and
the show cause order is effective on the date considered given in accordance
with division (N) below. At any hearing held pursuant to this subchapter,
testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically or
mechanically. The person to whom the show cause order was issued, or any other
person with an interest in the proceedings may appear in person or by counsel
at the hearing. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed,
enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate. Each person appearing at the
hearing is entitled to present evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses and
present arguments. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any
member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual
charges therefor.
      (4)   After the Board of Public Works and Safety has reviewed the
evidence and if it finds any violation(s) of this subchapter, any prohibition,
limitation or requirement contained herein or of the user’s discharge permit,
or of any order issued hereunder, it shall make findings and it may issue to
the user responsible for the discharge any orders or directives as are
necessary and appropriate. Issuance of a show cause order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate this subchapter, discharge permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he or she
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not
come into compliance within the specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued to the user unless and until adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Such service shall not recommence until such time as the user is able to
demonstrate that it can and will maintain compliance. Failure to comply with
this compliance order may subject the user to having its connection to the
sanitary sewer sealed by the city and assessed the costs therefor. Compliance
orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably
necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not
limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring and improved management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user is violating this
subchapter, the user’s discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations
are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
      (2)   In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be given by the
Superintendent by telephone. In non-emergency situations, the cease and desist
order may be used to suspend or revoke discharge permits. Issuance of a cease
and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the user.
   (F)   Revocation order. When the Superintendent finds that a user is
violating this subchapter, the user’s discharge permit, any order issued
hereunder, any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or any order or
directive issued by the Board of Public Works and Safety pursuant to a show
cause hearing, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user revoking the
user’s discharge permit and directing the user to immediately stop or eliminate
non-domestic contribution into the city’s POTW. Failure to comply with this
order may subject the user to having any or all connections to the sanitary
sewer sealed by the city and assessed the costs therefor. Revocation orders may
be issued by the Superintendent pursuant to § 51.23 and shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The city may, upon informal notice to the user, immediately suspend
a user’s discharge permit whenever such suspension is necessary, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, in order to halt or prevent an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an immediate or substantial
endangerment to human health, to the welfare of the public, or to the
environment, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or is
causing or will cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the waste water treatment
service and/or the discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including, but not limited to, immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals or to the environment.
      (3)   The Superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in §
51.35(H) are initiated against the user.
      (4)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing.
      (5)   Compliance with the conditions, requirements and terms of the
suspension order shall not be construed to relieve the user of its obligation
to comply with its discharge permit which remains in full force and effect nor
does such compliance excuse previous violations. Additional enforcement action
may be pursued if corrective actions are not accomplished as required and the
city expressly reserves the right to seek any and all remedies available to it
under this subchapter for any violations cited by the suspension order.
Further, a failure to comply with any of the conditions, requirements or terms
of the suspension order shall constitute a further violation of this subchapter
and may subject the user to such other enforcement response that may be
appropriate.
      (6)   The Superintendent may deny or condition new or increased
discharges by a user or changes in the nature of pollutants discharged by the
user if the discharge does not meet applicable pretreatment standards or will
cause the city to violate its NPDES permit.
      (7)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions of §
51.23, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
51.21.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 51.35(C) why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Rochester
Board of Public Works and Safety shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (I)   Right of appeal; Board of Public Works and Safety.
      (1)   Any user or applicant for any permit filed pursuant to this
ordinance affected by any decision, action, or determination, including cease
and desist orders, made by any Rochester representative; e.g., Inspector,
Superintendent, Board, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this
subchapter, or any permit issued herein, or the denial of any application for
permit provided in this subchapter, may file with the Superintendent a written
request for reconsideration within 30 days of such a decision, action, or
determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user’s request
for reconsideration.
      (2)   If the ruling made by the Superintendent is unsatisfactory to the
person requesting reconsideration, he or she may within 30 days from the
notification of the Superintendent, file a written appeal to the Rochester
Board of Public Works and Safety. The written appeal shall be heard by the
Board within 30 days from the date of filing. The Rochester Board of Public
Works and Safety shall make a final ruling on the appeal within 30 days of the
close of the meeting. The Rochester Board of Public Works and Safety’s
decision, action, or determination shall remain in effect during such period of
reconsideration.
      (3)   The findings of the Board of Public Works and Safety shall be in
writing and shall be available to the public upon request. However, neither the
city nor the Board of Public Works and Safety is required to give any person
notice of the findings and orders issued thereto other than the user or
applicant to whom said orders may be directed. The findings and any orders
issued by the Board of Public Works and Safety shall be served upon the user in
accordance with division (M) below and the notice is effective on the date
considered given in accordance with division (N) below.
      (4)   Compliance with the conditions, requirements and terms of any of
the orders issued by the Board of Public Works and Safety pursuant to division
(C)(4) above will not be construed to relieve theuser of its obligation to
comply with its wastewater contribution permit which remains in full force and
effect nor does such compliance excuse previous violations. Additional
enforcement action may be pursued if corrective actions are not accomplished as
scheduled and the city expressly reserves the right to seek any and all
remedies available to it for any violation found by the Board of Public Works
and Safety. Further, a failure to comply with any of the conditions,
requirements or terms of the orders shall constitute a further violation of
this subchapter and may subject the user to such other enforcement response
that may be appropriate.
      (5)   Any action taken by the Board of Public Works and Safety under this
subchapter is subject to review by the Circuit or Superior Court of the County
out of which the matter dealt with by the Board of Public Works and Safety
arose, on the request of any user or applicant to whom the respective order was
issued or to any interested party. Any person requesting judicial review under
this subchapter section must file a verified complaint with the Clerk of the
appropriate Circuit or Superior Court within ten days of the date when the
Board of Public Works and Safety issued its findings of fact and accompanying
order. An appeal under this division (I)(5) is an action de novo. The court may
affirm, modify or reverse the action taken by the Board of Public Works and
Safety.
   (J)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this
subchapter, discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, or any order or directive issued by the Board of
Public Works and Safety pursuant to this subchapter, the Superintendent, or his
or her designee, may petition a judge of a circuit or superior court of the
county from which the action sought to be restrained or the action sought to be
compelled has arisen, through the City Attorney, for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the discharge permit, order, or other requirements
imposed by this subchapter on activities of the industrial user. Such other
action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by
the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite
to taking any other action against a user.
   (K)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user which has violated or continues to violate this
subchapter, any order or discharge permit issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a civil
penalty of not more than $2,500 per day, per violation for a first violation
nor more than $7,500 per day, per violation for subsequent violations, in
accordance with I.C. 36-1-3-8(a)(10)(B).
      (2)   The city may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city,
including fines, penalties, costs or damages imposed upon the city by the State
of Indiana, EPA or other governmental entities pursuant to this subchapter.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   (L)   Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions set forth in this section are
not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s
enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
   (M)   Service.
      (1)   Any notice of noncompliance, notice of orders, notice of any other
directives issued by the city or by the Board of Public Works and Safety may be
served upon any principle executive, general partner, corporate officer, or the
individual in charge of the user’s wastewater treatment program as designated

the manner in which the service was made, to whom the notice, order or
statement was issued, the nature of the notice, order or statement and the date
of service. The affidavit must be placed on file with the city.
      (3)   If, after reasonable effort, service is not obtained by a means
described above in division (M)(1) above, service may be made by publishing a
notice of the notice, order or statement in each newspaper which the city has
currently designated as a newspaper in which it shall publish legal notices.
Publication may be made on consecutive days. If service of an order is made by
publication, the publication must include a statement indicating generally what
action is required by the notice, order or statement and that the exact terms
of the notice, order or statement may be obtained from the city.
   (N)   Effective date of notice, order or statement. The date when the
notice, order or statement is considered given is as follows:
      (1)   If the notice, order or statement is delivered personally or left
at the usual place of business or employment, notice is considered given on the
day when the notice, order or statement is delivered to the person or left at
the person’s usual place of business or employment.
      (2)   If the notice, order or statement is mailed, notice is considered

§ 51.48 METHODS OF MEASUREMENT TO DETERMINE WATER QUANTITY.
   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the water utility that serves the city shall
be determined by the city in such a manner as the city shall reasonably elect,
and the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except
as hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building other than a
single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly
or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
city, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter,
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to
ascertain the rate or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other
interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the base charge and the consumption rates and charges shall apply
to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (E)   For usage billed after September 1, 2009: In the event two or more
dwelling units such as mobile homes, apartments or housekeeping rooms
discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city’s sanitary
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in such case,
billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere herein,
except that an additional units charge shall be added thereto, in the amount of
$3.07 per month per dwelling unit over one served through the single water
meter. In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be
computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available
for rent plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling
unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in
which cooking facilities are provided.
   (F)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city’s
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable
to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (G)   (1)   In order that the domestic and residential users of sewage
service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the months of May,
June, July, August, September, and October, the billings for residences and/or
domestic users for the months of May, June, July, August, September, and
October shall be based on the average water usage billed for the previous
billed months of November, December and January. Averages resulting in
fractions of 100 gallons shall be raised to the next whole number of 100
gallons. In the event the water usage for the previous billed months of
November, December and January is greater than the water usage for the months
of May, June, July, August, September, and October, then the billing for sewage
services shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for which the
sewage service bill is being rendered.
      (2)   Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building
which is occupied and used as a residence. The sprinkling rate shall not apply
to any premises which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial
purposes. In the event a portion of the premises shall be used for commercial
or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the
water service so that the residential portion of the premises is serviced
through a separate meter and in such case the water usage as registered by the
water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes
would qualify under the sprinkling rate.

§ 51.49 CHARGES BASED ON VOLUME, STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF WASTE DISCHARGED.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-
normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of.
The city shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all
sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary
sewage system, in such manner, by such method, and at such times as the city
may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of
the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a
central sampling point available to the city at all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a carbonaceous
biochemical oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, ammonia in
excess of 20 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess of 250

§ 51.50 MANNER OF BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   The rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city in
the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the portion of the total
billing charged for operation, maintenance and replacement for that user during
the preceding year.
   (B)   (1)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in
the event payment is not made as herein required.
      (2)   The owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for
the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by the tenant or
tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which
such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for
business.
   (C)   As provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid within 15 days
of the billing date are declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the
amount of the rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto.
   (D)   The city shall assess an additional fee of $30 for the filing of a
sewer lien upon any real property, including the recording of a notice of
intent to hold lien.

§ 51.51 SPECIAL RATE CONTRACTS.
   The Board is hereby further authorized to enter into special rate contracts
with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable reduction in cost to
the sewage works can be determined, and the reduction shall be limited to such
reduced costs.
('79 Code, § 17-111) (Ord. 108-1987, passed 11-10-87; Am. Ord. 18-2001, passed

§ 51.52 SPECIAL RATES AND CHARGES.
   Any special rates and charges whether tax fees or supplemental monthly
charges imposed for the purpose of paying for improvements within any special
areas which have been or may hereafter be imposed by several ordinances
applicable to a specific area shall remain effective and shall be in addition
to rates and charges as above set forth in this subchapter.

§ 51.53 AREA TO BE ADDITIONALLY CHARGED.
   Since local sewers are under the applicable state laws, the financial
responsibility of the owners of property to be served by them and such sewers
are needed to be installed by the city in order to provide such service, it is
necessary to establish certain sewer and additional charges to be paid by the
owners of property to be connected to the Rochester Sewage Disposal System
located in the following described area: The area set forth in Section A-2 of
the plans and specifications for sewage works improvements for the city as
prepared by Philip L. Schnelker and Associates of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and
dated April 7, 1987, which plans and specifications are incorporated herein by
reference.
('79 Code, § 17-151) (Ord. 114-1987, passed 11-10-87)
§ 51.54 MONTHLY AVERAGE CALCULATION.
   (A)   The monthly average shall be calculated consistent with the current
practices as follows:
      (1)   The city shall collect 24-hour proportional composite samples of
the user’s discharge for at least seven days within any monthly period.
      (2)   The weighted average of the daily sample results shall be used to
determine the monthly average.
   (B)   The monthly average is intended to measure the average daily flow (in
MGD) and the average daily loading (in pounds) during the subject month.
(Ord. 18-1997, passed 7-8-99; Am. Ord. 18-2001, passed 11-13-01)
§ 51.55 FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   The city shall use its best efforts to negotiate with large volume
users to secure an appropriate financial contribution to assist in the
construction of improvements to the city's sewage works reasonably required as
a result of the additional discharges of such large volume users, it being the
intent of the city that existing ratepayers shall not subsidize the fixed or
incremental expenses associated with treatment of additional wastewater from a
new or newly expanded facility of a large volume user. If any large volume user
makes such a financial contribution, the city shall be prohibited from charging
such user any rate or charge designed to recoup any capital cost relating to
future capital improvements in the city's sewage works of the same nature as
the improvements for which the financial contribution was secured, but only
during the period comprising the useful life, or if longer the actual life, of
the improvement financed with said contribution. Future capital improvements to
the city's sewage works shall be deemed to be of the "same nature" as the
improvements for which the financial contribution was secured when the intent
or the effect of the future capital improvements is to expand or increase the
then existing treatment capacities of the city's sewage works for flow or
loadings that are not attributable to such large volume users. However, the
user making such financial contribution in aid of construction shall be subject
to other noncapital charges associated with the improvements, including
operation, repair, and maintenance.

§ 51.56 STUDY TO REVIEW FAIRNESS, EQUITY AND PROPORTIONALITY OF RATES AND
CHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain
fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of provided services to the
various user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made within a
reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation, following
the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall include,
but not be limited to, an analysis of the cost associated with the treatment of
excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow
rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the
financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to
provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt
service requirements and capital improvements to the sewage treatment systems.
   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time
following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness, equity and proportionality
of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of
certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms
shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city shall
determine to be best under the circumstances. The city shall, upon completion
of the study, revise and adjust the rates and charges, as necessary, in
accordance therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency
of the rates.

MGD) and the average daily loading (in pounds) during the subject month.
(Ord. 18-1997, passed 7-8-99)
§ 51.77 SURCHARGES.
   (A)   In additional to all existing rates and charges of the sewage works
(treatment rate and base rate), any Class II user shall be subject to the
following surcharges:
      (1)   Rate surcharged based upon suspended solids.  There shall be an
additional charge of six cents per pound of suspended solids for suspended
solids received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.

      (3)   The sewer charge penalty will be calculated, applied, and collected
monthly and will apply when the user exceeds any category established in this
division (C).
   (D) The determination of suspended solids, five day carbonaceous biochemical
oxygen demand, COD and ammonia contained in the waste shall be in accordance
with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water,
Sewage and Industrial Waste" as written by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Federation, and in conformance with "Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants," 40 CFR part 136.
(Ord. 18-1997, passed 7-8-99)
§ 51.78 FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   The city shall use its best efforts to negotiate with large volume
users to secure an appropriate financial contribution to assist in the
construction of improvements to the city's sewage works reasonably required as
a result of the additional discharges of such large volume users, it being the
intent of the city that existing ratepayers shall not subsidize the fixed or
incremental expenses associated with treatment of additional wastewater from a
new or newly expanded facility of a large volume user. If any large volume user
makes such a financial contribution, the city shall be prohibited from charging
such user any rate or charge designed to recoup any capital cost relating to
future capital improvements in the city's sewage works of the same nature as
the improvements for which the financial contribution was secured, but only
during the period comprising the useful life, or if longer the actual life, of
the improvement financed with said contribution.
   (B)   Future capital improvements to the city's sewage works shall be deemed
to be of the "same nature" as the improvements for which the financial
contribution was secured when the intent or the effect of the future capital
improvements is to expand or increase the then existing treatment capacities of
the city's sewage works for flow or loadings that are not attributable to such
large volume users. However, the user making such financial contribution in aid
of construction shall be subject to other noncapital charges associated with
the improvements, including operation, repair, and maintenance.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, the city shall not be
prohibited from charging a large volume user which has made a financial
contribution as described in divisions (A) and (B) above, any cost or expense
associated with (i) the treatment of substances discharged in wastewater other
than the substances described in §
51.77, and (ii) a decrease in the permissible loading levels for the substances
described in §
51.77, to the extent federal or state statutes or regulations governing
wastewater treatment are modified.
   (D)   If the city shall fail to follow the policies set out in divisions (A)
and (B) above, by repeal of such subsection or future amendments, the financial
contribution made by a large volume user which is affected by such repeal or
amendment shall be reimbursed to such large volume user, to the extent
permitted by law. Such reimbursement shall be appropriated by the Common
Council within 12 months of such repeal or future amendment and shall either be
paid out of the sewage works net revenues or from proceeds derived from short-
term or long-term obligations to be issued by the sewage works. Such
reimbursement shall be subject to amortization for the useful life, or the
actual life if longer, of the improvement associated with such financial
contribution and shall be subject to the prior payment of any obligations
payable from the net revenues of the sewage works.
(Ord. 18-1997, passed 7-8-99)
§ 51.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate any provision of this code for which no
other penalty is set forth shall be subject to the penalty set forth in §
10.99.
   (B)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in §
51.30(A) shall be guilty of a violation and on conviction thereof, shall be
fined in an amount not to exceed $2,500 per day, per violation for the first
violation and up to $7,500 per violation per day for subsequent violations.
Each day in which any violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate
offense.

use of pedestrians a concrete sidewalk not less than five feet in width, and
within the adjacent public right-of-way and parallel and adjacent to the
property lines of such lot or tract. Such sidewalk shall be constructed
according to plans and specifications as defined in the city code. The
specifications as defined in this code shall apply to all properties within the
city unless the topography of the lot or tract together with the topography of
adjacent lots or tract and the nature of the street right-of-way make it
impractical for the construction of a sidewalk as required. (1999)
(Ord. 02-1999, passed 2-23-99; Am. Ord. 01-2017, passed 1-24-17)
§ 96.81 WAIVER - NEW BUILDING.

or tract upon which such a sidewalk presently exists, the requirement for new
construction shall be waived. (1999)
(Ord. 02-1999, passed 2-23-99)
§ 96.82 BUILDING PERMITS.

§ 96.84 DETERMINATE VARIANCE - SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION DEFERRED.
   (A)   Any person subject to the requirements or any person living outside of
the city limits but within the zoning boundaries who believes it impractical to
construct a sidewalk on the lot or tract at present may apply to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for a variance that is determinate with respect to the criteria
for variance and the time period during which such criteria are in effect, and
with respect to the time period during which the variance is effective. The
Board, after notice and hearing may grant a variance if construction of
sidewalks appears impractical based upon, but not limited to, the following
considerations:
      (1)   The adjacent lot or tracts are at present undeveloped, but it
appears that at some future date these lots or tracts will be developed,
increasing the need for sidewalks for the protection and convenience of
pedestrians; or
      (2)   The location of the lot or tract is such that the present
pedestrian traffic does not warrant the construction of sidewalks, but it
appears that in the future the pedestrian traffic may increase; or
      (3)   Uniformity of development of the area would best be served by
deferring sidewalk construction on the lot or tract until some future date.
   (B)   In the event that the Board authorizes a determinate variance, such
variance shall continue in effect until the date at which the Board shall set
to reconsider variances granted under the authority of this section. All such
variances which were granted by the Board shall expire at that time unless an
extension is granted. Should no extension be applied for, or the Board denies
such application for extension, the owner of the lot or tract shall be required
to construct a sidewalk on the lot or tract at that time.
   (C)   Any person who has been granted a determinate variance by the Board
and subsequently transfers to another party any recordable interest in the lot
or tract shall cause such conveyance to be made subject to the variance and
cause the variance to be noted on the instrument of conveyance to be recorded.
   (D)   In the event a variance is granted a five foot easement for future
construction of a five foot sidewalk shall be provided. (1999)

administration of this section.

apply:
      AGRICULTURAL CROPS, INCLUDING HAY AND PASTURE. Shall not be considered as
weeds or other rank vegetation.
      OWNER or LANDOWNER. That individual, corporation, partnership, or other
entity, recorded in the records of the Auditor of Fulton County as the owner of
record for the purpose of being responsible for the payment of property taxes
upon the real estate where weeds or rank vegetation are found to exist.
      RANK VEGETATION. Includes any vegetative growth found growing profusely
and unmanageably in excess of the height restrictions herein provided.
      WEED. Includes any deleterious, unhealthful or noxious vegetative growth
found growing within the city; or any tree, grass, shrub, flower, or vine;
which, from an aesthetic or functional viewpoint, is incompatible with
vegetation found in the vicinity, or which presents a danger to public health
and safety, or which create by their presence a nuisance to surrounding
properties.
   (C)   Violation of this section shall occur when weeds or rank vegetation in
a given location are found to exist in an average height in excess of eight
inches.
   (D)   Owners of real property within the city are required to cut and remove
weeds and other rank vegetation growing upon their property. The owner’s
responsibility shall not be extinguished by reason of real property being
occupied by tenants.
      (1)   Should the owner fail to cut and remove such weeds and rank
vegetation, or fail to cause such cutting and removal to be accomplished, and
should such weeds and rank vegetation exceed the height restriction set out in
division (C) above, the Department shall issue a written notice to the owner
ordering such cutting and removal. Such notices shall be served upon the
landowner by sending such notice to the landowner by certified mail, first
class mail or the equivalent service permitted under I.C. 1-1-7-1 addressed to
the owner’s last known address by a sworn officer of the city. The notice shall
specify the vegetation to be removed and shall establish time parameters for
completion of the cutting and removal. In no case shall the time allowed to
bring the property into compliance be less than five days from the date upon
which the notice is mailed.
      (2)   If an initial notice of the violation of this section was provided
by certified mail, first class mail or equivalent service the city may also
include a continuous abatement notice posted at the property at the time of
abatement instead of requiring additional notice by certified mail. A
continuous abatement notice serves as notice to the real property owner that
each subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial notice of
the violation was provided may be abated by the city or its contractors.
   (E)   If the landowner fails to cut and remove the vegetation within the
time prescribed in the written notice, the city, or contractors under contract
to the city to provide cutting and removal services, may enter upon real
property to abate the violations of this section found to exist upon the real
property, as described in the notice letter previously issued.
   (F)   In cases where cutting and removal of weeds or other rank vegetation
is accomplished by the city, or by contractors under contract to the city, the
Department in charge of administering this section shall make a certified
statement of the actual cost incurred by the city to abate the violation. Such
costs may include charges for the removal and for administrative costs related
thereto. The statement shall be delivered to the owner of the property by
certified mail, addressed to the landowner’s last known address, and the owner
shall pay the amount so charged to the office of the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (G)   If the landowner fails to pay the amount within ten days after
receiving the statement of costs referenced in division (F) above, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall certify to the County Auditor the amount of the bill, plus any
additional administrative costs incurred in the certification. The Auditor
shall place the total amount certified on the tax duplicate for the property
affected, and the total amount, including accrued interest, shall be collected
as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to the general fund of
the city.
   (H)   Should any notice or statement required to be served upon a landowner
by certified mail under this section be returned as undeliverable or refused,
the city may cause the same to be served by a law enforcement officer of the
city, who shall make his or her return upon such service. The provisions for
service of required notices and statements set out in this division are
supplemental to the provisions set out elsewhere in this section, and are
intended to authorize the use of personal service at the city’s option where
reason exists to believe that personal service may be achieved on the landowner
after service by mail has proved to be unsuccessful. Nothing in this division
shall be construed as requiring the city to attempt such service as a
precondition to abating the violation, provided that the attempt to make
service by certified mail has been made.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Rochester does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 04-2008, passed 6-24-08; Am. Ord. 02-2012, passed 4-24-12; Am. Ord. 07-
2016, passed 8-23-16)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 04-2008, passed 6-24-08; Am. Ord. 02-2012, passed 4-24-12; Am. Ord. 07-
2016, passed 8-23-16)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the county by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 04-2008, passed 6-24-08; Am. Ord. 02-2012, passed 4-24-12; Am. Ord. 07-
2016, passed 8-23-16)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.

§ 153.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES, flood
waters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as ZONE A, ZONE AE, ZONES A1-A30,
ZONE AO, ZONE AH, ZONE AR and ZONE A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).
      (1)   A structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less that is
located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use
of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
      (2)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.

develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.

involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FTA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The Fulton County Plan Commission office and
staff.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. (As related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC COVERAGE.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA), LETTER OF MAP REVISION
(LOMR), and LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929 is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993 is a

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with
the letter A is subject to the 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. (See REGULATORY FLOOD.)
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,

where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
153.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
county subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city are
generally identified as such on the Fulton County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 16, 2012 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
SHADED X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 100-year flood). UNSHADED X ZONES (C Zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. (See definition for A ZONE.)
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen
fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
   (A)   Application stage.
      (1)   A description of the proposed development.
      (2)   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams.
      (3)   A legal description of the property site.
      (4)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades.
      (5)   Elevation of the top of the planned lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD.
      (6)   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed.
      (7)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted to DNR for
approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See §
153.22(B)(6) for additional information.)
   (B)   Construction stage. Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an
elevated structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of
the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted.
The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any
further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the surveyor failure to
make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order
for the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation
certification shall be at the applicant’s risk. Upon establishment of the
floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing
certificate. Certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a registered professional engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the floodproofing certification submitted.) The
applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such review before any
further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing
certification or failure to make correction required shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an elevation
certification (FEMA Elevation Certificate Form 81-31 or any future updates)
which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is required to be submitted
to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project includes a floodproofing
measure, floodproofing certification (FEMA Floodproofing Certificate Form 81-65
or any future updates) is required to be submitted by the applicant to the
Floodplain Administrator.

§ 153.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of §
153.30, all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of any structure having a floor area
greater than 120 square feet.
      (2)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land).
      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred.
      (4)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days.
      (5)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This division (A)(5) does not apply to returning the
existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was
removed to avoid flood damage.
      (6)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
      (7)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous addition or improvement constructed since the community’s first
floodplain ordinance.
   (B)   Residential structures. New construction or substantial improvement of
any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor;
including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood
elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of division (D)
below.
   (C)   Non-residential structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
division (D) below. Structures located in all A Zones may be floodproofed in
lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:
      (1)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator as set forth in §
153.22(B)(12).
      (2)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention
and without an outside source of electricity.
   (D)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG. Elevated
structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs must
meet the following minimum criteria:
      (1)   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
everyone square foot of enclosed area).
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above the
exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions.
      (4)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (5)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
      (6)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation
at or higher than the exterior grade.
      (7)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction in
the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
      (8)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of this division (D). Periodic inspections will be
conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit
shall be recorded in the office of the Fulton County Recorder.
      (9)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the
lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be

§ 153.33 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and

§ 153.34 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFRAs, established in §
153.07, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing, paving
and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
153.30 through
153.37 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all city initiated and/or mandated projects involving channel
modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and
request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory
flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.

2016, passed 8-23-16)
§ 153.35 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
153.30 through
153.37 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.

§ 153.36 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
153.30 through
153.37 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
153.30 through
153.37 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.

§ 153.48 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
153.34 or §
153.36(A) may be granted.
   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
153.34 or §
153.36(A) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
   (D)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
153.31, may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (see §
153.49 ).
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see §

§ 153.49 VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice by the Floodplain Administrator that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood
protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the variance
applicant in the Office of the Fulton County Recorder and shall be recorded in
a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
