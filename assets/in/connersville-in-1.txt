   (A)   An ordinance, order, or resolution passed by the Common Council is
considered adopted when it is signed by the presiding officer; and either
approved by the Mayor or passed over the Mayor’s veto by the Common Council,
under IC 36-4-6-16. If required by statute, an adopted ordinance, order, or
resolution must be promulgated or published before it takes effect.
   (B)   An ordinance prescribing a penalty or forfeiture for a violation must,
before it takes effect, be published in the manner prescribed by IC 5-3-1,

each of the districts from which members are elected to the Common Council.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (E) below, if the city publishes any of
its ordinances in book or pamphlet form, no other publication is required. If
an ordinance prescribing a penalty or forfeiture for a violation is published
under this division, it takes effect two weeks after the publication of the
book or pamphlet. Publication under this division, if authorized by the Common
Council, constitutes presumptive evidence of the ordinances in the book or
pamphlet; of the date of adoption of the ordinances; and that the ordinances
have been properly signed, attested, recorded, and approved.
   (D)   This section, other than division (F) below, does not apply to a

a comprehensive plan, that is adopted under IC 36-7.

Common Council in accordance with IC 5-3-1; and
      (2)   Delay the implementation of the fee increase for 90 days after the
date the ordinance is published under division (E)(1).
   (F)   Subject to division (J), the Common Council shall:
      (1)   Subject to division (G) of this section give written notice to the
Department of Environmental Management not later than 60 days before amendment
or repeal of an environmental restrictive ordinance; and
      (2)   Give written notice to the Department of Environmental Management
not later than 30 days after passage, amendment, or repeal of an environmental
restrictive ordinance.
   (G)   Upon written request by the Common Council, the Department of
Environmental Management may waive the notice requirement of division (F)(1) of
this section.
   (H)   An environmental restrictive ordinance passed or amended after 2009 by
the Common Council must state the notice requirements of division (F) of this
section.
   (I)   The failure of an environmental restrictive ordinance to comply with
division (H) of this section does not void the ordinance.
   (J)   The notice requirements of division (F) of this section apply only if
the city received under IC 13-25-5-8.5(f) written notice that the Department is
relying on the environmental restrictive ordinace referred to in division (F)
as part of a risk based remediation proposal:
      (1)   Approved by the Department; and
      (2)   Conducted under IC 13-22, 13-23, 13-24, 13-25-4, or 13-25-5.
(IC 36-4-6-14)

prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect
and are saved.

ordinances passed subsequent to this code may be numbered in accordance with
the numbering system of this code and printed for inclusion herein. Any
chapter, section, or division repealed by subsequent ordinances may be excluded

§ 31.12 INVOCATION POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. This policy is intended to provide criteria, guidelines, and
procedures for a religious invocation to be offered at City Council meetings
and Board of Public Works meetings in order to solemnize the proceedings of the
City Council and Board of Public Works, and to ensure the city’s practice of
allowing an invocation is in compliance with Supreme Court rulings. As such,
secular invocations are not permitted.
   (B)   Scope. This policy affects elected officials and the regular council
meeting schedule of the City Council and the regular meeting of the Board of
Public Works.
   (C)   Responsibilities. The City Administrator or their designee is
responsible for the implementation and update of this policy. The City Council
and Board of Public Works is responsible for the enforcement of this policy.
   (D)   Timing. After the “Call to Order” and approval of the City Council and
Board of Public Works agenda of all regular meetings of the City Council and
Board of Public Works, an opening invocation as described herein shall occur
followed directly by the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The opening
invocation and recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance will occur and be
completed during the opening, ceremonial portion of the City Council meeting
and Board of Public Works meeting and shall in no event occur, or be construed
to occur, during the policymaking or legislative portions of the City Council
meeting.
   (E)   Policy. The City Council and Board of Public Works, in relation to the
invocation, invites and welcomes the religious leaders of any and all local
religions, including but not limited to ministers, priests, chaplains, rabbis,
deacons, clerics, imams, elders, and the like (hereinafter “invocation
speakers”) to participate in providing invocations for the City Council and
Board of Public Works. The following shall apply as the city’s policy when it
comes to the invocation.
      (1)   No member of the City Council or Board of Public Works, employee of
the City, any city consultant, or any other person in attendance at the meeting
shall be required to participate in any invocation that is offered, and their
presence, or lack thereof, when the invocation is delivered will have no impact
on their observation or participation in any aspect of the meeting, nor shall
be grounds for any censure or removal from the council or employee discipline.
It is also not appropriate to suggest that a Council member, or anyone in
attendance at the meeting, who is uncomfortable with the invocation or who
wishes not to participate should leave during that portion of the meeting.
      (2)   The invocation shall be voluntarily delivered by an eligible member
of the clergy or religious leader within the county. To ensure that such person
is selected from among a wide pool of religious leaders in the community, on a
rotating basis, the invocation speaker will be selected according to the
procedure noted in division (F) below.
      (3)   No invocation speaker shall receive compensation for his or her
service.
      (4)   Speakers should not proselytize or otherwise promote any doctrine,
faith, belief, or dogma; advocate or campaign for conversion of individuals or
groups or threaten damnation. No invocation shall intentionally disparage the
religious faith or non-religious views of others.
      (5)   Invocation should not exceed three minutes in length.
      (6)   This policy is not intended, and shall not be implemented or
construed in any way, to affiliate the City Council or Board of Public Works
with, nor express the City Council or Board of Public Work’s preference for,
any faith, belief, non-belief, opinion, religion, non-religion, or religious
denomination or lack thereof. Rather, this policy is intended to acknowledge
and express the City Council and Board of Public Work’s respect for the
diversity of religious denominations and non-religious denominations, and
faiths and beliefs represented and practiced among the citizens of the city.
      (7)   Neither the City Council, Board of Public Works, nor staff shall
engage in any inquiry, examination, restriction, review of, or involvement in
the content of any invocation being offered. Statements reflecting ideals
relating to peace and security for the city and nation; safety of our armed
forces, police, firefighters and emergency service personnel; wisdom for the
lawmakers; and justice for the people are encouraged. The City Council and
Board of Public Works asks that prayer givers be sensitive to the diversity of
faiths and beliefs represented throughout the community.
      (8)   If the selected invocation speaker does not appear at the scheduled
meeting, the Mayor may skip the invocation or call for a moment of silence in
special situations.
      (9)   The written agenda document created for the City Council and Board
of Public Works meeting will have the following disclaimer:
      “The invocation is a voluntary expression of the private citizen, to and
for the City Council, and is not intended to affiliate the City Council and
Board of Public Works with, or express the City Council’s and Board of Public
Works preference for; any religious/spiritual organization. The views or
beliefs expressed by the invocation speaker have not been previously reviewed
or approved by the Council, the Board, or staff.”
      (10)   Anyone violating this policy is subject to disqualification from
offering future invocations and will be removed from the database of religious/
spiritual leaders or organizations eligible to give the invocation.
   (F)   Selection and scheduling of speakers. The invocation shall be
voluntarily delivered by an eligible religious leader within the county. To
ensure that such person (invocation speaker) is selected from among a wide pool
of the county religious leaders, on a rotating basis, the invocation speaker
will be selected in accordance with these rules:
      (1)   The City Administrator or their designee shall compile and maintain
a database of the religious congregations (“congregations list”) with an
established presence within the county.
      (2)   The congregations list shall be compiled examining a broad and
diverse pool of religious leaders and other representatives of any and all
local religions, including but not limiting to ministers, priests, chaplains,
rabbis, deacons, clerics, imams, elders, and the like. The database may be
compiled by referencing the list for “churches,” “congregations,” or other
religious assemblies in the annual Yellow Pages phone book(s) published for the
city, “worship service listing” from the local newspaper, research from the
internet, consultation with local chambers of commerce or comparable
organizations, and any other effective method in the discretion of the City
Administrator or their designee. Any such church, congregation, religious
assembly, within the jurisdictional limits of the county not identified within
the database for participation may request inclusion within the database by
written communication to the City Administrator that references the opening
invocation. In addition, any individual that previously held the status as
required under this section, but is now retired, and desires to give a
religious invocation may be deemed eligible.
      (3)   Should a question arise as to the authenticity of a church,
congregation, a religious assembly, other religious group, the City
Administrator shall refer to criteria used by the Internal Revenue Service in
its determination of those organizations that would legitimately qualify for
Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.
      (4)   In recognition of the invocation being for the purpose of the City
Council and Board of Public Works, a City Council member may invite a guest
from within or outside the community to provide the invocation. The Council
member shall provide the guest speaker with a copy of this policy and
guidelines for their review.
      (5)   The database is compiled and used for the purposes of logistics,
efficiency, and equal opportunity for all religious leaders within the county
who choose whether to respond to the City Council’s and Board of Public Works
invitation.
      (6)   The congregations list shall be updated, by reasonable efforts of
the City Administrator or their designee, in September or October of each
calendar year. However, as provided in divisions (F)(2), (3) and (5), names may
be added to the list at any time by written request to the City Administrator.
      (7)   Within 90 days of the effective date of this policy, and on or
about November 1 of each calendar year thereafter, the City Administrator or
their designee shall mail an invitation addressed to the leader (invocation
speaker) of each individual on the congregation list. The invitation shall be
dated at the top of the page, signed by the City Administrator, and read as
follows:
      “Dear Leader or Representative,
      The Connersville City Council and Board of Public Works invites and
welcomes religious leaders of any and all local religions, including but not
limiting to ministers, priests, chaplains, rabbis, deacons, clerics, imams, and
elders within Fayette County to voluntarily offer a religious invocation before
the beginning of its regular city council and Board of Public Works meetings.
      As the leader of one of the religious assemblies in the community, you
are eligible to offer this service at an upcoming meeting of the City Council
and Board of Public Works. This opportunity is voluntary and if you are
interested in offering the invocation, please send a written reply at your
earliest convenience to the Mayor’s Office at the Connersville City Hall, 500
N. Central Ave., Connersville, IN 47331, or by email.
      Invocation speakers are scheduled on a first-come, first-served or other
random selection basis. The dates of the City Council’s and Board of Public
Works scheduled meetings for the upcoming year are listed on the following,
attached page. If you have a preference among the dates, please state that
request in your reply.
      To assist you, the following basic guidelines are offered. In addition, a
copy of the City Council’s and the Board of Public Work’s policy regarding
invocations is attached for your information.
      1.   City Council meetings start at 7:00 p.m. The Board of Public Works
meetings start at 1:00 p.m.
      2.    The City Council and Board of Public Works is the intended
audience, not those in attendance or viewing at home.
      3.    To maintain a spirit of respect and ecumenism, the City Council and
Board of Public Works requests only that the invocation opportunity not be used
as an effort to convert others to the particular faith of the invocation
speaker; nor used to disparage any faith or belief or nonreligious view
different than that of the invocation speaker.
      4.    Statements reflecting ideals relating to peace and security for the
city and nation; safety of our armed forces, police, firefighters and emergency
service personnel; wisdom for lawmakers; and justice for the people are
encouraged.
      On behalf of the City Council of Connersville, I thank you in advance for
considering this invitation.
      Sincerely,
      City Administrator”
      (8)   The respondents to the invitation will be scheduled on a first-
come, first-served or other random selected basis to deliver the invocations.
      (9)   In December of each year, the City Administrator or their designee
will present the calendar of scheduled invocation speakers for regular City
Council and Board of Public Works meetings for the upcoming year to be approved
by the City Council. Any spots left vacant may be filled by the City Council
and Board of Public Works according to division (F)(5) above; left vacant to be
filled at a later time; or simply left open and unfilled (meaning no invocation
will be given).

is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

§ 38.04 NEPOTISM; CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and in
contracting with the city in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws effective
July 1, 2012 known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.
   (B)   On July 1, 2012 the city shall have a nepotism and a contracting with
a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of IC 36-1-20.2
(hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and IC 36-1-21 (hereinafter “Contracting with a
Unit by a Relative Policy”) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The city’s Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July 1,
2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of IC 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein. In
addition a copy of IC 36-1-20.2, Nepotism, in effect on July 1, 2012 is
attached to Ordinance 5375.
   (D)   The city’s Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy is hereby
established effective July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements
provisions of IC 36-1-21, and including all future supplements and amendments

fully set out herein. In addition a copy of the IC 36-1-21, Contracting with a
Unit by a Relative, in effect on July 1, 2012 is attached to Ordinance 5375.
   (E)   The city finds that both IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21 specifically
allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or detailed” and
that more detailed are necessary.
   (F)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he or she will
not be in the direct line of supervision. See IC 36-4-6-11 and IC 36-5-2-9.4.
   (G)   The city finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the city cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the city are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the Contracting with Unit by a Relative
Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including termination,
of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed official of the
city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of either the Nepotism Policy or
the Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy maybe subject to action allowed
by law.
   (K)   (1)   The polices created by this section are hereby directed to be

DRUG-FREE POLICY FOR CITY EMPLOYEES
§ 38.15 POLICY.
   (A)   Overview. The city makes a commitment to provide employees a safe
working environment, to ensure that employees, equipment and operating
practices comply with health and safety standards, and to maintain public
confidence in the city and its employees. Since the city values each employee,
the city offers employees assistance in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse
problems.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   The city requires all employees to report for work in a condition
that allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner.
Employees will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol or with
prohibited drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
      (2)   Violation of any provision of this policy will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action
up to and including discharge.
      (3)   This section and related procedures may be modified by the city at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws or
to better serve the needs of the city.
   (C)   Prohibited drugs.
      (1)   Prohibited drugs are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
8120 and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. 1308.11-1308.15) and
prescription controlled substance which have not been prescribed by a licensed
physician or dentist for specific treatment purposes for the employee. Abuse of
prescription or over-the-counter drugs will also be treated as a substance
abuse problem under this policy.
      (2)   This policy prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer,
distribution, possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other
controlled substances while on the job or on city premises (including vehicles
used for city business). These include but are not limited to marijuana,
cocaine, crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
barbiturates. Any illegal substances found on such premises will be turned over
to the state police and may iead for to criminal prosecution.
   (D)   Alcohol.
      (1)   The use of alcohol on the job or on city premises is prohibited,
unless such use is non-abusive and is part of an authorized official event held
off city premises. The use of alcohol in vehicles used for city business is
strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Alcohol possession applies to all open or unsealed alcoholic
beverage containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on city
premises, unless their possession is part of an authorized official event.
Possession of such containers in vehicles used for city business is never
authorized.
   (E)   Reporting violations.
      (1)   Employees must as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this policy and report any conviction to the city under a criminal drug statute
for violations occurring on or off city premises when conducting city business.
Report of a conviction must be made to the city within five business days after
the conviction. The city will then notify the appropriate contracting officer
within ten days after receiving notice from either the employee or from another
source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of
1988.)
      (2)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal drug activity
may be considered in violation of this policy. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the city will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including but not limited to any adverse
effect the employee's actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the city's reputation and image.
      (3)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be
directed to the Clerk- Treasurer.
   (F)   Employee rehabilitation.
      (1)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility and it is
the individual's responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the city will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
      (2)   Employees with a personal, alcohol or drug related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
      (3)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to employment nor a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not
be disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this policy or any other city policies or job requirements.
      (4)   Any employee identified through a city investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
      (5)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the
course of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline.)
   (G)   Testing.
      (1)   The city may ask employees to submit to random alcohol or drug
tests.
      (2)   Alcohol or drug tests will be required for employees in the
following circumstances:
         (a)   When unsatisfactory job performance or other employee behavior
is reasonably indicative of substance abuse.
         (b)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol
rehabilitation program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the
city.
         (c)   When required by law.
      (3)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/
or job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor
(with the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
city. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
      (4)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the city. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.

(Ord. 3308, passed 11-7-94)
ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY
§ 38.30 ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY AND TESTING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   This alcohol and drug abuse policy is designed to ensure that
employees are fit for duty and is adopted because it is the desire of the city
to assure the safety of its citizens and its employees. The city believes that
its employees in safety sensitive positions cannot safely operate vehicles
while under the influence of any controlled substance or while under the
influence of alcohol. This policy applies to all employees who perform safety
sensitive jobs, including mechanics and employees who are required to hold a
Commercial Drivers License (CDL), to perform their job function. This policy
covers truck drivers, mechanics, heavy equipment operators, and any other
positions that require a commercial drivers license. Safety sensitive employees
are expected and required to be in suitable mental and physical condition while
at work, performing their jobs satisfactorily and behaving appropriately. When
an employee fails to meet these expectations and uses alcohol or other drugs in
violation of this policy, that employee should experience disciplinary action.
It is for this purpose that the city has implemented the following Substance
Abuse Policy which includes testing for the presence of drugs and alcohol. The
intent of the city is to also ensure that the city is in compliance with
federal law.
   (B)   This policy addresses the use of alcohol and illegal drugs or
substances on many fronts. The use, possession, sale, purchase or transfer of
unauthorized or illegal drugs or substances, or the abuse or misuse of legal
drugs on city property, while on city business or while operating vehicles and
equipment, is prohibited. Drinking alcoholic beverages resulting in having any
measurable amount of alcohol, as defined in the federal regulations, in an
employee’s system during working hours is prohibited, whether on or off city
property. Working hours include all breaks. Off- duty use of drugs and alcohol
is prohibited to the extent it affects an employee’s attendance or performance
and his or her ability to pass required DOT alcohol and controlled substance
tests. Any violation of this policy is grounds for discipline, up to and
including termination.
   (C)   Physician-directed use of drugs can affect behavior and performance.
When such use of drugs adversely affects job performance or safety, it is in
the best interest of the driver, coworkers, the public, and the city that the
driver take sick or vacation days, or if necessary, unpaid leave in accordance
with the Personnel Policy.
   (D)   The city reserves the right to terminate any employee in a safety
sensitive position who violates the City Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy.
Reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or non- prescribed drugs or
using alcohol or non-prescribed drugs while on the job are listed as cause for
discipline up to and including immediate dismissal in the personnel policies.
The Department Manager or his or her designee is authorized to implement this
policy and program, including a periodic review of the program to address any
problems, changes, or revisions of it, and is instructed to maintain all
records required by the federal regulations. The Department Manager or his or
her designee is responsible for communicating this policy to all employees in
safety sensitive positions and is accountable for its consistent enforcement.
(Ord. 3508, passed 11-4-96)
§ 38.31 REGULATIONS; TESTING OF SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES AND THOSE EMPLOYEES
WHO ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD A CDL LICENSE.
   (A)   All safety sensitive employees will be tested for alcohol and drug
abuse in accordance with the approved procedures when directed by the Depart-
ment Manager or his or her designee. The city will specify the testing site and
provide tests and test interpretations at no cost to employees.
   (B)   Drivers will be tested under the following guidelines:
      (1)   Pre-employment. Under no circum- stances will an individual be
placed in a safety sensitive position without proof of a successful completion
of a drug test. Any individual who refuses to submit to such test, or has a
positive controlled substance test result, as defined by the federal
regulations, will not be considered for employment with the city.
      (2)   Random.
         (a)   A minimum rate of 50% of employees in safety sensitive positions
shall be tested annually for drugs and 25% of employees in these positions
shall be tested annually for alcohol.
         (b)   Random drug and alcohol testing may be combined. For example,
when testing at 50% drug random rate and 25% alcohol random rate, half of the
randomly selected drivers chosen for testing would be tested for both drugs and
alcohol, while the rest could be tested only for drugs. Alcohol testing will be
conducted just prior to, during, or immediately following performance of a
safety sensitive function.
         (c)   Random testing selection requires:
            1.   Use of all involved employees in each pool;
            2.   Use of valid random selection process;
            3.   Unannounced dates for testing; and
            4.   Testing of 50% of drivers for drugs and 25% of drivers for
alcohol.
      (3)   Post accident.
         (a)   Drivers are required to submit to drug and alcohol testing as
soon as possible following any incident which involves the loss of human life,
or the driver receives a citation under the state or local law for a moving
traffic violation arising from the accident, or one or more vehicles is towed
from the scene as a result of the accident.
         (b)   A driver who is subject to post accident testing shall remain
readily available for such testing. The employee’s failure to remain available
under these circumstances may result in that employee being deemed by the city
to have refused to subject to testing. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to require the delay of necessary medical treatment or to prohibit
the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for a period necessary to
obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary medical
care.
         (c)   No driver required to take a post accident alcohol test shall
use alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes
a post accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first.
         (d)   If a driver is seriously injured and cannot submit to testing at
the time of the accident, he or she shall provide the necessary authorization
for obtaining hospital reports and other documents that would indicate whether
there were any drugs or alcohol in his or her system at the time of the
incident in question.
         (e)   The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, or
a urine test for the use of drugs, conducted by federal, state or local
officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to
meet the requirement for post accident testing.
         (f)   When post accident testing is required, the employee should take
the following actions:
            1.   Attempt to obtain assistance necessary to treat injuries;
            2.   Cooperate with law enforcement in the investigation of the
situation;
            3.   Explain the need for testing to the law enforcement officials
conducting the investigation;
            4.   Work with medical facility to assure that the necessary
testing is completed;
            5.   Collect specimens promptly; and
            6.   Document events.
      (4)   Reasonable suspicion.
         (a)   The city is required to test for the use of alcohol and
controlled substances upon “reasonable suspicion.” Reasonable suspicion is
defined to mean that the city believes the behavior, speech, body odor, or
appearance of an employee while on duty are indicative of the use of alcohol or
controlled substances. The conduct must be witnessed by a supervisor who has
been trained in detection of indices of alcohol or drug use. Supervisors will
receive at least two hours of training to further their knowledge of possible
signs of alcohol or drug use that influence an employee’s fitness for duty. The
mere possession of alcohol does not constitute a need for an alcohol test. The
witness must have received training in the detection of probable alcohol and
drug use by observing a person’s behavior. If it is at all possible, the
witness should not conduct the alcohol test, in order to protect the driver.
         (b)   Alcohol testing is authorized only if the observations are made
during, just before, or just after the period of the work day of the employee.
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a reasonable
suspicion alcohol or controlled substance test. This record is to be signed by
the supervisor who requires a reasonable suspicion test and shall include all
observations that culminated in the test or tests being administered.
         (c)   If a reasonable suspicion alcohol test is not administered
within two hours following the observations, the witness shall prepare and
maintain on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not
administered promptly. In addition, if not administered within eight hours, all
attempts to administer the test shall cease. A record shall be prepared and
maintained stating why the alcohol test was not administered.
         (d)   Prior to the start of work, a driver must report to his or her
immediate supervisor use of any prescription or over the counter drug which may
affect job performance or the safety of others. It is the driver’s
responsibility to obtain from his or her physician a determination as to
whether or not the drug could affect job performance.
         (e)   All information obtained in the course of testing of drivers
shall be protected as confidential medical information. No data concerning this
information will be made a part of the employee’s personnel file nor will it be
provided to any other party without the direct written consent of the driver,
unless the results are grounds for discipline or the grievance procedure is
requested by the employee.
         (f)   Failure to sign a release for alcohol and drug testing will be
classified as refusal to carry out an order of a supervisor and the employee
can be terminated.
         (g)   Refusal to submit to alcohol or controlled substance testing as
required will be recorded as a positive test. Refusal to submit to an alcohol
or controlled substance test means that an employee (1) fails to provide
adequate breath for testing without valid medical explanation after he or she
has received notice of the requirement for breath testing in accordance with
this policy, (2) fails to provide adequate urine for controlled substance
testing without a valid medical explanation after he or she has received notice
of the requirement for testing in accordance with this policy, or (3) engages
in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.
         (h)   As stipulated in the federal regulations, an employee testing
positive for alcohol (.04 or greater) or for a controlled substance shall be
prohibited from driving or performing a safety sensitive function for the city
and referred to the Medical Review Officer. Employees testing .02 or greater,
but less than .04 shall also not drive or perform safety sensitive functions
for the city, nor shall the city permit him or her to perform safety sensitive
functions, until the start of the employee’s next regularly scheduled duty

§ 39.03 CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy (the "policy") is to facilitate
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
   (B)   Classification of assets. Capital assets are personal and real
property used in the operations of the government that have an expected
estimated useful life beyond a single period. Capital assets are to include any
item that falls into one of the following categories:
      (1)   Land;
      (2)   Land improvements;
      (3)   Buildings;
      (4)   Machinery and equipment;
      (5)   Vehicles;
      (6)   Computer software;
      (7)   General infrastructure; or
      (8)   Construction in progress.
   (C)   Classification thresholds.
      (1)   To be considered a capital asset for financial reporting purposes,
an item must be at or above the capitalization threshold and have a unit
historical cost of $5,000 or more. Assets will remain as part of the property
record until they are retired or are disposed of, sold, traded in, etc.
regardless of net book value amount.
      (2)   The capitalization threshold for the following classes of assets
shall be as follows:
         (a)   Land: N/A;
         (b)   Land improvements: $50,000;
         (c)   Building improvements: $100,000;
         (d)   Machinery and equipment: $5,000;
         (e)   Vehicles: $5,000;
         (f)   Computer software: $5,000;
         (g)   General infrastructure improvements: $200,000; and
         (h)   Construction in progress: N/A.
      (3)   With regard to improvements to buildings and general
infrastructure, a capital outlay must be significant and increase capacity,
increase efficiency, or extend the asset's estimated useful life beyond the
original expectation.
      (4)   A change in capacity increases the level of service provided by the
asset. A change in efficiency increases the level of service but without
increasing the size of the asset or the change maintains the same level of
service at a lower cost. For example, an addition to a building provides
increased square footage, hence the capacity is increased and the capital
outlay is capitalized. Widening a road with additional lanes increases capacity
and, hence, the capital outlay is capitalized. An extended estimated useful
life involves a significant alternation, structural change or improvement.
      (5)   While substantial repairs and renovations will be reviewed for
potential capitalization, it is anticipated that most will be expensed in the
current year. These expenses often merely restore the asset to the original
service potential but do not necessarily improve the asset.
      (6)   All land, including rights-of-way, is capitalized at the time of
acquisition regardless of historical costs or fair value if donated.
   (D)   Historical cost or estimated historical costs.
      (1)   Prospective reporting. Capital assets are recorded at historical
cost which includes any ancillary charges necessary to place the asset into its
intended location and condition for use. Ancillary charges include, for
example, freight and transportation charges, site preparation costs, and
professional fees. Engineering costs (internal and external) include related
preliminary project and environmental studies; project estimating, design, and
planning (drawings and specifications); and construction engineering,
construction management, construction inspection and project payment. Donated
capital assets are recorded at their estimated fair value at the time of
acquisition.
      (2)   Retroactive reporting at transition of GASB Statement No. 34. When
actual historical cost source data was unavailable, estimated historical cost
was developed utilizing a normal costing approach. With this method of
estimating historical cost, a current replacement cost was ascertained. An
appropriate cost index (including Consumer Price Index and Federal Highway
Price Trends) corresponding to an estimated date of acquisition/construction
was then applied to 'deflate' the replacement cost to an estimated historical
cost.
   (E)   Estimated useful lives of depreciable assets. Capital assets have
estimated useful lives extending beyond a single reporting period (one year)
and are depreciated using the straight-line method with no allowance for
salvage value. The estimated useful lives currently used were developed with
the input of knowledgeable staff and reflect our government's experience with
these assets:
Land                    Non-depreciable
Land Improvements       20 years
Buildings               50 years
Machinery and Equipment 5 years
Vehicles
   Automobiles       5 years
   Light Trucks      10 years
   Heavy Trucks      15 years
General Infrastructure  20 to 100 years
Computer Software       5 years
 
   (F)   Depreciation method/convention. Depreciation will be calculated using
the straight-line method and full-year convention. No salvage value or residual
value will be recognized.
   (G)   Retirements.
      (1)   Retirements apply to all capital assets including land, buildings,
machinery and equipment, vehicles, and general infrastructure.
      (2)   When an asset is disposed or scrapped, sold, subject to demolition,
etc. it is to be removed from the property record and the appropriate reduction
will be made to historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net book value
amounts.
      (3)   Retirements will reflect the actual historical cost of the asset
when the amount is ascertainable. When historical cost is not ascertainable, an
estimated historical cost will be determined.
   (H)   Responsibility for property record maintenance.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer will ensure that reporting for capital assets
is being exercised by establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially
and periodically in subsequent years. The Clerk-Treasurer will further ensure
that the capital asset report will be updated annually to reflect improvements,
additions, retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital
asset balance for financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated
depreciation calculations and net book value amounts.
      (2)   Day-to-day stewardship of personal property above the
capitalization threshold of $5,000 is the responsibility of the department
utilizing the property.
      (3)   For annual updating of the capital asset report, the departments
have the responsibility to report improvements, additions, retirements, and
transfers in detail to the Clerk-Treasurer. It is expected that this reporting
will be in a timely manner, as the capital asset record must be updated
annually.
      (4)   To restate, additions of assets at or above the unit capitalization
threshold of $5,000 are to be reported to the Clerk-Treasurer by the
departments upon purchase or receipt of the asset. These will be verified per
the claims process by the Clerk-Treasurer's office. Transfers and retirements
of assets at or above the $5,000 unit threshold are to be reported as such by
the departments to the Clerk-Treasurer at the time of the transaction.
   (I)   Property control.
      (1)   Capital assets below the capitalization threshold of $5,000 on a
unit basis but warranting 'control' shall be inventoried at the department
level and an appropriate list will be maintained. Data elements are to include
asset description, location, make, model, serial number, and other information
that assists control or deemed relevant.
      (2)   Assets below the capitalization threshold but considered sensitive
may include, for example, weapons, radios, personal computers, laptop
computers, printers, fax machines, and small power tools. These minor but
sensitive items shall be inventoried and controlled at the department level.
Stewardship of these minor but sensitive items is the responsibility of the
department utilizing these properties.
      (3)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall determine appropriate means, level of
detailed data elements, and the system to be utilized. Finally, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall have the right to request copies of the inventory and/or
updated inventory of controllable items so as to periodically review the
information and adherence to policy.

§ 39.04 COST PRINCIPLES FOR SPENDING FEDERAL FUNDS.
   The following cost principles for spending federal funds be implemented by
the Clerk-Treasurer and followed by the city and its elected and hired
employees, to wit:
   (A)   Implementation. The Clerk-Treasurer is responsible for the efficient
and effective administration of grant funds through the application of sound
management practices. Such funds shall be administered in a manner consistent
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, the associated agreements or
assurances, program objectives and the specific terms and conditions of the
grant award.
   (B)   Cost principles. The total cost of a federal award is the sum of the
allocable direct and allocable indirect costs less any applicable credits.
Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction of expenditure type
transactions that offset or reduce expense items allocable to the federal
award. Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs shall meet the
following general criteria in order to be allowable under federal awards:
      (1)   (a)   Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient
performance and administration of the federal award and be allocable thereto
under these principles. A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it
does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the
circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost.
         (b)   To determine whether a cost is reasonable, consideration shall
be given to:
            1.   Whether a cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary
and necessary for the operation of the city or the proper and efficient
performance of the federal award;
            2.   The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as
sound business practices, arm’s length bargaining, federal, state, local,
tribal and other laws and regulations, and terms and conditions of the federal
award;
            3.   Market prices for comparable goods or services for the
geographic area;
            4.   Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the
circumstances considering their responsibilities to the city, its employees,
the public at large, and the federal government;
            5.   Whether the city significantly deviates from its established
practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs, which may
unjustifiably increase the federal award’s cost.
         (c)   Whether a cost is necessary is determined based on the needs of
the program. The expenditure must be necessary to achieve an important program
objective. A key aspect in determining whether a cost is necessary is whether
the city can demonstrate that the cost addresses an existing need.
         (d)   To determine whether a cost is necessary, consideration may be
given to whether:
            1.   The cost is needed for the proper and efficient performance of
the grant program;
            2.   The cost is identified in the approved budget or application;
            3.   There is a benefit to the city or its citizens associated with
the cost;
            4.   The cost aligns with identified needs based on results and
findings from a needs assessment; and
            5.   The cost addresses program goals and objectives and is based
on program data.
         (e)   A cost is allocable to the federal award or other cost objective
if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to the federal
award or cost objective in accordance with relative benefits received. This
standard is met if the cost:
            1.   Is incurred specifically for the federal award;
            2.   Benefits both the federal award and other work of the city and
can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable
methods; and
            3.   Is necessary to the overall operation of the city and is
assignable in part to the federal award in accordance with the foregoing cost
principles.
      (2)   Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these cost
principles or in the federal award as to types or amount of cost items.
      (3)   Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to
both federally-financed and other activities of the city.
      (4)   Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a
federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose
in like circumstances has been allocated to the federal award as an indirect
cost.
      (5)   Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
      (6)   Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching
requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a
prior period, unless specifically authorized by the federal award.
      (7)   Be adequately documented:
         (a)   With respect to personal services, the Clerk-Treasurer shall
implement a system for city personnel to account for time and efforts expended
on grant funded programs to assure that only permissible personnel expenses are
allocated;
         (b)   All other costs receipts and other invoice materials shall be
retained, along with any documentation identifying the need and purpose for
each expenditure if not otherwise clear.
      (8)   (a)   Be incurred during the approved budget period.
         (b)   The BUDGET PERIOD means the time interval from the start date of
a funded portion of an award to the end date of that funded portion during
which recipients are authorized to expend the funds awarded, including any
funds carried forward or other revisions pursuant to law. Prior written
approval from the federal awarding agency or state pass-through entity may be
required to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods
unless waived.
   (B)   Selected items of cost. The city shall follow the rules for selected
items of cost at 2 C.F.R Part 200, Subpart E when charging these specific
expenditures to a federal grant. When applicable, City staff shall check costs
against the selected items of cost requirements to ensure the cost is
allowable. In addition, state, city and program-specific rules, including the
terms and conditions of the award, may deem a cost as unallowable, and city
personnel shall follow those rules as well.
   (C)   Cost compliance. The Clerk-Treasurer shall require that grant program
funds are expended and are accounted for consistent with the requirements of
the specific program and as identified in the grant application. Compliance
monitoring includes accounting for direct or indirect costs and reporting them
as permitted or required by each grant. Costs incurred for the same purpose in
like circumstances shall be treated consistently as either direct or indirect
costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both.
   (D)   Determining whether a cost is direct or indirect.
      (1)   (a)   DIRECT COSTS are those costs that can be identified
specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a federal award,
or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly
assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.
Identification with the federal award rather than the nature of the goods and
services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from
indirect costs of federal awards.
         (b)   Typical costs charged directly to a federal award are the
compensation of employees who work on that award, their related fringe benefit
costs, the costs of materials and other items of expense incurred for the
federal award. If directly related to a specific award, certain costs that
otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct
costs. Examples include extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of
materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities,
program evaluation costs, or other institutional service operations.
      (2)   (a)   INDIRECT COSTS are those costs incurred for a common or joint
purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to
the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to
the results achieved.
         (b)   These costs may include general data processing, human
resources, utility costs, maintenance and accounting and other costs of that
nature.
         (c)   The salaries of administrative and clerical staff should
normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be
appropriate only if all of the following conditions are met:
            1.   Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project
or activity;
            2.   Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the
project or activity;
            3.   Such costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the
prior written approval of the federal awarding agency; and
            4.   The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.
   (E)   Timely obligation of funds.
      (1)   FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, when referencing a recipient’s or
subrecipient’s use of funds under a federal award, means orders placed for
property and services, contracts and subawards made, and similar transactions
that require payment. The following illustrates when funds are determined to be
obligated.
      (2)   If the obligation is for:
         (a)   Acquisition of property - on the date when the city makes a
binding written commitment to acquire the property;
         (b)   Personal services by an employee of the city - when the services
are performed;
         (c)   Personal services by a contractor who is not an employee of the
city - on the date when the city makes a binding written commitment to obtain
the services;
         (d)   Performance of work other than personal services - on the date
when the city makes a binding written commitment to obtain the work;
         (e)   Public utility services - when the city receives the services;
         (f)   Travel - when the travel is taken;
         (g)   Rental of property - when the city uses the property;
         (h)   A properly approved pre-agreement cost - on the first day of the
project period.
   (F)   Period of performance.
      (1)   PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE means the total estimated time interval
between the start of an initial federal award and the planned end date, which
may include one or more funded portions, or budget periods. The PERIOD OF
PERFORMANCE is dictated by statute and will be indicated in the grant award
notification. As a general rule, state administrated federal funds are
available for obligation within the year for which Congress appropriated the
funds. Any obligations under a grant may not be made until the grant funding
period begins or all necessary materials are submitted to the granting agency,
whichever is later. In the case of a direct grant, obligations may begin when
the grant is approved, unless an agreement exists with the State Board of
Accounts or the pass-through entity to reimburse for pre-approved expenses.
      (2)   Unless the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity
authorizes an extension, the city must liquidate all financial obligations
incurred under the federal award no later than 120 calendar days after the end
date of the period of performance as specified in the terms and conditions of
the federal award.
      (3)   The city must promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that
the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity paid in advance or paid and
that are not authorized to be retained by the city for use in other projects.
   (G)   Validity of policy. This Cost Principles for Spending Federal Funds
Policy is and shall be valid upon adoption and publication as required by law
and shall remain valid indefinitely.

depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.
   (B)   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No
interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private,
auxiliary, or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply
of the city may enter the supply or distribution system of said municipality,
unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the City
Utilities and by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Board of Works and the City Utilities to
cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water
system where cross connections with the public water system is deemed possible.
The frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on potential health
hazards involved shall be established by the Board of Works and the City
Utilities.
   (D)   Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the City
Utilities shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to
examine the property served by a connection to the public water system of the
city for cross connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed
evidence of the presence of cross connections.
   (E)   The City Utilities is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this
section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary
to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water
service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on the
owner, lessee, or occupants of the property or premises where a violation is
found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this section.
   (F)   If it is deemed by the City Utilities that a cross connection or an
emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk of the
city and delivered to the consumer's premises, service may be immediately
discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for hearing within ten
days of such emergency discontinuance.
   (G)   All consumers using toxic or hazardous liquids, all hospitals,
mortuaries, wastewater treatment plants, laboratories, and all other hazardous
users install and maintain a reduced pressure principal backflow preventer in
the main water line serving each building on the premises. The backflow
preventer must be installed in an easily accessible location not subject to
flooding or freezing.
   (H)   The reduced pressure principle backflow preventers shall not be
installed below ground level.

backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water consumer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his
own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Superintendent of Water and shall have inspections and tests
made of such approved devices as required by the Superintendent of Water and in
accordance with the IDEM Rule 327 IAC 8-10.

§ 51.008 CERTAIN DISCHARGES TO BE APPROVED
   If any sewage is discharged, or proposed to be discharged to the sewage
works which contains the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated
in §
51.006, and which in the judgment of the city utilities, may have a deleterious
effect upon the wastewater treatment works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city utilities may in writing reject the waters, require
pretreatment to an acceptable condition prior to discharge to the sanitary
sewers, require flow equalization of the rate of discharge, or require payment
to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by the
existing sewer service charges. If the city utilities permits the pretreatment
or equalization of waste flows, plans and specifications shall be submitted to
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) for review and
approval. Such plans and specifications shall also be subject to review and
approval by the Board before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and specifications will in no way relieve that person from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the control authority under the provisions of this subchapter.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities shall be reported to and
be acceptable to the control authority.

§ 51.010 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   (A)   The owner of any industry discharging industrial wastewater into the
sewage works in excess of 5% of the design capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant or who is classified as a significant industrial user shall install a
special control manhole on each discharge line to the sewage works. The special
control manhole shall be approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) and the city utilities prior to the installation and be in
accordance with local, state, and federal construction standards and
specifications.
   (B)   Construction shall be completed by the date set and agreed upon by the
control authority and the industrial user unless written authorization for time
extension is otherwise granted by the control authority. The special control
manhole shall provide for future installation of a volume measuring device and
an automatic proportional sampler, if required. The owner shall design,
construct, operate, and maintain the special control manhole at his expense.
The special control manhole shall normally be situated on the private property
of the industry, but if in the judgment of the city utilities, this location is
impractical or causes undue hardship on the control authority or the industry,
this manhole may be constructed in the public right-of-way. Should the
industrial user have valid reasons not to construct a control manhole, the
owner shall, therefore, make a request of the city utilities or a duly
authorized representative of the control authority, in writing, requesting that
a waiver be granted. After an inspection of the industrial user's facility has
been made, a determination shall be made whether to grant said waiver. Should
said waiver be granted, this waiver would be in effect only until such time
that the control authority agrees to.

report or evidence or required by any permit or order, shall be determined by
current methodology as prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 - Guidelines For
Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants and amendments
thereto, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in §
51.010. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not describe sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in
accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. In the event that no special
control manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.012 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   The control authority reserves the right to enter into a special agreement
or arrangement with users that will set special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. No discharge that violates pretreatment standards will
be allowed under the terms of such special agreements. If the wastewater has
the potential to cause pass through or interference or endanger municipal
employees or the public, no special agreement will be made.

(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.041 WASTEWATER VOLUME DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Charges and fees provided for in other ordinances for significant
industrial users or other dischargers of industrial wastes that may be
designated by the city utilities shall be applied against the total amount of
water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges
measured by the water meter for the public water supply there in use, except as
herein otherwise provided.
   (B)   If the total amount of water used by industries in division (A) above
is received from sources other than the public water supply either entirely or
in part, then those industries shall install and maintain a water meter
approved by the city utilities, at their expense on these private water
supplies, except as herein otherwise provided.
   (C)   For those industries where, in the opinion of the city utilities, a
significant portion of the water received from any metered source does not flow
into the community sewer because of the principal activity of the industry or
is removed by other means, the charges and fees will be applied against the
volume of water discharged from such premises into the sewage works. Written
notification and proof of the diversion of water shall be provided by the
industry if the industry is to avoid the application of industry charges and
fees against the total amount of water used from all sources. The industry may
install a volume measuring device in the special control manhole of each
discharge line to the sewage works, provided for in §
51.010, of a type approved by the city utilities. The device shall be designed,
installed, and maintained at the industry's expense. Such devices shall measure
the amount of flow discharged into the sewage works. Such devices shall be
tested for accuracy at the expense of that industry when deemed necessary by
the city utilities. Action to have a volume measuring device install may be
instigated by that industry if it so desires. This device may be installed in
lieu of the water meters required in division (B) above if approved by the city
utilities.
   (D)   Those industries required to install water meters under division (B)
above shall place these meters in service within 180 days after written
notification by the city utilities. Those industries required to install volume
measuring devices required by division (C) above shall place these volume
measuring devices in service within 360 days after written notification by the
city utilities. For every day thereafter that these meters and devices are not
in operation the penalties detailed in §
51.999 shall apply.
   (E)   For industries where, in the opinion of the city utilities, it is
impractical to install water meters or volume measuring devices, the quantity
of sewage or industrial waste may be based upon an estimate prepared by the
city utilities. The estimate shall be based upon a rational determination of
the flow discharged and may consider such factors as the number of fixtures,
seating capacity, population equivalent, annual production of goods or
services, or such other determinations of water use as necessary to estimate
the volume discharged.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)

user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
individual wastewater discharge perrnits or general permits, monitoring
programs, and from the control authority's inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the control authority, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information
should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by
the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and
shall be available to the public without restriction.
      (6)   Modification of a permit. The control authority shall have the
right to modify the industrial user's permit, incorporate newly promulgated

(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.043 GENERAL PERMITS.
   (A)   At the discretion of the control authority, the control authority may
use general permits to control significant industrial users or other users,
discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to
be covered by a general permit must:
      (1)   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
      (2)   Discharge the same types of wastes;
      (3)   Require the same effluent limitations;
      (4)   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
      (5)   In the opinion of the control authority, are more appropriately
controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge
permits.
   (B)   To be covered by the general permit, the user must file a written
request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production
processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all
wastes covered by the general permit, any requests with in accordance with §
51.045(A)(4) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information the control
authority deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the
general permit until after the control authority has provided written notice to
the user that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with §
51.045(A)(4).
   (C)   The control authority will retain a copy of the general permit,
documentation to support the control authority's determination that a specific
user meets the criteria in division (A)(1) through (5) above and applicable
state regulations, and a copy of the user's written request for coverage for
coverage for no less than three years after the expiration of the general
permit.
   (D)   The control authority may not control an SIU through a general permit
where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment
standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant
discharge per day or for users whose limits are based on the combined
wastestream formula in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) or net/gross
calculations (§
51.044(B)).
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.044 DISCHARGE STANDARD PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Dilution.
      (1)   Dilution of the effluent from a treatment works or from any
wastewater source is not acceptable as a method of treatment of wastes in order
to meet the standards set forth herein. Rather, it shall be the obligation of
any person discharging contaminants of any kind to the waters of the state to
provide the best degree of treatment of wastewater consistent with
technological feasibility and economic reasonableness. To determine what kind
of treatment is the "best degree of treatment" within the meaning of this
division, a person shall consider the following:
         (a)   What degree of waste reduction can be achieved by process
change, improved housekeeping, and recovery of individual waste components for
reuse; or
         (b)   Whether individual process wastewater streams could be
segregated or combined.
      (2)   Measurement of contaminant concentrations to determine compliance
with the effluent standards set forth herein shall be made at the point of
discharge to the city's wastewater collection system.
   (B)   Net/gross adjustments. An industrial user may obtain a net/gross
adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the
following divisions:
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make an application to the control authority. Upon request of
the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net"
basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if
the requirements of division (B)(2) of this section are met.
      (2)   Criteria:
         (a)   Either:
            1.   The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in
40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis; or
            2.   The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibihty for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The control authority may waive this requirement if it finds that
no environmental degradation will result.
   (C)   Sampling. Any user subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall submit the results of the sampling and analysis in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.12(g). Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must
be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report and data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicted in divisions (2) and (4) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control
authority as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measures the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40
CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted
to the control authority.
      (4)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §
51.045(B) and (D), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for
facilities which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data is available, the control authority may
authorize a lower minimum. For reports required by §
51.045(A), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
   (D)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. The user is not required to resample if the control authority
monitors at the user's facility at least once per month, or if the control
authority samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of the sampling.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.045 REQUIRED REPORTS.
   (A)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Any significant industrial user, even if they have been designated
a non-significant categorical industrial user, shall submit a periodic
compliance report at a frequency determined by the control authority, but in no
case less than twice per year (June and December). The report shall include the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the SIU must submit documentation required by the
control authority or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the SIU.
The control authority may require any other industrial users discharging or
proposing to discharge into the treatment system to file periodic reports on
the forms provided. All discharge reports must be signed by an authorized
representative of the facility and certified in accordance with §
51.042(B)(13)(a).
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial
user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures
prescribed in §§
51.011 and
51.044(C), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      (4)   The control authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)
provided that the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be submitted to the
control authority with the individual wastewater discharge permit application,
include the certification statement from §
51.042(B)(13)(a), and signed by the industrial user's authorized representative
as defined by §
51.002. See §
51.042(B)(10).
         (b)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (c)   The monitoring waver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
         (d)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. Non-detectable sample
results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if
the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection
level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
         (e)   Any grant of the monitoring waver by the control authority must
be included as a condition in the industrial user's permit.
         (f)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
industrial user's permit by the control authority, the industrial user must
certify on each report with the following statement that there has been no
increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the
industrial user:
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify parts]. I certify
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the
level of [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the
facility since filing of the last periodic report."
         (g)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the industrial
user's operations, the industrial user must immediately comply with the
monitoring requirements of section, or other more frequent monitoring
requirements imposed by the control authority, and notify the control authority
of the presence or expected presence of the pollutant.
         (h)    This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as other
specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (B)   Baseline reports.
      (1)   Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision made on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the
information listed in division (2) below. At least 90 days prior to the
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall submit to the control authority a report which
contains the information listed in division (2) below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. All baseline
reports must be signed and certified by the authorized representative of the
industrial user.
      (2)   The industrial user shall submit the following information to the
control authority:
         (a)   Identifying information. The name and address of the facility
including the name of the operator and owners.
         (b)   Permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or
for the facility.
         (c)   Description of operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of the
operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should
include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the
POTW from the regulated processes.
         (d)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula set out in 403.6(e).
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   Identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process.
            2.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control
authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required)
shall be reported. Samples shall be representative of daily operations. In
cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the control authority, or the applicable standards to determine
compliance with the standard.
            3.   A minimum of one representative sample shall be used to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements.
            4.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measures
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the control authority.
            5.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto and in §§
51.011 and
51.044(C). If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
            6.   The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data as long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
            7.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place,
of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (f)   Certification. A statement reviewed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance
(O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to
meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The compliance schedule
must also meet the requirements set out in §
51.045(C).
   (C)   Categorical industries compliance schedule. Whenever an industrial
user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is not meeting the standards
at the time of promulgation of that standard, a compliance schedule report
shall be filed with the control authority. The schedule shall contain the
increments of progress (i.e., hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing
construction, completing construction, etc.) which correspond to specific dates
for their completion. No increment referred to in the schedule shall exceed
nine months. All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a
progress report to the control authority no later than 14 days following each
date in the compliance schedule and the final date for compliance. This report
must include, at a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment
of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user
to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more
than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority.
   (D)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. Within
90 days following the date for final compliance with an applicable pretreatment
standard, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to those
standards must submit to the control authority a report containing the
information described in division (B)(2)((d) through (f) above. For industrial
users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with the procedure in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the long-term production rate. For all other users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of operation, this
report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. The report shall be signed by a duly authorized representative
of the user and in accordance with §
51.002 and
51.042(B)(13)(a). All sampling will be done in conformance with §
51.044(C).
   (E)   Non-categorical industries compliance schedule. Any non-categorical
industry which is not in compliance with the city's ordinance limitations must
develop a compliance schedule during which time the industry must meet the
ordinance standards. The schedule should contain increments of progress (hiring
engineers, starting construction, etc.) which correspond to specific dates for
completion. These represent major events leading to the operation of the
pretreatment equipment to meet the pretreatment standards. All industrial users
subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the control
authority no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule.
This report must include whether the user with the increment of progress to be
met on that date, reason for the delay if the date was not met, and the steps
being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months
elapse between progress reports.
   (F)   Records retention. All records of wastewater discharges, pretreatment
operations, reports in this section, best management practices, and any other
records that pertain to the industrial pretreatment program shall be retained
by the industrial user and be available for inspection and copying by the
control authority for a period of no less than three years.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.046 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Users must notify the control authority 60 days prior to any significant
facility expansion, production increase, or process modification which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater discharge. No user shall
implement the planned changes until and unless the control authority has
responded to the industrial user's notice.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.047 NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control
authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
action taken. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall submit
a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the
measures taken to prevent similar future occurrences .This notification shall
not relieve the user of liability for damages or for fines or penalties which
may be imposed. Significant industrial users are required to notify the control
authority immediately of any facility changes that affect the potential for a
slug discharge.
(Ord. 6386, passed 3-20-17)
§ 51.048 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the control authority finds that
any user has violated or is violating this chapter or any prohibition,
limitation, or requirement contained herein, a written notice stating the
nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days,
for the satisfactory correction thereof may be served. Unless otherwise stated
in the notice, within ten days of the receipt of the notice, the discharger
must respond personally or in writing to the control authority advising of its
position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties must meet to
determine the seriousness of the allegations and where necessary, establish a
plan for satisfactory correction of the violation.
   (B)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the control
authority may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to
show cause before the Board why service should not be terminated. A notice
shall be served on the offending party specifying the time and place of the
hearing to be held by the Board regarding the violation. The notice shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or
officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence or
may designate any of its members or officers to:
         (a)   Issue in the name of the Board, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in any such hearings;
         (b)   Take evidence; and
         (c)   Transmit a report of evidence and hearing, including transcripts
and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Board for action
thereon.
      (3)   At any public hearing, testimony taken before the Board or any
person designated by it, must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The
transcript or any part of the hearing, so recorded, will be made available to
any member of the public upon payment of the usual charges.
      (4)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the party responsible for the discharge that, following a specified time
period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated. The Board may
issue such further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate.
   (C)   Legal action. Any discharge in violation of the substantive provisions
of this chapter or an order of the Board shall be considered a public nuisance.
If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
sewage works contrary to the substantive provisions of this ordinance or any
order of the Board, the City Attorney shall commence an action to seek or
assess civil or criminal penalties for appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief.
   (D)   Discharger's right of appeal. Any discharger or any interested party
has the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the
authority on any matter covered by a municipal ordinance and is entitled to a
prompt, written reply. In the event that such an inquiry is made by the
affected discharger and deals with matters of compliance with the ordinance or
deals with a wastewater discharge permit, receipt of the discharger's request
will delay all enforcement until he receives a written reply.
   (E)   Annual publication of violators. A list of all dischargers in
significant noncompliance pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or state
or federal regulations during the previous calendar year shall be published
annually by the control authority in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW.
The list shall summarize the enforcement actions taken against the dischargers
during the calendar year in which violations were in significant noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment requirements as defined in §
51.002.
   (F)   Suspension of service. The city utilities may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger if it
appears to the city utilities that an actual or threatened discharge presents
an imminent danger to the welfare of the persons, to the environment, to the
operation of the wastewater treatment plant, or violates any pretreatment
limits or wastewater permit. Any discharger notified of the suspension of
wastewater service and/or the discharger's wastewater permit must, within a
reasonable period of time as determined by the city utilities, cease all
discharges. If the discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order wiinin the specified time, the city utilities must immediately commence
judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with the order. The
city utilities can reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or wastewater
treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings provided the discharger
can provide the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions.
   (G)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
nonexclusive. The control authority may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the POTW's Enforcement Response
Plan. However, the control authority may take other action against any User
when the circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
   (H)   Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
      (1)   Upset.
         (a)   An upset, as defined in §
51.002, shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of
division (b) below, are met.
         (b)   An industrial user who wishes to establish affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
            1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
            2.   The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
            3.   The user submitted a description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance; the period of noncompliance, including exact times and
dates or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue; and the steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance to the control authority within 24
hours of becoming aware of the upset (if the information is provided orally, a
written report must be provided within five days):
         (c)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         (d)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
         (e)   The user shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
upon the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
      (2)   Bypass.
         (a)   An industrial user may allow any bypass, as defined in §
51.002, to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to
be violated, but only if it is also essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of divisions (b)
and (c) below.
         (b)   Notice. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible at
least ten days before the date of the bypass. In the case of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards, the industrial user
shall submit oral notice to the control authority within 24 hours from the time
the user became aware of the bypass and a written submission shall also be
submitted within five days of the time the user became aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass.
The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
         (c)   Prohibition of bypass.
            1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless;
               a.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage as defined in §
51.002;
               b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative
maintenance; and
               c.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
division (B) above.
            2.   The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (c) above.

partially used for commercial or industrial purposes. The owner shall have the
privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of
the premises is served through a separate meter and, in such case, the water
usage as registered by the meter serving such portion of the premises used for
residential purposes only shall qualify for the sprinkling rate.

would be that when the following conditions exist, a connection to the sewer
system would not be required:
      (1)   Sewers that were installed prior to 1955 provided that a sewer
connection stub was extended to the property. Should it be necessary for the
city utilities to install a connection stub from the sewer system, then a sewer
connection charge would be required.
      (2)   Sanitary or combined sewer systems installed by a developer,
described as follows: If the developer has the sanitary or combined sewer
installed at no cost to the city utilities, and the sewer system is within the
boundaries of the subdivision or development, there would not be a connection
charge, provided a stub from the sewer system is in place. Should it be
necessary for the city utilities to install a connection stub from the sewer
system, then a connection charge would be required.
      (3)   Any sanitary or combined sewer line, located outside of an approved
development as described in division (2) above that has been dedicated to the
city will require a connection charge and other charges as described in this
chapter.
   (B)   Upon application for connection being made or the liability for
payment arising under ordinances of the city, the amount shall be and become a
lien upon the real estate connected and shall be collected as by this section
and the laws of the state provide.
   (C)   The sewer connection charge shall be immediately due when any
application for connection to the system is made.
   (D)   When due, the sewer connection charge shall may be paid within 15 days
without interest, or at the option of the applicant, and upon the application
filed with the Board, may be paid in five equal annual installments, the first
of which shall be immediately due. The unpaid balance thereafter shall bear
interest at the rate of 8% per annum, payable annually, and shall be due and
payable when each annual installment for the sewer connection charge becomes
due.
   (E)   The owners of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purpose situated within the city,
are hereby required, at their expense, to install suitable sanitary sewer
facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly into the proper
public sewer in accordance with the provisions of §§
51.001 through
51.015 and
51.040 through
51.044, or any other ordinance of the city, hereafter enacted regulating the

§ 51.076 STORM WATER UTILITY FEE.
   (A)   There is hereby established a monthly storm water utility fee for the
use of and services provided by the storm water utility of the city.
   (B)   The monthly fee will be uniform for all residential properties which
will be assigned one equivalent residential unit (ERU). This allocates that all
residents of the city place demands on the storm water utility of the city and
benefit from the storm water management activities of the city.
   (C)   The monthly fee for nonresidential properties will be determined using
an ERU multiplier, which will be calculated by dividing the total impervious
surface area within the property by the base ERU of 2,662 square feet. This
method allows for the nonresidential property user fee to be based upon the
demand the property places on the storm water utility as compared to the
demands of the average residence. The ERU for nonresidential property shall not
be less than one ERU. The ERU multiplier shall then be multiplied by the
current fee for one ERU as established in division (E) below to determine the
actual user fee in dollars.
   (D)   The monthly user fee for combined residential/business properties will
be one ERU for the residential portion and the ERU multiplier will be
calculated for the business portion.
   (E)   The monthly user fee per ERU will be $7.15.
   (F)   If the monthly storm water utility fee is not paid by the due date
stated on the bill, a late charge of 10% will be assessed, together with costs
of collection, if any, including reasonable attorney's fees.
   (G)   The policies and procedures for determining impervious surface area,
establishing the ERU and its multiplier, billing and collection procedures and
the credit process are describe in the Policy Manual, which Policy Manual is
attached hereto as Exhibit A, incorporated herein by reference and is hereby
approved.
   (H)   The Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a reduction in storm
water rates to non-residential users in order to attract new development to the
city, to prevent the loss of existing development within the city, and for new
and existing businesses which add new jobs as follows: If an employer commits
to creating a minimum of 300 new full time 40 hour per week jobs in a five-year
period, the storm water rate will be reduced by 50% per year for five years. If
an employer commits to creating a minimum of 150 new full time 40 hour per week
jobs in a five-year period, the storm water rate will be reduced by 25% per
year for five years. If an employer commits to creating a minimum of 75 new
full time 40 hour per week jobs in a five-year period the storm water rate will
be reduced by 12.5% per year for five years. If within five years the total
number of jobs promised are not provided and maintained the business shall pay
to the city utilities a portion of the storm water reduction calculated as
follows: the business shall pay to the city utilities an amount equal to the
percentage difference between the actual new full times jobs created within
five years and the committed number of new full time jobs multiplied by the
total amount of the storm water rate reduction over the five-year period which
payment shall be paid not later than 90 calendar days after the city utilities
request such payment. A business wanting the storm water rate reduction shall
see the city utilities for the application process and monitoring. Final
approval for the reduction shall come from the Board of Public Works and
Safety.
   (I)   An economic development project properties classification is added as
an additional classification of properties for the purposes of storm water user
fee assessment and collection of a penalty in a case by case basis. The storm
water user fee for economic development project properties shall be an equal
amount to 5% of the amount provided in Ordinance 4306 and the City of
Connersville Policies and Procedures and Drainage Standards Manual.

RUNOFF FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES
§ 54.01 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the City of
Connersville. This subchapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of
any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
results in the movement of earth on land in the City of Connersville.

(Ord. 4533, passed 10-18-04)
§ 54.10 REQUIREMENTS FOR POST- CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER RUNOFF CONTROLS.
   (A)   Introduction/ purpose.
      (1)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm
water runoff rates, runoff volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and
sediment transport and deposition. This storm water runoff contributes to
increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. Storm water runoff, soil
erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through
the regulation of storm water runoff from development sites.
      (2)   The purpose of this section is to establish minimum storm water
management requirements and controls to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of storm water runoff for
the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation and to protect
and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in
watersheds within the City of Connersville. This section seeks to meet that
purpose through minimizing increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes,
erosion and nonpoint source pollution caused by storm water runoff, wherever
possible, through storm water management controls and to ensure that these
management controls are properly maintained.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The provisions of this section are in compliance with 327 IAC 15-13
(Rule 13) and apply to all persons meeting the requirements of 327 IAC 15-13-
16. In general, this section requires the post- construction control of storm
water discharges for both new development and re-development, with a land
disturbance greater than or equal to one acre, or disturbances of less than one
acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if
the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land.
      (2)   The requirements of this section do not apply to the following:
         (a)   Construction of, or modifications to, single-family structures
that are not a part of a larger common plan of development;
         (b)   Single-family residential development consisting of four or
fewer lots;
         (c)   Individual lots within a larger common development plan that has
been previously permitted for storm water management; and
         (d)   Any logging, agricultural, or other activity which is consistent
with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by county, state, or federal regulating agencies.
      (3)   This section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul
any other ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of law.
The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
      (4)   If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph,
subdivision or clause of this section shall be judged invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate
the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of
this section.
   (C)   Submittals, review and approval.
      (1)   The city has developed the Department of Storm Water Management
Drainage Standards Manual (“Drainage Standards Manual”) that provides
additional policy, criteria and information, including specifications and
standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this section.
Revisions to the Drainage Standards Manual may be updated and expanded at the
discretion of the Department of Storm Water Management. Post- construction
runoff control measures shall be designed and installed in accordance with Rule
13 and the Drainage Standards Manual. Storm water treatment practices that are
designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria
will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards. The
Drainage Standards Manual includes acceptable storm water treatment practices,
including specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements
for each storm water practice. The Indiana Storm water Quality Manual produced
by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) may be used as a guidance
document for storm water quality treatment measures.
      (2)   A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) shall be required
that details how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the
development will be controlled or managed. Submittal requirements for the SWPPP
shall be as referenced in 327 IAC 15-5-6.5(a)(8) and the Drainage Standards
Manual.
      (3)   Where appropriate, storage, infiltration, filtering, or vegetative
practices shall be used to reduce the impact of pollutants in storm water
runoff
on receiving waters. In addition to the practices, the following requirements
shall be utilized:
         (a)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead
protection areas.
         (b)   Discharges will not be allowed directly into sinkholes or
fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge meeting
Indiana ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
         (c)   Any storm water practice that is a Class V injection well must
ensure that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground water
quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
         (d)   As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through
conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream bank
erosion.
         (e)   As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of
appropriate width shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches.
         (f)   New gasoline outlets and refueling areas, or outlets and
refueling areas that replace their existing tank systems shall be designed and
installed using appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons in storm water runoff.
      (4)   The Drainage Standards Manual contains requirements for the
drainage application and approval process. An application for drainage approval
shall be submitted to the Department of Storm Water Management on the form
provided for that purpose. A technical review shall be conducted by the
Department of Storm Water Management or its designated representative.
      (5)   Approval of the project from the Department of Storm Water
Management must be obtained prior to the initiation of any land disturbing
activities. Technical review fees shall be the responsibility of the developer
and/or owner and shall be paid in full before final approval is issued.
      (6)   All storm water treatment practices shall be maintained in good
condition in accordance with operation and maintenance requirements for each
storm water practice per the Drainage Standards Manual and the terms and
conditions of the storm water management approval. The owner of the site must
execute a grant of perpetual drainage easement that shall be binding on all
subsequent owners of land served by the storm water management facility. The
easement shall be granted to the Department of Storm Water Management in
accordance with the terms in the Drainage Standards Manual.
      (7)   The city requires the submittal of a performance bond prior to
project construction and a maintenance bond after completion of the project
construction in accordance with the terms in the Drainage Standards Manual.
   (D)   Inspection.
      (1)   The city shall conduct inspections of the installation of the storm
water management system to ensure compliance with the terms of the Drainage
Standards Manual and the storm water management approval.
      (2)   The applicant must notify the city 48 hours in advance of
construction of the storm water management system. Inspections of the system
construction may be conducted by the staff of the city or their designated
representative. If required, the applicant shall execute an inspection services
agreement with the city and pay all applicable inspection fees per the terms
stated in the agreement.
      (3)   The city has the authority to conduct post-construction inspections
to ensure the storm water management facility is maintained in good condition.
Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water
management facility shall make and keep records of the installation and of all
maintenance and repairs. These records shall be made available to the
Department of Storm Water Management upon request and shall be retained for a
period of five years.
      (4)   If the responsible party fails to meet the requirements of the
installation and maintenance conditions per the Drainage Standards Manual and
the terms and conditions of the storm water management approval, the city shall
pursue enforcement action according to division (E) of this section.
   (E)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Written notification. In the event the city or a regulatory agency
determines the installation or maintenance or the storm water management
facility violates the provisions of this section, Rule 13, the Drainage
Standards Manual or the terms of the storm water management approval, the
property owner will be issued a written notification from the Department of
Storm Water Management. The written notification shall be in the form of a
warning letter of noncompliance or violation notice.
      (2)   Noncompliance during construction.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a written notice of violation during
construction, persons receiving a notice of violation will be required to halt
all construction activities. This “stop work order” will be in effect until the
Department of Storm Water Management confirms that the development activity is
in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to
address a notice of violation in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal,
or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in
this section.
         (b)   Following a written notice of violation during construction, the
property owner has five business days to correct the deficiency. In the event
the deficiency is not corrected within this period, a fine of not less than $25
and not more than $500 per deficiency shall be assessed to the property owner,
and each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate violation. The
city may also suspend or revoke a building permit for noncompliance with this
section.
      (3)   Maintenance noncompliance after construction. Upon receipt of
written notice of a maintenance violation, the party responsible for
maintenance shall have 30 calendar days to correct the deficiency. In the event
the deficiency is not corrected within this period, a fine of not less than $25
and not more than $500 per deficiency shall be assessed to the property owner,
and each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate violation. In
the event the deficiency is not correct after 60 calendar days from the notice
of maintenance violation, the city may correct a violation by performing all
necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The city may
assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any
penalties and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated
against the beneficial users of the property, and may be place on the tax bill
and collected as ordinary taxes by the county.

   The provisions of IC 36-7-10.1-1 through 36-7-10.1-5 give cities the
authority to regulate weeds. The legislative body of a municipality may by
ordinance require the owners of real property located within a municipality to
cut and/or remove weeds and other rank vegetation growing on the property. As
used in this chapter, “weeds and other rank vegetation” does not include
agricultural crops, such as hay and pasture.
(Ord. 3236, passed 5-2-94; Am. Ord. 4344, passed 3-3-03)
§ 98.36 REMOVAL OF WEEDS, DEBRIS, AND OTHER SUCH RANK VEGETATION.
   (A)   Definitions.
      DEBRIS. Shall include the remains of something broken-down or destroyed.
      RANK VEGETATION.  Shall include those weeds and growing vegetation which
is excessive in growth, shockingly conspicuous, malodorous and/or flagrant.
      WEEDS.  Shall include any plant that is not valued where it is growing
and is of rank growth, tends to overgrow or choke out more desirable plants,
and/or is listed as a weed in the U.S. Department of Agriculture publication
entitled Common Weeds of the United States or in any similar government
publication.
   (B)   Violation. It is a violation of this section to have weeds, rank
vegetation and/or debris on any real property ("property") located within the
city’s corporate limits.
   (C)   Requirement to cut. All owners of property located within the city
shall cut and remove grass, weeds and other rank vegetation growing thereon
that exceeds an average height of six inches and shall keep their property
clear of debris.
   (D)   Violation notice. The department of the municipality responsible for
the administration of this ordinance will be the City Street Department. In the
event of a violation of this section, the Street Superintendent and/or his or
her designee, the Ordinance Enforcer, or the Police or Fire Department shall
issue a written notice (“violation notice”) to the violating landowner. The
violation notice shall identify the violation and order the landowner to
correct the same within seven calendar days from the date on which the notice
is served on the landowner (“abatement period”). Personal service, service by
U.S. certified mail or any other manner of service recognized in the Indiana
Rules of Trial Procedure shall constitute proper service upon the landowner for
the purposes of this section. The landowner will be determined by records kept
in the office of the Fayette County Auditor.
   (E)   Appeal. Any violation notice issued pursuant to this section may be
appealed to the Board of Public Works and Safety if written notice of appeal is
served on the landowner. The timely appeal of a violation notice shall toll the
abatement period pending the issuance of a decision thereon by the Board of
Public Works and Safety. The landowner must file a written notice of appeal
with the Clerk-Treasurer and the Ordinance Enforcer within two business days of
being served with a violation notice or the request for appeal is deemed
untimely.
   (F)   City to abate. If the landowner fails to timely abate each violation
set forth in a violation notice, the landowner shall be deemed to have granted
permission to the city to enter the landowner’s property for the limited
purpose of cutting and/or removing such debris, weeds or rank vegetation
located thereon and identified in a violation notice. In such case the Street
Superintendent, or his or her designee, shall prepare a certified statement as
to the actual administrative and other costs incurred by the city in taking
such action, and serve a copy of the invoice on the landowner. The landowner
shall, within seven calendar days from the date on which the landowner was
served with such invoice ("payment period"), pay in full the amount stated
thereon to the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (G)   Appeal of costs. Any invoice issued pursuant to this section may be
appealed to the Board of Public Works and Safety if written notice of appeal is
served on the Clerk-Treasurer and the Ordinance Enforcer within seven calendar
days from the date on which the invoice is served upon the landowner. The
timely appeal of an invoice shall toll the payment period pending the issuance
of a decision thereon by the Board of Public Works and Safety. If the landowner
does not file a written notice of appeal within seven days after receiving
service of the invoice, the invoice is deemed to be valid and any written
notice of appeal will thereafter deemed untimely.
   (H)   Failure to pay. If a landowner fails to timely pay an invoice issued
pursuant to this section, the
Clerk-Treasurer, or his or her designee, shall certify to the County Auditor
the amount of the invoice plus any additional administrative costs incurred and
certification of the same. The Auditor shall place the total amount so
certified on the tax duplicate for the property at issue, and the total amount,
including any accrued interest, shall be collected as delinquent taxes are
collected and shall be disbursed to the general fund of the city.
   (I)   Time of appeals. The Board of Public Works and Safety shall hear any
timely requested appeal of a notice of violation or invoice within 30 calendar
days following receipt of the same, and shall promptly thereafter issue a
written decision granting or denying, in all or in part, the appeal. The date
on which the Board’s decision is served on the landowner shall thereafter
become the first calendar day of the abatement period or payment period, as
applicable.
   (J)   This section supplements and does not limit any other remedy or action
available in law or in equity regarding the subject matter hereof.
(Ord. 4344, passed 3-3-03)
§ 98.37 ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO ABATE DANGEROUS WEEDS.
   (A)   The city may abate, without notice, weeds that have grown higher than
12 inches and are an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of any
person.
      (1)   If the property is abandoned and/or not occupied the city may
abate, without notice, weeds that have grown higher than eight inches and are
an immediate danger to the health, safety, or welfare of any person.

mowed immediately then the city will proceed to abate the nuisance by mowing
and that the charge of abatement of the nuisance shall be sent to the owner of
record for payment and if not paid place on the tax rolls through the Auditor’s
Office of Fayette County as provided by law.
         (b)   Once the initial notice set out above is provided by certified
mail, a continuous abatement notice may be posted at the property at the time
of mowing and this continuous abatement notice serves as notice to the property
owner that each subsequent violation during the same year for which the initial
notice for violation was provided may be abated by the city.
   (B)   No later than the tenth day after the date the city abates weeds under
this section, the city shall give notice as described in §
98.36. The notice shall contain:

for placement on the tax duplicate as outlined in §
98.36.

Fine aggregate    2,010 to 3,150 pounds per cubic yard
Water as required approximately 500 pounds per cubic yard
 
         (g)   The producer may use water as reducing admixtures and air
entraining admixtures when used in accordance with the admixtures
manufacturer’s recommendations. The flowable fill may have air content from 0
to 25% by volume.
         (h)   Before any flowable fill is placed, any pipes, any structure, or
other objects that might be displaced by the placement of the flowable fill
shall be adequately anchored, braced or secured.
         (i)   The mixture shall be delivered and discharged from ready mix
trucks approved for use by INDOT and a copy of the batch ticket furnished to

designee. The final approval for cuts of allowed deviation shall be conditional
for a period of three years. Any failure to remain level even with adjacent
pavement and in good repair prior to three years from the date of final
conditional approval shall be repaired in accordance with the above
requirements.
      (2)   The applicant further agrees that in the event the excavation is
not properly filled, closed, and sealed or resurfaced pursuant to the
established standards and regulations of the City Engineer and after due notice
from the City Engineer of the defects or omissions, the applicant shall
immediately proceed to correct the defects or omissions in the closing of the
excavation.

agents, employees, or subcontractors engaged in the performance of the work or
the joint negligence of any of them. The applicant also agrees to pay all
reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred by or imposed on the city
arising out of a lawsuit filed against the city for damages, provided a court
of competent jurisdiction makes a determination that the applicant, its agents,
employees or subcontractors has been guilty of negligence in pursuance of the
work resulting from the issuance of a permit for a street cut or excavation,
which negligence caused damage to the prevailing aggrieved party, provided the
city was not guilty of independent or concurring negligence.
      (6)   The applicant agrees to remove all unused materials of construction
immediately upon completion and removal of all traffic control materials with
opening for public use. This shall not exceed 30 days from date of application

other arrangement for the turning of all vehicles conveniently within the
right-of- way.
      (7)   Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas but shall be
included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and
unloading or access purposes, and, where platted, shall be at least 20 feet in
width.
      (8)   The center lines of streets should intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible.
      (9)   At intersections of streets and alleys, property line corners shall
be rounded by arcs of at least 20 feet radii or by chords of such arcs.
      (10)   At intersections of streets, the property line corners shall be
rounded by arcs with radii of not less than 15 feet or by chords of such arcs.
      (11)   If the smaller angle of intersection of two streets is less than
60 degrees, the radius of the arc at the intersection of property lines shall
be increased as deemed advisable by the Commission.
      (12)   Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided.
      (13)   Where parkways or special types of streets are involved, the
Commission may apply special standards to be followed in the design of such
parkways or streets.
      (14)   Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a
railroad right-of-way or a highway designated as a “Limited Access Highway” by
the appropriate highway authorities, provision shall be made for a marginal
access street or a parallel street at a distance acceptable for the appropriate
use of the land between the highway or railroad and such streets.
      (15)   Horizontal visibility on curved streets and vertical visibility on
all streets must be maintained along the center lines as follows:
         (a)   Arterial streets: 500 feet;
         (b)   Feeder streets and parkways: 300 feet; and
         (c)   Residential streets: 150 feet.

tangent of not less than 100 feet, and on feeder and residential streets such
tangent shall not be less than 40 feet.
      (18)   Maximum grades for streets shall be as follows:
         (a)   Arterial streets: Not greater than 6%; and
         (b)   Feeder and residential streets and alleys: Not greater than 10%.
      (19)   The minimum grade of any street gutter shall not be less than
0.5%.
      (20)   Proposed streets that are extensions of or in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the same name as that borne by the existing street.
      (21)   Normally, only one street, driveway or point of vehicle access
shall be permitted from a subdivision onto an arterial or feeder street;
provided, however, that any such street, driveway or point of vehicle access
shall not be allowed if unreasonably harmful to the health, safety, and general
welfare of the public. Two or more streets, driveways or points of vehicle
access may be permitted by the Commission, if they do not impair the public
health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks should not normally exceed 1600 feet in length, unless
unusual circumstances justify greater length.
      (2)   Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited access
highway or an arterial street or a railroad right-of- way.
      (3)   In blocks of over 1000 feet in length, the Commission may require
at or near the middle of the block a public walk connecting adjacent streets or
other public areas. Such walks shall be at least ten feet in width of right-of-
way and shall be intended for the use of pedestrians only.
   (D)   Lots.
      (1)   All lots shall abut on a street or place. Generally, the depth of a
lot (see §
153.43 for definition of depth of lot in the Zoning Code) shall not exceed
three times the lot frontage, (see §
153.43 for definition of frontage of lot in the Zoning Code), except as
provided in §
152.04, subdivision (e) of the definition of subdivision herein. Some deviation
from this provision may be permissible for topographical and drainage purposes,
but not for the purpose of splitting a large tract into deeper than normal lots
so that the provision of streets for proper access to lots can be avoided.
Unusually deep lots or numerous “pipe stem” lots (lots with minimal lot
frontage adjacent to one another) shall be discouraged in subdivisions.
      (2)   Side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to
straight streets and approximately on radial lines on curved streets. Some
variation from this rule is permissible, but pointed or very irregular lots
should be avoided.
      (3)   Double frontage lots should not be platted, except that where
desired along arterial streets, lots may face on an interior street and back on
such thoroughfares. In that event a planting strip, or a planting screen, at
least ten feet in width, shall be provided along the back of the lot.
      (4)   Widths and areas of lots shall not be less than that provided in
the Zoning Code for single- family dwellings for the district in which the
subdivision is located (except for a subdivision defined in §
152.04), except that when a water main supply system or a sanitary sewer system
is not available, the larger lot area necessary to install a private water
supply or private sewage disposal on the lot in accordance with the regulations
of the Department of Environmental Management of Indiana regulations shall
become the required minimum lot area.
      (5)   Wherever possible, unit shopping centers, based upon sound
development standards, should be designed in contrast to the platting of lots
for individual commercial use.
      (6)   Corner residential lots shall be wider than normal in order to
permit appropriate setbacks from both streets. Interior residential lots
abutting a corner lot shall be wider than the average interior lot in order to
permit a wider side yard adjacent to the corner lot.
   (E)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements shall be provided for all utility lines, including but
not limited to electric power, telephone and CATV.
      (2)   Easements centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for
utilities where necessary and shall be at least ten feet wide on both sides of
the property lines. Easements shall be contiguous to the street at the end of
the block to connect with adjoining blocks in the shortest direct line.
      (3)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
ditch, channel, or stream, there shall be provided an adequate storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of
such water course.
      (4)   Before determining the location of easements, the plan shall be
discussed with the Utility Service Board and the local public utility companies
to assure their proper placing for the installation of services.
      (5)   Where alleys are not provided, easements for utilities shall be
provided. Such easements shall have minimum widths of 12 feet, and where
located along lot lines, one-half the width shall be taken from each lot.
Before determining the location of easements, the plan shall be discussed with
the local public utility companies to assure their proper placing for the
installation of services.
   (F)   Building setback lines shall be as provided in the Zoning Code.

to the Board of County Commissioners, stating they find the improvements to
have been constructed, installed, and completed in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, if such is the case.
   (C)   Drainage facilities.
      (1)   Prior to the construction of street or alley surfaces and
pavements, adequate drainage facilities shall be installed by the subdivider,
according to plans furnished by the subdivider prepared by a registered
professional engineer or a registered land surveyor and approved by the
Commission. A storm drainage analysis based upon a ten-year, one-hour rainfall
shall be used as the basis for the drainage system. A copy of the analysis is
to be submitted to the Commission with the drainage facility plans.
      (2)   Grading. Lots and blocks shall be so graded as to eliminate
depressions that would accumulate storm water. Grades at building sites shall
bear such relationships to roadway and curb grades as to prevent flooding
during heavy storms of basement windows or of entryways either to basement or
to first floor levels in the absence of basements. Where deemed necessary, the
Plan Commission may require the subdivider to submit working drawings showing
contours to which the property is to be graded to provide for the requirements
of this division (2). The Plan Commission shall transmit a copy of the approved
drainage plan to the City Engineer or Fayette County Surveyor.
      (3)   Pipe used for drainage shall be of coated corrugated metal,
concrete or vitrified clay of an approved design, size and strength to meet the
requirements of the specific conditions which may be encountered. Culverts on
existing streets shall be enlarged wherever necessary by reason of diverted or
increased concentrations of drainage. Minimum diameters of pipe to be used
shall be as follows:
      Roadway cross-drains      12"
      Entrance culverts      10"
      Perforated under-drains    8"
      (4)   Where curbs and gutters are not provided in the street, shallow
swales with low points at least 12 inches below the subgrade of the pavement
may be required by the Commission.
      (5)   Upon completion of the street improvements, a minimum of two sets
of as-built plan and profiles shall be filed with the Commission.
   (D)   Sewers.
      (1)   The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with sanitary sewage
facilities in accordance with one of the three following procedures:
         (a)   Public collection system. In all cases where such is possible
the developer shall construct a sanitary sewer system connected to a city
sewer.
            1.   The plans for the system shall be approved by the City Utility
Service Board if the plat of the subdivision is proposed to be located in the
service area of the city utilities or the Fayette County Health Officer if the
plat is proposed to be located in the unincorporated territory or serviced by a
sewer district, and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
“Fayette County Area Sanitary Sewer Design and Construction Specifications.”
            2.   Service laterals shall be installed between the street main
and the property line before the street is paved.
         (b)   Local treatment system. Where it is not possible to connect the
subdivision sanitary sewer system to a city sewer, as determined by the
Commission, the subdivider shall construct a local treatment system consisting
of the necessary house laterals, service mains, and interceptors required to
conduct the subdivision's sanitary sewage to a single treatment facility. All
aspects of such system, including the treatment facility, shall be designed
with the requirements of the “Fayette County Area Sanitary Sewer Design and
Construction Specifications,” and the “Fayette County Area Recommended
Standards for Sewage Works,” and the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management, and constructed by the subdivider in accordance with the
requirements of the respective City Utility Service Board or the Fayette County
Health Officer, as the case may be.
         (c)   Private disposal system. Where alternatives listed in divisions
(a) and (b) above are not practical, the Commission may permit the subdivider
to install on each lot an individual sewage disposal system consisting of a
septic tank and tile absorption field or other approved disposal system. Such
systems shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider in accordance with
the “Recommended Standards for Individual Sewage Systems” and the requirements
of the Fayette County Sanitarian and the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management. In no case, however, shall private disposal systems be permitted
where soil conditions exist which would prevent percolation of effluent.
      (2)   The plans for the installation of the sanitary sewage facilities
shall be provided by the subdivider, prepared by a registered professional
engineer, or a registered professional land surveyor, and approved by the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the Fayette County Health
Officer. Upon the completion of sanitary sewer installations, two sets of the
as-built plans for such system shall be filed with the Commission.
      (3)   In this division and division (E) below, the phrase “the subdivider
shall provide” shall be interpreted to mean that the subdivider shall install
the facility referred to, or whenever a private sewage disposal system or an
individual water supply is to be provided, that the subdivider shall require,
as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel in the subdivision, that the
facilities referred to in these sections shall be installed by the developer of
the lots in accordance with these regulations.
      (4)   In all cases the Plan Commission shall determine the feasibility of
any appropriate sewage disposal alternative.
   (E)   Water.
      (1)   The subdivider shall provide the main subdivision with a complete
water supply system, which shall be connected to a municipal water utility
system; except, that when such water supply is not available as determined by
the Commission, the subdivider shall provide an individual water supply on each
lot in the subdivision in accordance with requirements of the Fayette County
Health Officer. The water supply system shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the requirements of the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management.
      (2)   The plans for the installation of a water main supply system shall
be provided by the subdivider and approved by the City Utilities Service Board
or the Fayette County Health Officer or applicable authority. Construction of
water mains and house services to be placed within the improved portion of the
street right-of-way shall be completed prior to the placement of the surface
improvements. Upon the completion of the water supply installation, two sets of
the plans for such system as built shall be filed with the Commission.
   (F)   Improvement credit procedure.
      (1)   Improvements required in this section to be installed by the

the Statement of Compliance. When the parcel so exempted by this statement is
conveyed to another party the copy of the instrument of such conveyance shall

for this purpose.
   (B)   Specifications and documentation to be submitted. The information that
must be provided in order for the decision to be made that a division is an
exempted division varies as follows according to the definition of subdivision
in §

of the private drives, parking areas, and size of burial lots must be provided.
   (C)   Exempted division review process. Within three working days of the
land divider's complete submission of the required information in the case of
exempted divisions, above, the Plan Commission Staff shall review the
submission and notify the land subdivider that his proposed land division
either qualifies as an exempted division and is thus exempt from all other
provisions of this chapter, or does not qualify as an exempted division and is
thus subject to the relevant subdivision processes in this chapter.

date of the decision of the Commission under Step 2, of Appendix B.
   (B)   Bond. Secondary approval may be granted to a plat of a subdivision in
which the improvements and installations have not been completed as required by
this chapter, if the applicant provides a bond, or other proof of financial
responsibility as prescribed herein, that:
      (1)   Is an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to
complete the improvements and installations in compliance with this chapter;
      (2)   Provides surety satisfactory to the Commission;

or extended in compliance with this chapter.
      (4)   Other proof of financial responsibility may take the following
forms:
         (a)   An arrangement whereby cash would be advanced to the city, or
the county (depending upon whether the plat of the subdivision is located in
the city or beyond the city) by the subdivider, and subsequently the Clerk-
Treasurer of the city or the Auditor of the county (as the case may be) would
release to the subdivider amounts of this money in percentages of the total
cost of improvements and installations in the plat of a subdivision, when such
completed portions of the plat have been attested to by a registered
professional civil engineer or registered land surveyor, provided by and at the
expense of the subdivider, and approved by the Commission; and upon a
certificate by the City Engineer of the city, or the County Surveyor of the
county (as the case may be). Upon completion of all of the improvements and
installations in the plat, the city, or county (as the case may be) would
reimburse the subdivider the total balance of the money originally deposited
with the city, or county; or
         (b)   An arrangement, including a letter of credit, whereby the city,
or the county (depending upon whether the plat of the subdivision is located in

institution, until all of the improvements and installations in the plat of a
subdivision have been completed.
         (c)   Maintenance bond. The applicant shall provide a three-year
maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the Commission based upon the
assurance that all improvements provided and installed by the subdivider will
be properly maintained to the satisfaction of the Board of Works or Board of
County Commissioners (as the case may be), but not less in amount than $10,000,
before secondary approval may be granted, except in cases when there are not
any improvements requiring maintenance. The applicant shall provide a three
year maintenance bond before secondary approval may be granted. (See Appendix
A, Form 4.)
         (d)   Hearing not required. No notice or hearing is required for
secondary approvals.
         (e)   Recording provided. A plat of a subdivision may not be filed
with the Auditor of the county, and the Recorder of the county may not record
it, unless it has been granted secondary approval and signed and certified by
the President and Secretary of the Commission; provided, that if the plat has
not been properly recorded within six months after the date of such
certification, the certification shall then become null and void and the plat
may not then be recorded; and provided further, that a subdivider or applicant
whose plat has not been recorded within six months from the date of
certification, and who elects to make revisions to the plat, must first vacate
the plat in accordance with IC 36-7-3 and then proceed to reapply for primary
and secondary approval of the plat of a subdivision.
         (f)   Bond release. The bond referred to in division (A), above, will
be released only upon receipt of a certificate provided by and at the expense
of the subdivider, and approved by the Commission, and upon a certificate by
the City Engineer or the County Surveyor of Fayette County (as the case may
be), that all improvements and installations for the plat of the subdivision
required for its approval have been made or installed in accordance with
specifications.
         (g)   Funds from bonds. Any funds received from bonds shall be used by
the Board of Works or Board of Commissioners (as the case may be), only for the
completion of the improvements and installations for which they were provided;
and said Board of Works or Board of Commissioners (as the case may be), is
authorized to complete such improvements and installations on the failure of
the applicant to do so.

   (B)   Zone map. The zone map, which is hereby declared to be a part of this
chapter, shows the boundaries of the area covered by the districts. Notations,
references, indications and other matters shown on the zone map are as much a
part of this chapter as if they were fully described herein.
   (C)   Flood Plain District. The Flood Plain Districts (areas subject to
inundation by the regulatory flood) as identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration on the Fayette County Flood Insurance Rate Map dated June 22,
1979, and on the city Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 23, 1973, revised
June 11, 1976, along with any subsequent revisions to the text of the federal
criteria or maps and adopted by reference and made a part of this chapter as
fully described herein, is established, and the boundaries thereof shall
supersede the boundaries of any other district shown on the zone map. (See §§
153.20 and
153.45.)
(Ord. 3095, passed 2-15-93)
§ 153.03 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
zone map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Centerlines of streets and boundaries. Unless otherwise indicated, the
district boundary lines are the center lines of streets, parkways, alleys or
railroad rights-of-way, or such lines extended.
   (B)   Existing lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following
section lines, half-section and quarter-section lines, city or town corporate
limit lines, or platted lot lines shall be construed as follow such lines.
   (C)   Railroad lines. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall
be construed to be midway between the main tracks.
   (D)   Shore lines and waterways. Boundaries indicated as following shore
lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines, and in the event of change
in the shore lines shall be construed as moving with the actual shore lines.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams,
creeks, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center
lines.
   (E)   Use of scale on zone map. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or
extensions of features indicated in divisions (A) through (D) above shall be so
construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the zone map shall be
determined by the scale of the map.
   (F)   Board may determine. Where physical or cultural features existing on
the ground are at variance with those shown on the zone map, or in other
circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (E) herein, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall interpret the district boundaries.
   (G)   Vacations and relocations. The vacation or relocation of rights-of-way
and lot lines shall not affect the location of district boundaries; provided,
however, whenever any right-of-way is vacated by proper authority, the
districts adjoining each side of such vacation shall be extended automatically
to the center of such vacation.
   (H)   Line splitting lots. Where a district boundary line divides a lot
which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this chapter, the Board

nonconforming use of the same or greater restrictions, provided the size of the
structure is not increased.

provisions of the district in which it is located. In the event the damage or
destruction is less than 50% of its replacement value, based upon prevailing

structure must be started within a period of six months from the date of damage
or destruction, and diligently pursued to completion.

(Ord. 3095, passed 2-15-93)
§ 153.21.1 FP FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives.
      (1)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-
4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Fayette County and the
Common Council of the City of Connersville do hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
      (2)   Findings of fact.
         (a)   The flood hazard areas of Fayette County and the City of
Connersville are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
         (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
      (3)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
         (a)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
         (b)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
         (c)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters.
         (d)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage.
         (e)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.
         (f)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in Fayette County and the city by fulfilling the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
      (4)   Objectives. The objectives of this section are:
         (a)   To protect human life and health.
         (b)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
         (c)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
         (d)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
         (e)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
         (f)   To help maintain a stable tax base, by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas.
   (B)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have
in common usage and to give this section its most reasonable application.
      (1)   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A
ZONES, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions
are presented below:
         (a)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no
base flood elevation or depths are shown.
         (b)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
         (c)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
         (d)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
         (e)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
         (f)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special
flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base
flood elevations or depths are shown.
      (2)   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a
floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the
use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
      (3)   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed
expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by
a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
ADDITION, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
      (4)   APPEAL. A request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this section.
      (5)   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
      (6)   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
      (7)   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance
flood.
      (8)   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (9)   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary
between Kentucky and Indiana.
      (10)   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
      (11)   BUILDING. See “Structure.”

enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
      (13)   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
      (14)   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
      (15)   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but
flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities
but is not required by regulation in this zone.
      (16)   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate including but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of

roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
      (17)   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the
lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),

before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
      (20)   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
      (21)   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.
The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final

      (22)   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (23)   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
      (24)   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory
floodway.
      (25)   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community,
on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the
risk premium zones applicable to the community.
      (26)   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
      (27)   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as
being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “Flood.”)
      (28)   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory
flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See “Freeboard.”)
      (29)   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any
wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by
the regulatory flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe
districts.
      (30)   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
      (31)   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This section and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS are also referred to as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN
ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REQUIREMENTS.
      (32)   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a
structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities
and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.
      (33)   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer
or architect.
      (34)   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of
the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to
efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of
any river or stream.
      (35)   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the
BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
      (36)   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.
      (37)   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this section). The
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
      (38)   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls
of a structure.

National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic
Sites and Structures.
      (40)   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a
substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that
is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the
local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and
new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
      (41)   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA
during the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and
provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates
the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
      (42)   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the
several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished
by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
         (a)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
         (b)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
         (c)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official
revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on
fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
      (43)   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
      (44)   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
         (a)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
         (b)   The top of the basement floor.
         (c)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level
of the structure.
         (d)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
         (e)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a
basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide
any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
            1.   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the
hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways
and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than
one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
            2.   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one
square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
            3.   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
      (44)   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
      (45)   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
      (46)   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual
cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
      (47)   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-
term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
MITIGATION is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.
      (48)   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that
makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating
communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal
government and the private insurance industry.

construction” commenced after the effective date of the community’s first
floodplain ordinance.
      (51)   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum,

canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
      (55)   ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1%
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that
begins with the letter A is subject to the 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. See
“Regulatory flood.”
      (56)   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a
community’s FEMA map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood
elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas,
or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
      (57)   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the
safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable
number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or

is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-
YEAR FLOOD.
      (61)   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25%
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
      (62)   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of
1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a
duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public
body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
      (63)   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the
jurisdiction of Fayette County and the City of Connersville subject to
inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the county and the city are
generally identified as such on the Fayette County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated February 18, 2015 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A,
AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
      (64)   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means
the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the
permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (65)   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is
enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
      (66)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
      (67)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have
incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
requirements or any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
      (68)   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
      (69)   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this section,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (70)   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this section. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this section is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that
documentation is provided.
      (71)   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
      (72)   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the
SFHA. Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate
areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
      (73)   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the
severity or type of flooding in the area.
      (74)   ZONE A. (See definition for “A zone.”)
      (75)   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND
C.)
   (C)   General provisions.
      (1)   Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to
all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Fayette County
and the city.
      (2)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This section’s
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
         (a)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Fayette County and the city shall
be as delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study of Fayette County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated February 18, 2015 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date.
         (b)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Fayette County and the city,
delineated as an “A Zone” on the Fayette County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated February 18, 2015 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a
party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
         (c)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
         (d)   Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
section prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (4)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (6)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
         (a)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.
         (b)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
         (c)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site
shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be
applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
      (7)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section all provisions shall be:
         (a)   Considered as minimum requirements.
         (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
         (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (8)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this section does not create any liability on the part of Fayette
County, the city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
      (9)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this section. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code.
All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500.
         (a)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
         (b)   The Fayette County Area Planning Commission shall inform the
owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood
damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy
to be suspended.
         (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city or county from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (D)   Administration.
      (1)   Designation of Administrator. The Executive Director or Zoning
Administrator for the Fayette County Area Planning Commission shall administer
and implement the provisions of this section and is herein referred to as the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Permit procedures. Application for a floodplain development permit
shall be made to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her
prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to,
the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following
information is required:
         (a)   Application stage.
            1.   A description of the proposed development.
            2.   Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure(s) in relation to existing roads and streams.
            3.   A legal description of the property site.
            4.   A site development plan showing existing and proposed
development locations and existing and proposed land grades.
            5.   Elevation of the top of the planned lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD.
            6.   Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be floodproofed.
            7.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. A hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted
to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a letter of map revision. (See division
(D)(3)(f) for additional information.)
         (b)   Construction stage.
            1.   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated
structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD
88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant
shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification
shall be at the applicant’s risk.
            2.   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor elevation is
required to be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project
includes a floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification is required to be
submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator and/or designated staff is hereby authorized and
directed to enforce the provisions of this section. The Administrator is
further authorized to render interpretations of this section, which are

determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, letters of map change (LOMC),
copies of DNR permits, letters of authorization, and floodplain analysis and
regulatory assessments (letters of recommendation), federal permit documents,
and “as-built” elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed
subject to this section.
         (h)   Utilize and enforce all letters of map change (LOMC) or physical
map revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the
community.
         (i)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished.
         (j)   Review certified plans and specifications for compliance.
         (k)   Verify and record the actual elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with division (D)(2).
         (l)   Verify and record the actual elevation to which any new or

of this section shall immediately cease.
            2.   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work,
and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
         (n)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of the section, in cases where there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this section.
   (E)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
      (1)   General standards. In all SFHAs and known flood prone areas the
following provisions are required:
         (a)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
         (b)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,

         (j)   Parking lots, driveways, and sidewalks within the SFHA shall be
constructed with permeable materials.
         (k)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of
excavation taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal
to the volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of 1 to 1) due to the fill or
structure.
            1.   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located.
            2.   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory flood water, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by flood water, and that it shall not be refilled.
            3.   The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater
but shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by flood water.
            4.   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way
leading to the floodplain.
            5.   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory flood water.
            6.   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement.
            7.   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
this division.
      (2)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:
         (a)   in addition to the requirements of division (E)(1), all
structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below
the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
            1.   Construction or placement of any structure having a floor area
greater than 400 square feet.
            2.   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where
the cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of
the existing structure (excluding the value of the land).
            3.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where
the costs of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred.
            4.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days.

            5.   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
            6.   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
            7.   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with
the structure’s deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below
the lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet)
shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have
the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
         (e)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
            1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot
deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
            2.   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
            3.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is

Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if
no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed
within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the
site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
      (5)   Standards for identified floodways.
         (a)   Located within SFHAs, established in division (C)(2), are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has
erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under
the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before
the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude
non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a
non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-
substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river
floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in division (E) of this section have been
met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
         (c)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the
regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
         (d)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the Fayette County Area Planning Commission shall submit the
data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the
regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
      (6)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in division (E)
of this section have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest
floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the
FPG.
      (7)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
         (a)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
            2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
            3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper
permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in division (E) of this section have been met.
         (b)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
            1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
            2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in division
(E) of this section have been met.
         (c)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase
flood damages or potential flood damages.
      (8)   Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood
prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is
available, shall meet applicable standards as required per division (E).
   (F)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
requirements of this section.
      (2)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The board shall hear and
decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this section. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
board may appeal such decision to the Fayette County Circuit Court.
      (3)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this section; and

to the community.
         (d)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development,
         (g)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (h)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (i)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site.
         (j)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Conditions for variances.
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
         (b)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
division (E)(5) or division (E)(7)(a) of this section may be granted.
         (c)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to division (E)(5) or
division (E)(7)(a) of this section will require a permit from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
         (d)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of
division (E)(2), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
         (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (f)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration
of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
         (g)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and
the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the
cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See division (F)(5)).
         (h)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See
division (F)(5)).
      (5)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood
protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
      The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
      (6)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (7)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
division (F), and the purposes of this section, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this section.
   (G)   Severability. If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this
section is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the
remaining portions of this section.
   (H)   Effective date. This section shall be in full force and effect on
February 18, 2015.
(Ord. 6235, passed 1-20-15)
§ 153.21.2 AIRPORT PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT (APO).
   The Airport Protection Overlay District (APO) shall include all zones as
identified on the Imaginary Surfaces and Vicinity Map included as part of the
Connersville Municipal Airport, Airport Layout Plan, Noise Sensitive Area Zone
and Wildlife Attractant Zones.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is hereby found that hazards to airport and
flight operations (airport hazard) as a potential public nuisance have the
potential to endanger the lives and property of users of Connersville Municipal
Airport, the property and the occupants of land in its vicinity. An airport
hazard may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the
Municipal Airport; may reduce the size of areas available for the landing,
takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the
utility of the Municipal Airport and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is declared:
      (1)   That it is necessary to avoid the creation or establishment of an
airport hazard that has the potential of being a public nuisance and may injure
the region served by the Municipal Airport.
      (2)   That it is necessary to protect past, present and future
investments made by the Connersville Airport Board.
      (3)   That it is necessary in the interests of the public health safety
and general welfare that the creation of airport hazards be prevented.
      (4)   That the prevention of the creation of hazards to air navigation,
the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air
navigation, or marking and lighting of obstructions are public purposes for
which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire
land or interests in land.
      (5)   That these purposes may be achieved by:
         (a)   Minimizing land uses located in close proximity to the airport
that may negatively affect airport operations;
         (b)   Discouraging land uses located in close proximity to the airport
that may be negatively affected by airport operations;
         (c)   Minimizing wildlife incursions on airport property or airspace,
particularly migratory birds;
         (d)   Disallowing tall structures that impede aircraft operations;
         (e)   Disallowing lighting and other development that may disrupt
aircraft operations;
         (f)   Encouraging land uses that add value to and complement the
airport;
         (g)   Reduce the risk to life and property;
         (h)   Ensuring that all developments at and around the airport are
compatible with airport operations;
         (i)   Maximizing federal and state funding and Federal Aviation
Administration support for airport expansion, acquisition and improvements; and
         (j)   Minimizing complaints and remonstration against airport
expansion and increases in operation activities.
      All airports that receive federal grants are obligated by contract to
follow FAA advisory circulars. Failure to follow FAA advisory circulars may
result in forfeiture of current funding and the loss of standing to apply for
future funding.

not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of the adoption of the APO district, or otherwise interfere with
the continuance of any nonconforming use.
      (3)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction, or that would result in a
nonconforming use or structure becoming a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of the adoption of the APO district, or any future
to the APO district rules.
      (4)   The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required
to permit the installation of, operation and maintenance thereon of markers and
lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Board to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of airport
hazards. The lights and markers shall be installed, operated and maintained at
the expense of the Airport Board and shall be in accordance with FAA standards.
   (I)   Administration and enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Fayette
County Area Plan Commission office to administer and enforce provisions of the
APO district. No material change shall be made in the use of the land, no
structure shall be erected, altered or otherwise established in any zone hereby
created unless a permit shall have been applied for and granted by the County
Area Plan Commission office. When required under the provisions of this section
prior to the issuance of a permit the applicant shall submit a copy of the site
and construction plans to the Airport Board to ensure the project described
within the plans shall not create a hazard to air traffic and the use of the
Municipal Airport. Upon a finding of “no hazard to airport operations” by the
Airport Board the County Area Plan Commission office shall issue all required
permits as per the procedures and requirements of the Fayette County Area
Zoning.
      (1)   Submission and review process. For any project on a property
entirely or partially located within any zone associated with the Airport
Overlay Protection District the proposed project shall be reviewed to determine
whether or not the project presents a potential hazard to airport or flight
operations. The application package shall include a completed application along
with construction plans, and site development plans which must include the
maximum height of all structures included in the plan. Plans must demonstrate
that the proposed project meets the conditions of division (K), development
standards, of this section and presents no hazard to airport or flight
operations.
      (2)   The applicant for any use that is regulated through this overlay
district shall submit two sets of plans and the application to Area Plan
Commission office. Area Plan Commission staff shall review the plans for
compliance with the following provisions and in accordance with FAA-FAR Part
77.
         (a)   Within the horizontal surface, conical surface, approach
surface, and transitional surface the project proponent shall submit a full set
of site development plans to the Airport Board when required to submit to the
FAA at the time of filing with the FAA.
         (b)   Within the FAA-FAR Part 77 construction projects shall be

§ 153.22 UD UNIT DEVELOPMENT PLAN DISTRICT.
   This District is intended to provide more development flexibility than is
possible through the application of customary zoning regulations. In
recognition of both the rapid changes in design and technology in the building
industry and new demands in the housing market, it is deemed necessary to meet
those changes in a manner that will be consistent with the best interests of
Fayette County and the city.
   (A)   Statement of purpose.
      (1)   To encourage a more creative approach in land and building site
planning.
      (2)   To encourage an efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open
space.
      (3)   To promote variety in the physical development pattern of the
community.
      (4)   To achieve flexibility and incentives for residential development
which will produce a wider range of choice.
      (5)   To encourage renewal of older areas where new development and
restoration are needed to revitalize the areas.
      (6)   To permit special consideration of property with unique features,
such as historical significance, unusual topography, landscape amenities, and
size and shape.
      (7)   To recapture by-passed land so poorly planned and developed as to
be a public liability.
      (8)   To simplify processing of development proposals for developers and
the Commission by providing for concurrent review of land use, subdivision,
public improvements and siting considerations.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The provisions of this section shall apply to a tract of land of at
least five acres in area for undeveloped areas within the jurisdiction of the
Commission; provided that said provisions may apply to a proposed development
in which the primary or entire use is business or enclosed industrial use when
such proposal is deemed to be in the best interests of the county and city.
      (2)   The provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed new
developments and shall not apply to any part of an area contained within a
subdivision previously approved (and recorded) in accordance with the
requirements of Chapter 152, Area Subdivision Code, prior to the time of
passage of this chapter, or any Unit Development Plan which is now fully or
partially developed, nor to any such development for which a final
authorization has been granted pursuant to a previous ordinance; provided,
however, that a petitioner may, upon application and approval of the
Commission, become subject to all the benefits and burdens of this section,
subject to such rights as shall have been vested in the owners of the area
affected by development under such ordinance; provided further that any plat
shall first be vacated.
      (3)   Uses permitted in a residential unit development plan may include
and shall be limited to:
         (a)   Dwelling units in detached, semi- detached, attached or multi-
storied structures or any combination thereof.
         (b)   Non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and
business or enclosed industrial character, which uses are an integral part of a
residential development logically oriented to and coordinated with the total
planned unit. Such uses shall be planned and gauged primarily for the service
and convenience of the anticipated population of the unit development.
         (c)   No business use, nor any building devoted primarily to a
business use or enclosed industrial use, shall be built or established prior to
the residential buildings or uses it is designated or intended to serve.
      (4)   The basic land unit of a unit development is the block, parcel,
tract, combination of lots, or acreage, and not the lot; provided, however,
divisible geographic sections of the entire planned unit development may be
designated.
         (a)   A proposed unit development plan shall be designed to produce an
environment of stable and desirable character in keeping with the principles of
good neighborhood design, and must provide standards of open space, efficiency
in street patterns and areas for parking adequate for the occupancy proposed,
or equal to the requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   Before approval of a preliminary unit development plan, a
determination of land use intensity shall be declared, and the Commission shall
make a finding that said intensity is consistent with the Comprehensive
Development Plan of current adoption and the best interest of the county and
the incorporated towns.
   (C)   Procedure. The authorization of a unit development plan shall be
subject to the procedures expressed herein after receiving approval for a Unit
Development Plan District.
      (1)   Upon a petition of the owners of property of 50% or more of the
area involved in the petition, or upon a petition initiated by the Commission,
a preliminary plan for any area proposed for development as a unit development
plan shall be first presented to the Executive Director. At such presentation,
three copies of a preliminary plan of the proposed development, containing the
following information, shall be submitted for advice:
         (a)   Proposed dimensioned layout to scale not to exceed 100 = 1 of
any streets, buildings, open space, property divisions and other elements basic
to the proposed use in relationship to site conditions.
         (b)   Proposed locations, amounts and types of non-residential uses
within the area proposed to be developed.
         (c)   Proposed plan for handling vehicular traffic, parking, sewage
disposal, drainage, water supply, site perimeter treatment and other pertinent
development features.
         (d)   The preliminary plan may be an approximate drawing, but it shall
include any other graphic mediums which will explain the features to be
contained within the development of engineering feasibility.
         (e)   If the unit development plan is to supersede an original plat or
subdivision being vacated, the original plat shall be shown by dotted lines in
relationship to the lines of the new plan, the new plan being clearly shown in
solid lines.
         (f)   The plan shall show the boundary lines of adjacent subdivided
and unsubdivided land and the existing zoning of the area proposed to be
developed, as well as the land adjacent thereto. In the case of a petition by
owners, the plan shall also show which property within the area proposed for
development is owned by such owners.
         (g)   An enumeration of covenants, in general terms, proposed to be
made a part of the unit development plan.
         (h)   A statement expressing the order and estimated time of
development.
      (2)   Within 15 days after such presentation, the Executive Director
shall consult with the petitioner regarding the preliminary plan. After such
consultation, the petitioner may make modifications to the petition which are
deemed appropriate.
      (3)   Application for approval of the planned development shall then be
submitted to the Commission with a letter of recommendation from the Executive
Director, accompanied by six copies of the preliminary plan (with
modifications, if any) and any other desired supporting documents at a regular
meeting of the Commission as a petition for amendment of the Zoning Code and
subject to the procedures applicable thereto. The Commission may approve the
plan as amended, or disapprove the plan. The Commission may impose any
reasonable conditions upon its approval, including the recording of covenants.
If approved, the preliminary plan with amendments, if any, shall be stamped
“Approved Preliminary Unit Development Plan” and be signed by the president and
secretary of the Commission, and one copy shall be permanently retained in the
office of the Commission.
      (4)   The approved preliminary unit development plan shall then be
certified to the Board of County Commissioners of Fayette County, or the City
Council, as the case may be, for adoption as a “UD” Unit Development Plan
District pursuant to the laws governing amendment of the Zoning Code.
      (5)   Upon adoption by the respective authority, the planned development
shall be returned to the Commission which shall thereafter exercise continuing
jurisdiction. Before any development takes place, the Commission shall approve
a detailed site plan specifying the exact location, composition, and general
engineering features of all lots, drainage, sewage, water supply facilities,
recreational facilities, site perimeter treatment and other pertinent site
development features including general locations and features of proposed
buildings. Such approval shall be conditional upon finding by the Commission
that the detailed site plan is consistent with the approved Preliminary Unit
Development Plan. The approved detailed site plan shall be stamped “Approved
Detailed Unit Development Plan” and be signed by the President of the
Commission, and one copy shall be permanently retained in the office of the
Commission.
         (a)   Approval of a detailed site plan shall be obtained within one
year after adoption by the Board of County Commissioners or the City Council,
unless the Commission, upon proper application, for good cause shown, grants an
extension of time for such period as it deems is in the public interest;
provided, however, only the “Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan” shall be
required within the said one year period, and platting for recording purposes
of all or an appropriate part of the Unit Development Plan may be undertaken in
sections or phases at a later time.
         (b)   An “Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan” may mean and be
designated the same as a plat which has been granted secondary approval in
accordance with the requirements of Chapter 152, Area Subdivision Code.
         (c)   A refusal by the Commission to approve a detailed site plan
shall not be construed as a denial, and any such refusal shall not operate as a
limitation of the right of the petitioner to continue to seek approval nor
shall it impair the right of the petitioner to obtain an extension of time for
approval.
         (d)   In the event that approval of a detailed site plan is not
obtained with the one year period or an approved extension of time, the
Commission shall initiate an amendment of the Zoning Code so that the land will
be zoned into the category or categories it held before being reclassified as a
“UD” District.
      (6)   The Commission may allow the petitioner to develop the property
involved in phases. If such phasing is permitted, the Commission may allow the
petitioner to submit partial detailed site plans which correspond to the phases
involved. Such partial detailed site plans, when approved, shall be treated in
the same manner as approved detailed site plans for an entire unit development
plan.
      (7)   Where a platting, replatting or vacation of streets within all or a
portion of the land involved is contemplated, the Commission shall handle such
matters in accordance with its regular procedures in accordance with law.
      (8)   No construction or installation work shall be done on any public
improvements until satisfactory plans and specifications therefore have been
submitted to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 152,
Area Subdivision Code, and the petitioner has, at least 24 hours in advance,
notified the Executive Director of his intention to begin such work, in order
that inspections may be made as the work progresses.
      (9)   In the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, the Commission may
from time to time modify the “Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan” in a
manner consistent with the “Approved Preliminary Unit Development Plan,” to
allow for changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at the time of its
original approval.
      (10)   All development shall be in conformity with the “Approved Detailed
Unit Development Plan.” In the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, the
Commission shall take cognizance of any material deviations from the “Approved
Detailed Unit Development Plan” and take appropriate enforcement action.
      (11)   Approval by the Commission shall expire after a period of five
years from the approval of a Detailed Unit Development Plan, unless the
development is 50% completed in terms of public improvements, including
streets, parks, walkways and utility installations, in which instance an
extension of time may be granted by the Commission not to exceed five
successive periods of two years each.
      (12)   All proceedings brought under this section shall be subject to the
Rules of Procedure of the Commission, where not inconsistent with the procedure
otherwise stated herein, except that notice for proceedings related solely to
approval and modification of a detailed unit development plan.
   (D)   Abandonment or expiration. Under the abandonment of a development
authorized under this section (abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred
when no improvements have been made pursuant to the Approved Detailed Unit
Development Plan for 24 consecutive months, or under the expiration of five
years from the approval by the Commission of a Detailed Unit Development Plan
for a development which has not been completed or the expiration of an
extension granted by the Commission), the Commission shall initiate an
amendment to the Zoning Code so that the land will be zoned (or reclassified)
into a category or categories which most nearly approximate its then existing
use or such other zoning category or categories which it deems appropriate.
   (E)   Recording. An Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan and
modifications thereof shall be recorded in the appropriate plat books in the
Office of the Fayette County Recorder within two years after approval by the
Commission.
   (F)   Permit. No improvement location permit shall be issued, for a UD
District by the Executive Director unless all recording required by §
153.22(E) has been effected, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued
for a UD District unless the Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan, with
modifications, if any, is adhered to, all in compliance with the purposes Title
15: LAND USAGE, of the Code of Ordinances of Fayette County, Indiana, when the
improvement is located in the unincorporated area; and by the code of
ordinances of the city when the improvement is located within the city.
   (G)   Covenants and maintenance.
      (1)   Covenants shall be required by the Commission as an ingredient for
stability and longevity of the Unit Development Plan, and shall set forth, in
detail, provisions for the ownership and maintenance of facilities held in
common so as to reasonably insure their continuity and conservation. Said
covenant provisions shall include special remedies in the event facilities held
in common are permitted to deteriorate or are not maintained in a condition
consistent with the best interests of the county or respective town, and in
such event the county or respective town shall take those remedial steps
provided for in such provisions.
      (2)   The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any
reasonable public or semi-public purpose, including, but not limited to, the
allocation of land by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks, schools,
recreational facilities, and other public and semi-public purposes whenever
necessary in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan of current adoption. Such
covenants shall provide that if a governmental unit or agency thereof does not
proceed with acquisition of the allocated land within a specified period of
time, the covenants shall automatically terminate. If such termination occurs,
the petitioner shall then submit for approval by the Commission a modified
detailed site plan for such land consistent with the Approved Preliminary Unit
Development Plan. Such modified detailed site plans, when approved, shall be
treated in the same manner as approved detailed site plans for an entire Unit
Development Plan.
      (3)   The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any other
reasonable purpose, including, but not limited to, imposing standards for
development of property in a Unit Development Plan. Such development standards
may include, but are not limited to, requirements as to the following:
         (a)   Lot area.
         (b)   Floor area.
         (c)   Ratios of floor space to land area.

         (l)   Phasing of development.
      (4)   The petitioner shall provide financial assurance for the
satisfactory installation of all public facilities in the form of bonds or such
other assurances as are required in the normal procedures of platting pursuant
to the provisions of
Chapter 152, Area Subdivision Code.
      (5)   Adequate provision shall be made for a private organization with
direct responsibility to, and control by, the property owners involved to
provide for the operation and maintenance of all common facilities including
private streets jointly shared by such property owners if such facilities are a
part of the Unit Development Plan, and, in such instance, legal assurance shall
be provided which shows that the private organization is self-perpetuating and
adequately funded to accomplish its purposes.
      (6)   Common facilities which are not dedicated to the public shall be
maintained to standards assuring continuous and adequate maintenance at a
reasonable and non-discriminatory rate of charge to the beneficiaries thereof.
Common facilities not dedicated to the public shall be operated and maintained
at no expense to any governmental unit.
      (7)   All private streets shall be maintained by the aforesaid private
organization in such a manner that adequate access is provided at all times to

vehicles can serve the properties contiguous or adjacent thereto, and so that
said vehicles will have adequate turning area. Said private streets shall be
developed in accordance with the standards set forth in Chapter 152, Area
Subdivision Code.
   (H)   Limitation on rezoning. The Commission shall not initiate any
amendments to the Zoning Code concerning the property involved in the Unit
Development Plan before completion of the development as long as development is
in conformity with the Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan and proceeding
in accordance with the time requirements imposed herein.

§ 153.24 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Definition and basis of approval. Special exceptions are uses publicly
or municipally operated and those uses traditionally affected with a public
interest and those uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual
nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to
their impact upon neighboring property and public facilities.
      (1)   A special exception or any use not otherwise set forth in this
chapter that fits the definition set forth in division (A), herein, may be
approved in zones as specified in this section. The use approved shall be
subject to any regulations or requirements imposed as a part of the special
exception, in addition or in place of the other regulations or requirements of
this chapter. The provisions of a special exception shall replace and supersede
the provisions of the base zone, effective upon either construction of any
facilities approved as a part of the special exception or upon beginning of
operation of the use or uses specified, whichever occurs first. The provisions
shall remain in effect until such time as the special exemption use ceases to
operate. Immediately prior to reuse of the structures or facilities used for
the special exception, the provisions of the special exception shall become
invalid and the regulations and requirements of the base zone shall again be in
effect.
      (2)   Any significant changes (as determined by the Board) in the use of
a special exception or any construction of new facilities or structures, or
major additions to existing facilities or structures (as determined by the
Board) shall be subject to approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, using the
same process as was used for the original approval.
      (3)   Any use permitted under §
153.07 Non- conforming buildings and uses. If said use has been discontinued
for a period of more than two years, and if said non-conforming building or use
would not be suitable for any other purpose other than that permitted under §
153.15 LB Local business district.
   (B)   Procedure for approval. Upon receipt of an application for a special
exception, the Executive shall refer the application to the Commission for
public hearing. After said hearing (and any necessary deferrals), the
Commission shall forward a recommendation based upon the findings set forth
below, of either approval or denial, (or no recommendation if agreement is not
reached) along with all necessary stipulations, to the Board of Zoning Appeals
for public hearing and final approval or denial of the petition.
      (1)   Upon such hearings, if the Commission/Board finds that all of the
following apply:
         (a)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special
exception win not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or
general welfare;
         (b)   The special exception will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
         (c)   The establishment of the special exception will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
         (d)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
         (e)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
or egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
and
         (f)   The establishment. maintenance, or operation of the special
exception will not contravene the principles of reinvestment, revitalization
and the avoidance of unintended consequences as set forth in the Fayette County
Comprehensive Plan;
the Board shall direct the Executive Director to issue an improvement location
permit for such special exemption; otherwise, the Board shall direct the
Executive Director to reject the application. The findings of the Board and its
order to the Executive Director shall be in writing.
      (2)   The Board may impose additional conditions to assure that the
special exceptions will conform to the intent of this chapter. These additional
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the provisions of the
following:
         (a)   Off-street parking and loading areas, with particular attention
to the economic, noise, glare, or odor effects of the special exception on
adjoining properties and properties generally in the district.
         (b)   Refuse and service areas.
         (c)   Special screening and buffering with reference to type,
dimensions, and character.
         (d)   Signs and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare,
traffic, safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties
in the district.
         (e)   Additional setback distances, yards and other open space.
         (f)   General compatibility with adjoining properties, with reference
to site development standards designed for their mutual protection and the
environmental harmony of the district.
         (g)   A Development Plan in the event such a plan not already required
for a particular special exception set forth in division (E) herein, or for a
use determined by the Board to be a special exception which is not otherwise
set forth in this chapter. (See subdivision (A)(1), herein.)
         (h)   The Executive Director may require a land survey if he
determines it is necessary for the proper identification of the boundaries of
the special exception.
      (3)   If the nature of this special exception involves more than one of
those listed, the applicant may apply for an improvement location permit for
the special exceptions which most closely relates to the primary use; provided
that the requirements of the related uses will be met.
      (4)   Any person, to whom is issued an improvement location permit for a
special exception, who fails to commence construction within 12 months after
such permit is issued, or who fails to carry to completion the total
development plan thereof within three years after such construction is begun,
whichever is later, or who fails to conform to the provisions of the
development plan and supporting data finally approved by the Board and upon the
basis of which such improvement location permit was issued, may be required by
the Board upon its own motion, and shall be required by the Board upon written
petition of any person deeming himself aggrieved, to show cause why such
approval should not be withdrawn and such improvement location permit revoked.
      (5)   The holder of an improvement location permit for a special
exception may apply to the Board at any time for an alteration, change,
amendment or extension of the application or development plan upon which such
permit was based.
         (a)   Upon receipt of such application, the Board shall proceed as in
the case of original applications for an improvement location permit for a
special exception.
         (b)   In the event the Board shall approve and order such application
or development plan changed, altered, amended or extended, it shall notify the
Executive Director who shall issue an amended improvement location permit
accordingly.
   (C)   Existing use may be a conforming use. An existing use which is listed
herein as a special exception, and which is located in a district in which such
special exception may be permitted, is a conforming use, provided such use
meets the minimum lot area requirements set forth herein. Any expansion of such
special exception involving the enlargement of a building, structure, and land
area devoted to such use, shall be subject to the requirements and procedures
described in this section.
   (D)   Temporary certificates. Whenever a special exception has been approved
and is of such a nature that the applicant desires to complete the structure
and improvements shown in the development plan by
stages, the applicant may make application for a temporary certificate of
occupancy for any portion of the plan that has been completed.
   (E)   Special exceptions and districts where they may be permitted. The
following uses shall require approval as special exceptions. They shall be
subject to the specific conditions imposed and approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals:

§ 153.35 HOME BASED BUSINESSES AND RURAL HOME BASED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   This section authorizes as home-based businesses and rural home
based businesses all uses that conform to its standards. In general, a home-
based business is an accessory use located and operated in a manner that
neighbors, under normal circumstances would be unaware of its existence other
than a sign or a small number of additional visitors and deliveries. To
establish whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a home-based business
or rural home based business, standards have been set to ensure compatibility
with permitted uses, to maintain neighborhood character (whether urban or rural
residential or agriculture), and to clearly indicate a status that is secondary
or incidental to an existing and occupied dwelling unit. Additionally, home-
based business uses are classed as Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 based on the
intensity of said use requiring greater degrees of scrutiny as part of the
permitting process.
         (a)   Tier 1. No permit required for home offices, telecommuting,
internet based businesses including internet sales and similar uses that do not
require signs and visitors. Home crafts and individually ordered and/or
customized items including wood working, sale of produce raised on property, in
rural districts agricultural and natural resource products raised and/or
processed on property where dwelling is located.
         (b)   Tier 2. Staff approval for uses that require signs or no more
than one visitor at one time, no employees other than family, personal
services, business services, individual instruction including tutoring and
personal training, individual counseling; one station barber or beauty shop
including manicure, no more than two transient guest rooms.
         (c)   Tier 3. Approval by Board of Zoning Appeals, special instruction
whose class sizes do not exceed five, group counseling not exceeding five; two
station barber or beauty shop including manicure, any business that employs
persons outside of the immediate household, catering service (requires Health
Department approval and/or licensing, may require an Indiana Design Release).
Use of existing accessory building, areas greater than 600 square feet will
require Class 1 Change of Use Design Release from Indiana Department of
Homeland Security.
      (2)   Because compatibility with permitted uses and neighborhood
character vary with location and zoning, this section distinguishes what may be
suited to all living environments and what may be uniquely suited to
agriculture and rural settings. Home-based businesses and rural home based
businesses conforming to the requirements of this section are permitted as
residential accessory uses.
   (B)   Procedure for approval. Upon receipt of an application for a home
based business, the Executive Director shall review the application for
completeness and the appropriate Tier. If the requested home based business
qualifies as a Tier 1 Home Based Business no permit is required. If the
requested home based business qualifies as a Tier 2 Home Based Business Area
Plan Commission staff shall issue the home based permit. If the requested home
based business qualifies as a Tier 3 Home Based Business Area Plan Commission
staff shall forward the application as a petition to the Board of Zoning
Appeals for a public hearing as special exception (69) Tier 3 Home Based
Business.
   (C)   Home-based business use requirements. In addition to all other
requirements applicable in the zone in which located, home-based businesses are

      (1)   Dwelling units, 25% of living area with a maximum area 600 square
feet.
      (2)   Accessory buildings of 600 square feet. Greater than 600 square

building or to the lot which changes the residential character of the building
or lot. Additions are permitted provided the appearance and character of the
addition is consistent with the residential character of the neighborhood.
      (4)   The operator of a home-based business shall be a resident of the
building property and no employees are allowed who are not residents other than
as approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a Tier 3 home-based business.
      (5)   A home-based business shall not involve construction features or
the use of any equipment or combustible materials any of which would change
fire separation requirements of the primary use building.
      (6)   There can be no activity or storage related to the home-based
business outside the primary use building other than as approved by the Board
of Zoning Appeals as a Tier 3 home-based business.
      (7)   A home-based business shall provide additional off-street parking
sufficient to meet needs created by the home-based business and the existing
residential use and shall be provided on the same lot as the home-based
business and may be located in the front yard setback. On-street parking
directly in front of the dwelling may be allowed only as a Tier 2 or 3 home-
based business, but only where formal on-street parking exists.

§ 153.36 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of these parking standards is to reduce street

provide parking which is consistent with the use and the standards for the
zoning district in which the use would be ordinarily permitted by this chapter.
In no case shall the number of parking spaces required for non-conforming uses
or those permitted by special exception or variance be solely based on the
standards for the district in which they are located. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall specify the number of parking spaces for all uses permitted by
special exception or variance consistent with the intent of this section.
However, the BZA may grant variances consistent with the intent of this
subchapter.
      (3)   Requirements for uses not specifically listed. The number of

Area Zoning Code and not less than 30 days for other violations before the
issuance of the ticket/violation to correct the violation.
      (3)   A person who receives a “notice of violation” or a ticket/citation
may file a formal appeal of the Executive Director’s order or zoning code
interpretation to the Board of Zoning Appeals, or file a petition for a
variance, special exception conditional use, rezoning or other means provided
by the Area Zoning Code to correct the violation. A person who elects to file
an appeal or petition shall indicate this intent on the “notice of violation”
or ticket/citation and return it to the Area Plan Commission staff within ten
days, after issuance of the “notice of violation” or ticket/citation to file
the appeal of petition. A person who files the petition within said time period
shall be responsible for completing all required applications and petition
paper work and shall be responsible for all public notice costs with the
hearing(s) to be held at the next available Area Plan Commission and Board of
Zoning Code. If the appeal or petition is denied, withdrawn, or dismissed for
want of prosecution, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall establish a time limit
for correction of the violation, not to exceed 30 days. No fines shall be
assessed during the correction period. After the expiration of the correction
period, if the civil zoning violation continues at the real estate, then
enforcement proceedings authorized by this section will be commenced. A person
who receives a citation under this section and elects to file a petition shall
not be entitled to a stay of additional monetary fines that accrue after the
expiration of any correction period.
      (4)   A person who receives a ticket/citation may elect to pay the fine
and any associated court costs to the appropriate office, or to stand trial for
the offense by indicating on the citation his or her intent to stand trial and
returning a copy of the ticket/citation to the issuing agency.
      (5)   If a person who receives a ticket/citation fails to pay the
assessed fine by the date of payment set forth in the ticket/citation and fails
to notice of his or her intention to stand trial as prescribed in division (D)
(4) above, the Plan Commission Attorney may file enforcement proceedings as
provided by applicable laws and seek penalties as prescribed in this chapter.
      (6)   A person adjudged to have committed a civil zoning violation is
liable for the court costs and fees. No cost shall be assessed against the
enforcement agency in any such action.
      (7)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized by this chapter does not
preclude the county from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action, or from seeking injunctive relief or any other remedy in a separate
action for the enforcement of this chapter.
      (8)   A change of venue from Fayette County shall not be granted in such
a case, as provided in IC 36-7-4-1014.
   (E)   Unpaid fines and court costs and attorney fees incurred to enforce
chapter to become lien against real estate.
      (1)   Any fine and court costs not paid within 30 days after it is due
shall result in said fine and court costs along with the amount of any attorney
fees incurred to enforce this chapter to become a lien
against the real property on which the violation of this chapter occurred.
      (2)   The lien attaches to the real property when notice of the lien is
recorded in the Office of the Fayette County Recorder. The lien is superior to
all other liens except liens for taxes.
      (3)   The lien shall be in an amount that does not exceed:
         (a)   $2,500 for real property that:
            1.   Contains one or more occupied or unoccupied single or double
family dwellings or the appurtenances or additions to those dwellings; or
            2.   Is unimproved;
         (b)   $10,000 for all other real property not described in division
(E)(3)(a).
      (4)   The amount of the lien shall be placed on the tax duplicate by the
Fayette County Auditor. The total amount, including any accrued interest, shall
be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be
disbursed to the General Fund of the County.
   (F)   Violations on private property costs of remediation billed to owner
and if not paid to become a lien against the real estate.
      (1)   If a condition violating this section exists on real property,
officers and employees of Fayette County or a contractor of the county may
enter onto that real property and take appropriate action to bring the real
property into compliance with this section. However, before action to bring
compliance may be taken, all persons holding a substantial interest in the
property must be given reasonable opportunity of at least ten days but not more
than 60 days to bring the property into compliance. If the county takes action
to bring compliance, the expenses incurred by the county to bring compliance
constitute a lien against the real property.
      (2)   The lien attaches when notice of the lien is recorded in the Office
of the Fayette County Recorder. The lien is superior to all other liens except
for taxes, in an amount that does not exceed:
         (a)   $2,500 for real property that:
            1.   Contains one or more occupied or unoccupied single or double
family dwellings or the appurtenances or additions to those dwellings; or
            2.   Is unimproved;
         (b)   $10,000 for all other real property not described in division
(F)(2)(a).

   (G)   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request regulatory
flood data, SFHA maps, copies of DNR permits and letters of recommendation,
federal permit documents, and “as built” elevation and floodproofing data for
all buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
(Ord. 3140, passed 5-3-93)
§ 154.05 REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering
study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation and floodway limits for the SFHAs
delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of Fayette County
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Department of
Natural Resources.

§ 154.06 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT.
   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by state law
shall commence any “development” in the SFHA without first obtaining an
improvement location permit from the Area Plan Commission. The Area Plan
Commission shall not issue an improvement location permit if the proposed
“development” does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for an improvement location permit shall be
accompanied by the following:
      (1)   A description of the proposed development.
      (2)   Location of the proposed development, sufficient to accurately
locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams.
      (3)   A legal description of the property site.
      (4)   A site development plan showing existing and proposed structure
locations and existing and proposed land grades.
      (5)   Elevation of lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed
structures. Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD).
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit, the
Building Official shall determine if the site is located within an identified
floodway or within the floodplain where the limits of the floodway have not yet
been determined.
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodway the Building Official
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
         (a)   Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit from the Natural
Resources Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local building
permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity
located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as
filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the building.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until a permit
has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission, the Building Official may issue the local improvement
location permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
154.07 and
154.08 of this chapter have been met. The improvement location permit cannot be
less restrictive than the permit issued by the Natural Resources Commission.
      (2)   If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the
Building Official may issue the local improvement location permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
154.07 and
154.08 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the lowest
floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the
Flood Protection Grade.
      (3)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined (shown as Zone A on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map), and the drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile, the Building Official shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
         (a)   No action shall be taken by the Building Official until either a
permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation citing
the 100 year flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Department of Natural Resources.
         (b)   Once the Building Official has received the proper permit or
letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an improvement
location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the ILP are not less
restrictive than the conditions received from Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in §§
154.07 and
154.08 of this chapter have been met.
(Ord. 3140, passed 5-3-93)
§ 154.07 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.
   No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   (A)   Within the floodway identified on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map
or the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the following standards shall apply:
      (1)   No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in
combination with existing or future similar works, will cause any increase in
the elevation of the regulatory flood; and
      (2)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) Fayette County shall submit a request to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.
   (B)   Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100 year flood elevation
and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided) the following
standard shall apply:
      (1)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   (C)   Public health standards in all SFHAs:
      (1)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection grade, unless
such materials are stored in a storage tank or floodproofed building
constructed according to the requirements of §
154.08 of this chapter.
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground openings
located below the FPG are watertight.
(Ord. 3140, passed 5-3-93)
§ 154.08 PROTECTING BUILDINGS.
   In addition to the damage prevention requirements of §
154.07, all buildings to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the FPG.
   (A)   This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of any new building valued at more than
$1,000 or having greater than 400 square feet, whichever is less;
      (2)   Structural alterations made to an existing building that increase
the market value of the building by more than 50% (excluding the value of the
land) or any structural alteration made previously (one time only alteration);
      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are
valued at or more than 50% of the market value of the building (excluding the
value of the land) before damage occurred;
      (4)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning the existing
manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed
to avoid flood damage; and
      (5)   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days.
   (B)   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the
following methods. The Building Official shall maintain a record of compliance
with these building protection standards as required in §
154.04 of this chapter.
      (1)   A residential or non-residential building may be constructed on a
permanent landfill in accordance with the following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method.
         (b)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation
of the building before sloping below the FPG.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The lowest floor (see definition of lowest floor in § 154.03)
shall be at or above the FPG.
      (2)   A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on posts, piers,
columns, extended walls, or other types of similar foundation provided:
            1.   Walls of any enclosure below the elevated floor shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, through providing a minimum of
two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) having a total area of one
square foot for every two square feet of enclosed area subject to flooding. The
bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
            2.   Any enclosure below the elevated floor is used for non-
residential purposes and building access.
         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and
aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize
exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice, and floating
debris.
         (c)   All areas below the FPG shall be constructed of materials

(Ord. 5167, passed 9-20-09)
§ 155.04 HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS, AND GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Recommendations. All recommendations for the establishment of a
historic district shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on
the criteria outlined in this section. A recommendation for establishing a
historic district may be initiated from either of the following two sources:
      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit historic
district maps for City Council approval.
      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a historic
district which includes their property may petition the Commission to consider
drawing and submitting a map or maps of said property to the City Council for
its approval. The Commission may establish in its rules criteria to be met
before it considers a petition.
   (B)   Conservation districts. The Commission may recommend and the City
Council may provide that the establishment of a historic district shall occur
in two phases. During the first phase, which continues
for a period of three years from the date the ordinance is adopted, a
certificate of appropriateness is required for the following activities: the
demolition of any building; the moving of any building; and any new
construction of a principal building or accessory building or structure subject
to view from a public way.
      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the first phase
of a conservation district continues and the second phase does not become
effective if a majority of the property owners in the district object to the
Commission, in writing, to the requirement that certificates of appropriateness
be issued for the following activities:
         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of historic
buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance involving
exterior color changes;
         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of walls and
fences, if along public ways;
         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of non-historic
buildings subject to view from a public way by additions, reconstruction,
alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.
      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must be
received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance.
   (C)   Commission preparation of historic district maps. In order to
establish a historic district, the Commission shall first prepare a map
describing the district in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the Commission
which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located within the
City.
      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a property
containing a single building, structure, or site.
      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and secondary areas as
follows:
         (a)   Primary area. The principal area of historic and architectural
significance.
         (b)   Secondary area. An area adjacent to a primary area which has a
visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of
the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its
compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.
   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall classify and designate on the map all
buildings, structures, and sites within each historic district described on the
map. Buildings, structures, and sites must possess identified historic or
architectural merit of a degree warranting their preservation. The Commission
shall further classify and designate all buildings and structures within a
proposed historic district as follows:
         (a)   Outstanding;
         (b)   Notable; or
         (c)   Contributing.
      (2)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those not
classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the
Commission may devise its own system of further classification of historic
buildings, structures, and sites.
   (E)   City Council approval of maps of historic districts. Before a historic
district is established and the building classifications take effect, the map
setting forth the district's boundaries and building classifications must be
submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the City Council.
   (F)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing boundaries of
a historic district may be recorded in the office of the county recorder.
(Ord. 5167, passed 9-20-09)
§ 155.05 INTERIM PROTECTION.
   (A)   When submitting a map to the City Council under §
155.04 of this chapter, the Commission may declare one or more buildings or
structures that are classified and designated as historic on the map to be
under interim protection.
   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building, structure,
or site to be under interim protection under this section, the Commission
shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner or occupant
of the building, structure, or site with a written notice of the declaration.
The written notice must:
