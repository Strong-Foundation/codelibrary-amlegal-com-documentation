§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Bunker Hill Town
Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances” or

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section

previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.

the error.

not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.

(Ord. 2-2017, passed 7-10-2017)
§ 30.03 MEETINGS.
   (A)   General information.
      (1)   All Town Council members are required to attend a monthly meeting,
and all other meetings called by the President. If a Town Council member moves
out of town, is convicted with a felony or wishes to resign, he or she shall
submit a resignation letter to both the Council as well as to voters
registration. The Town Council will announce to the public the vacancy and
shall notify the party’s committee. If the party’s committee does not replace
the member within 30 days, then the Town Council will vote with the majority
present for a replacement.
      (2)   All members shall be paid according to the current wage and salary
ordinance. Town Council members will be paid the pay period that directly falls
after the town’s first regular meeting of the month. Direct deposit is
available. There is also a process for those members who do not wish to
receive payment for their services.
   (B)   Regular monthly meetings.
      (1)   The Town Council will meet regularly on the second Monday of each
month in the Town Community Center. When the second Monday falls on a federal
or state holiday, the regular meetings shall be held on the following day. The
day, time and place of the meeting may be changed by a majority vote of the

      (2)   The meeting dates will be set at the first meeting of January. It
will be advertised in the local newspaper and posted at the Town Clerk-
Treasurer’s office.
      (3)   Unless otherwise voted upon by a majority of the Town Council, all
meetings will begin at 6:30 p.m. and adjourn by 8:00 p.m. If necessary or
requested, an extension can be voted on. Any extension shall be for 15 minutes
only, and no more than two 15-minute extensions shall be allowed at any one
meeting without a two-thirds’ vote of the members present to change the time of
adjournment.
   (C)   Special meetings. Special meetings are held between regular meetings.
Any member of the Town Council can request a special meeting, but the specific
business must be such that it cannot wait until the next regularly scheduled
Town Council meeting. The President decides if a special meeting is warranted
or not and has the final say in the matter. Boards are required to give
adequate notice of the special meeting and allow public attendance at such
meetings. These meetings will follow the same guidelines as the regular monthly
meeting.
   (D)   Executive meetings. Executive meetings may be called for by any
Council member and address issues involving privileged information and matters

will be considered. The President decides if an executive meeting is warranted
or not and has the final say in the matter. Boards are required to give notice
of the executive meeting, but the public does not have the right to attend
these. No recordings or written minutes are kept of the proceedings, except
those used by members during the executive meeting. Discussion is kept
confidential between the Council members and the individual(s) directly
involved in the meeting. Any decisions requiring a vote will be taken at the
next Town Council meeting.
   (E)   Emergency meetings. An emergency meeting will be called if extreme
circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen which require
immediate attention and possible action by the Town Council and which out of
necessity make it impractical or impossible to provide notice to the public. In
the case of an emergency, whether declared on a national, state or county
level, the Town Council may postpone or cancel a meeting by the Town Council
President with a majority vote from the Town Council members by either verbal
or electronic messaging. The postponement shall be posted, if possible, on the
town’s website as soon as practicable after the vote is taken.
(Ord. 2-2017, passed 7-10-2017)
§ 30.04 AGENDA.
   (A)   The Town Council utilizes the agenda to provide an outline of the
order of business for the meeting. The Town Council maintains the right to add
or amend items from the agenda as necessary. The agenda will be posted at the
Town Clerk-Treasurer and Utility Clerk’s office door and on both doors of the
Town Hall Building. Copies of the agenda shall be made readily available to the
public during office hours at the Town Clerk-Treasurer’s office. Notice of
regular monthly meetings will be published in the local newspaper one time at
the beginning of the year. Additional meetings (special, executive or public
hearing) will be run in the newspaper no less than 48 hours prior to the day of
the meeting.
   (B)   The agenda is set by the Town Clerk-Treasurer and the Town Council
President seven days prior to the meeting. Each department is responsible to
provide its Town Council representative with its monthly report by 12:00 p.m.
on the Thursday prior to the Town Council meeting. The departments are not
required to attend the meeting, and compensation will not be given for
attendance unless their presence is required by the Town Clerk-Treasurer and/or
Town Council President. All request forms must be turned in by 12:00 p.m. on
the Thursday prior to the Town Council meeting to be considered for payment.
Late request forms will be held until the next monthly meeting.
      (1)   Call to order. The Town Council President will welcome Town Council
members and public and announce the time and state that the meeting will begin.
All cell phones are to be silenced at this time. The President will request
that all stand to face the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
      (2)   Roll call and determination of a quorum. The Town Clerk-Treasurer
will then call the roll to determine if a quorum is present and to identify the
members of the Town Council, the Town Attorney and the Town Marshal, who also
functions as Sergeant-at-Arms during the meeting. A quorum for the Town Council
is a minimum of three of the five members present. If a quorum is present, the
meeting will continue. If not, it will be determined if the absent member(s)
will be present or not. If so, the President can request a ten-minute delay,
after which the same procedure as if the absent member will not be in
attendance will be followed. If there is no quorum, the meeting will be
postponed until the following day. The Town Clerk-Treasurer shall keep his or
her minutes in a correct record of attendance of the Council members at
meetings of the Council and of all the motions/seconds and individual votes of
said Council members.
      (3)   Acceptance of minutes. The President will ask if there is a motion
to accept the minutes of the previous meeting. This requires a motion or a
second and recorded voice vote.
      (4)   Claims. At this time, claims will be reviewed by the Council
members. All claims for payment must be provided to the Town Clerk-Treasurer by
the Thursday prior to the meeting to be considered for payment. Claims received
after that time will be subject to the discretion of the Town Clerk-Treasurer
and/or Town Council President. At this time, claims will be reviewed by the
Council members. Claims can only be paid by the Town Clerk-Treasurer; no
Council member or department head can authorize payment of any bills or make
promises of payment.
      (5)   Public comments.
         (a)   The President will ask for the attendance sheet from which he or
she will know if there is anyone from the public audience who wishes to speak
or make a comment. The attendance sheet will have the date, name, address and
yes/no checkmark to indicate intention to speak. Public comments are welcome
and encouraged. The President will take public comments in the order listed. He
or she will identify the individual then ask them to address the Council. No
one may speak without the acknowledgment of the Council President. There is a
two-minute time limit for the comment, unless there are specific questions from
the Town Council for that individual on that specific topic, then one two-
minute extension will be allowed for the answer. Personal attacks of a
malicious nature will not be tolerated, and the President will order that
person to cease or risk being removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
         (b)   The public shall have a reasonable right to participate in any
matter being considered by the Town Council. They will be held to the same
standards of conduct and decorum as the Town Council members and subject to the
same limitations. The Council will make reasonable efforts to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and accommodate any other special needs of the
public. Members of the public shall have the right to bring before the Council
issues of public concern. This section does not apply to executive sessions of
the Town Council held under I.C. 5-14-1.5, the State Open Door Law, as it is
from time to time amended. Public comments will also be accepted prior to
voting on any ordinances and/or resolutions subject to the same two-minute time
limit and guidelines as for public comments.
      (6)   Unfinished business. Unfinished business, as determined by the Town
Clerk-Treasurer and/or Town Council President, is based on prior meetings. This

benefits, discussions of personnel and reading of ordinances. It shall also
include anything that is out of the ordinary for general Council meetings.
      (8)   New business. New business, as determined by the Town Clerk-
Treasurer and/or Town Council President, shall include any last minute
information or changes. Any items tabled or not acted upon shall remain on the
regular meetings agenda or special meeting if called for that particular item.
      (9)   Approval of requests. Requests received by the Town Clerk-Treasurer
by 12:00 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the meeting will be discussed and voted
on at this time. Requests received after Thursday at 12:00 p.m. will be held

      (3)   These subsidiary motions are listed here in their order of
importance to the principal motion, but must be considered in the reverse
order. Thus a motion “to lay on the table” comes before all others, while a
motion “to amend” takes precedence only over a motion “to postpone
indefinitely.”
   (C)   Incidental motions.
      (1)   An incidental motion is one that comes up incidentally when other
motions are being considered and must be disposed of before the principal
motion or a subsidiary motion can be acted upon.
      (2)   The incidental motions are:
         (a)   To suspend the rules;
         (b)   To withdraw a motion;
         (c)   Reading of papers;
         (d)   Objection to consideration of a question; and
         (e)   Appeals (from decision of President, division of house or point
of order).
   (D)   Privileged motions.
      (1)   A privileged motion is one relating to the well-being of the group
or of any of its members. Because of its importance to individual members it
takes precedence over all other questions.
      (2)   The privileged motions are:
         (a)   Orders of the day;
         (b)   Questions of privilege;
         (c)   To take a recess;
         (d)   To adjourn; and
         (e)   To fix time to adjourn.
      (3)   These privileged motions are also listed in their order of
importance to the principal motion, but must be taken up in the reverse order.
Thus a motion “to fix the time to adjourn” must be considered first, next a
motion “to adjourn” and then a motion “to take a recess.”
(Ord. 2-2017, passed 7-10-2017)
§ 30.06 MAKING OR AMENDING A MOTION.
   (A)   Making a motion. The following procedure is recognized and will be
utilized by the Town Council:
      (1)   Obtain the floor as follows: raise your hand and address the
President, saying “Mr. President or Madam President.” The President will then
recognize the speaker by saying, “Mr. Smith or Miss/Mrs. Jones.” The speaker
may not present the motion until recognized by the President.
      (2)   State the motion carefully: This is done by saying, “I move that
            .”
      (3)   The motion must then be seconded. It cannot be discussed unless
there is a second. If there is no second, the motion is lost. To second a
motion, the words, “I second the motion” are used.
      (4)   The President must repeat the motion in full, by saying, “The
motion has been made and seconded that                 . Is there any
discussion?”
      (5)   The motion is then open for discussion by the Council. This is done
by the same process as when making a motion. A good President will encourage as
much discussion as possible. In this way, the facts and merits of the question
are brought out and the members can vote more intelligently. Thorough
discussion often prevents people from being dissatisfied afterwards. The person
who made the motion is given the opportunity to open and close the discussion.
Again, the two-minute time limit must be observed.
      (6)   After the discussion, a voice vote is taken by the President. The
Town Clerk-Treasurer will record the “ayes” and “nays” in the minutes. If an
ordinance or resolution is voted on, then the Town Clerk-Treasurer sill make a
roll call vote and record it in the minutes.
   (B)   How to amend a motion.
      (1)   An amendment to a motion is really a new motion made to change or
modify the previous motion which is under consideration. An amendment may do
one of four things:
         (a)   Add or insert a certain word or words, or a sentence, to the
motion under consideration;
         (b)   Strike out a certain word, or words, or sentence, in the motion
under consideration;
         (c)   Substitute another motion for the one being considered; or
         (d)   Substitute words or replace wording under consideration.
      (2)   An amendment, like a main/principal motion, must be second. It is
also debatable, and may again be amended. The proper form for making an
amendment is: “I move to amend the motion to read              ” or “I move to
amend the motion by         .”
      (3)   The amendment to a motion, if seconded, must be voted upon before
the original motion. If the amendment to the motion is carried, the original
motion, must be voted upon as amended. On the other hand, if the amendment is
lost, the motion is voted upon as originally stated.
      (4)   In case of an amendment to an amendment, the last amendment is
always voted upon first. If it is carried, the preceding amendment is then
voted upon as amended.
(Ord. 2-2017, passed 7-10-2017)
§ 30.07 RULES OF DEBATE; DECORUM AND ETHICS.
   It is the responsibility of the Town Council President to maintain
professional order during the meeting.
   (A)   To obtain the floor, the member must raise a hand and address the
President by saying, “Mr. or Madam President.” The President recognizes the
member by saying the member’s name, “Mr. Smith or Miss/Mrs. Jones.” If the
request is to speak on the issue at hand, the President will the member allow
two minutes to present his or her point. After two minutes are up, the Council
member must wait until all other Council members are given the opportunity to
speak on that topic before requesting to speak again on the same topic. The
two-minute rule applies to all members equally. Members should not speak more
than twice on any motion. Members are not allowed to yield their unelapsed time
to another member to allow one member a particularly long speech.
   (B)   When a Council member is speaking, no one other than the President can
interrupt him or her. The Council member must confine his or her remarks to the
matter that is under debate only. The use of obscene, threatening, derogatory
or inflammatory language will be grounds for immediate dismissal from that
meeting. Council members and the public are advised that any private
conversation, unnecessary noise, moving about or leaving the room unnecessarily
will be grounds for dismissal from the meeting.
   (C)   Furthermore, if any member in any way transgresses the rules of the
Council, any of the other members or the President may call him or her to
order, in which case the alleged offender shall immediately cease and desist
such activity, unless permitted to explain.
   (D)   If the alleged offender continues his or her behavior, the President
may call upon the Town Marshal to act in his or her capacity as Sergeant-at-
Arms to escort the individual from the meeting room and/or building. Before the
Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to remove the offender, he or she will be given
one warning from the President to cease the behavior. If, at anytime, the Town
Marshal has a concern regarding the safety or welfare of any individual or
individuals, he or she may use his or her own discretion.
   (E)   Any of the following shall be sufficient cause for removal from the
room/building for the duration of the meeting:
      (1)   Unreasonably loud or disruptive language, noise (this includes
disruptive cell phone usage) or conduct that obstructs the work or the
conduction of Council business;
      (2)   Refusal to obey the rules of conduct provided in this chapter,
including the limitation of occupancy and seating capacity as determined by the
Fire Marshal;
      (3)   Refusal to obey an order of the President or an order issued by a
Council member which has been approved by a majority of the Council present;
and
      (4)   If a meeting is disrupted by members of the audience, the President
or a majority of the Council present may order that the Council room or
building be cleared.
(Ord. 2-2017, passed 7-10-2017)
§ 30.08 NON-PUBLIC MEETINGS.
   (A)   The Council shall not have a majority of members meet without
considering that to be a public meeting. The Town Council shall follow I.C. 5-
14-1.5-3.1 for serial meetings.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (A)(2) below, the governing body of

      (2)   All the gatherings concern the same subject matter and are held

      (3)   The gatherings are held to take official action on public business.
For the purpose of this division (A), a member of a governing body attends a

electronic mail.
   (B)   A gathering under division (A) above does not include:
      (1)   A social or chance gathering not intended by any member of the

      (2)   An on-site inspection of any:

responsibilities as public officials, but not for any other official action;
      (7)   A gathering for the sole purpose of administering an oath of office
to an individual; and
      (8)   A gathering between less than a quorum of the members of the
governing body intended solely for members to receive information and
deliberate on whether a member or members may be inclined to support a member’s
proposal or a particular piece of legislation and at which no other official
action will occur.
   (C)   A violation described in division (A)(1) above is subject to §
10.99. See Pub. Law No. 179-2007, § 4.

room number and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:

on the bill; and
      (2)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second bill
will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid within
ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment; and
      (3)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his bill shall have
a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in person and
by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may present orally or

of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the
customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a
final determination of the customer’s complaint.
   (B)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.

made in the same manner as in §
51.44(A)(3) and (A)(4).
(Am. Ord. 4, 2018, passed 5-21-2019)
§ 51.44 SEWER BILL ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Generally speaking, what happens to the water after it leaves the
meter is the responsibility of the customer. At times however, through no one’s
fault, leaks do develop that are not detectable until receipt of the water bill
and, therefore, it is only fair that an adjustment be made. The following
procedure will be used to determine a leak adjustment.
      (1)   Customer will be informed of a dramatic increase of water usage.
      (2)   Within seven working days, the customer shall reply that a leak
does or does not exist and when the repairs are anticipated to be completed.
The Utility Department will then be notified upon completion of said repairs.
Receipts may be required.
      (3)   No adjustments to the sewer bill will be made for a leak that was
of a visible or easily determined problem. Below are some examples of what
circumstances will and will not be eligible for adjustment. The following is by
no means an exhaustive list. The customer is responsible for leaks that are
preventable and adjustments may be made to the others.
Item Sewage
Item                                         Sewage
Filling of pool w/garden hose                Yes
Garden/hose left running                     Yes
Leak in basement/crawl space                 Yes
Leak in buried piping                        Yes
Leak under skirting of mobile home           Yes
Leaking faucet or commode                    Yes
Water left running to prevent pipe freeze-up Yes
 
      (4)   If a customer runs their water to prevent pipes from freezing, he
or she shall be allowed up to 200 gallons a month in an adjustment.
      (5)   If an adjustment is in order, the Clerk-Treasurer’s office will
determine a period of previous usage that was reasonably consistent over a
period of four months to determine an average usage. The average usage will be
subtracted from the usage during the month(s) the leak existed, and the
difference will then constitute the number of gallons of the adjustment.
      (6)   No account may be adjusted more than twice in a 12-month period.
      (7)   Any account holder that would like an adjustment over $200, must
fill out a request form. The account holder will bring their request (with all
supporting documents) to the Utility Clerk’s office. Once received, a
determination shall be made within 30 days.
   (B)   (1)   Any account holder requesting his or her pool to be filled by
the town fire hydrants must pay a $25 connect fee and schedule an appointment
with the Town Foreperson.
      (2)   A meter will be placed on the hydrant for a reading.
      (3)   Once the Utility Clerk receives the reading, the amount will be
adjusted to the next month’s utility bill.

and stored in a suitable place. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles shall be notified
within 72 hours of the location and description of the vehicle. Upon receipt of
notification, the Bureau shall cause a search to be made to determine and
notify the person who owns the vehicle. If the person who owns a vehicle cannot
be determined by a search, the Bureau shall declare the vehicle abandoned and
provide for disposal. If the properly identified person who owns or holds a
lien on a vehicle appears at the site or storage before disposal of the vehicle
or parts and pays all costs incurred against the vehicle or parts at that time,
the vehicle or parts shall be released. The release must state the name,
signature and address of the person who owns or holds a lien on the vehicle, a
description of the vehicle or parts, costs and date of release. A towing
operator shall notify the Bureau of all releases. If the person who owns or
holds a lien does not appear and pay all costs, the Bureau shall declare the
vehicle abandoned and provide for disposal.
   (B)   (1)   When the Town Marshal finds or is notified of a vehicle or parts
believed to be abandoned, he or she shall attach in a prominent place a notice
tag containing the following information:

of the vehicle or parts within 72 hours.
      (2)   If a vehicle or a part tagged is not removed within the 72-hour
period, the officer shall prepare a written abandoned vehicle report or the
vehicle or parts, including information on the condition, missing parts and
other facts that might substantiate the estimated market value of the vehicle
or parts. Photographs shall be taken to describe the condition of the vehicle
or parts. If, in the opinion of the Town Marshal, the market value of an
abandoned vehicle or parts are less than $100, the Town Marshal shall
immediately dispose of the vehicle to an automobile scrapyard. A copy of the
abandoned vehicle shall be forwarded to the Bureau. The Town Marshal disposing
of the vehicle shall retain the original records and photographs for at least
two years. If, in the opinion of the Town Marshal, the market value of the
abandoned vehicle or parts is at least $100, the Town Marshal, before placing a
notice tag on the vehicle or parts, shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain
the person who owns the vehicle or parts or who may be in control of the
vehicle or parts. After 72 hours, the Town Marshal shall require the vehicle or
parts to be towed to a storage area.

         (d)   That the person who owns the vehicle will be held responsible
for all costs incidental to the removal, storage and disposal of the vehicle;
and
         (e)   That the person who owns the vehicle may avoid costs by removal
of the vehicle or parts within 72 hours.
      (2)   If, after 72 hours, the person who owns a vehicle believed to be
abandoned on rental property has not removed the vehicle from the rental
property, the person who owns the rental property may have the vehicle towed
from the rental property. The towing operator shall do the following:
         (a)   Contact the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to obtain the name and
address of the person who owns the vehicle; and
         (b)   Deliver, by certified mail, a copy of the information contained
in the notice required to the person who owns the vehicle. The notice required
by this division (C)(2)(b) must be given not later than five business days
after the vehicle is removed.
      (3)   In an emergency situation, a vehicle may be removed immediately. As
used in this division (C)(3), EMERGENCY SITUATION means that the presence of
the abandoned vehicle interferes physically with the conduct of normal business
operations of the owner of the rental property or poses a threat to the safety
or security of persons or property, or both.
   (D)   Upon complaint of a person who owns or controls private property that
a vehicle has been left on the property for at least 48 hours without the
consent of the person who owns or controls the property, the Town Marshal shall

Section I
1-1 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the “Subdivision
Regulation of the Town of Bunker Hill, Miami County, Indiana.”
1-2 POLICY.
   (1)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the town to consider the
subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat as
subject to the official Comprehensive Plan and related policies for the orderly
and efficient development of the town.
   (2)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be
developed without peril to health from flood, fire or other menace and land
shall not be subdivided until having access to available existing public
facilities and until improvements and proper provision have been made for
drainage, water, sewerage, other necessary new public improvements such as
schools, parks, recreation facilities and transportation facilities adequate
for serving the subdivision. Private wells and septic systems in lieu of public
water and sewer facilities are allowable where permitted under the Town of
Bunker Hill Zoning Ordinance and approved by the County Health Department.
   (3)   Both existing and proposed public facilities serving the subdivision
shall be properly related and conform to the official Town Comprehensive Land
Use Plan, related policies and implementation programs including the Capital
Budget, Official Map, Thoroughfare Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Housing and
Building Codes.
1-3 PURPOSES OF THESE REGULATIONS.
   (1)   To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general
welfare of the town;
   (2)   To guide the future development and renewal of the town in accordance
with the Comprehensive Plan and related policies;
   (3)   To provide for the safety, comfort and soundness of the built
environment and related open spaces;
   (4)   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability and
orderliness of all development through reasonable design standards; and
   (5)   To guide public and private policy and action to provide adequate and
efficient public and private facilities, the most aesthetically pleasing and
beneficial interrelationship between land uses, conserve natural resources such
as natural beauty, woodlands, open spaces and energy both during and after
development.
1-4 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (1)   This ordinance, which was enacted pursuant to state home rule and
planning enabling legislation (I.C. 36-1-3-4 and 36-7-4-700 series, as amended)
authorizes the Town Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove plats
for subdivision throughout the town and its jurisdictions area listed in Zoning
Ordinance which show lots, blocks or sites with or without new streets or
highways. This authority extends to the development or resubdivision of
undeveloped portions of already recorded plats.
   (2)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with the
regulations contained herein and in conformity with construction standards
adopted by the town.
1-5 ENACTMENT.
   In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, these subdivision regulations are hereby adopted.
1-6 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (1)   Interpretation and application. In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   (2)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (a)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
      (b)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations or the determinations of the
Commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and
such private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or
determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to these regulations and determinations made thereunder. (Note:
private provisions can only be enforced privately unless a public agency has
been made party to such agreements.)
   (3)   Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The town hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any
such part, provision or application.
1-7 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under or by virtue of prior existing subdivision regulations or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation or as
waiving any right of the town under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm or corporation by lawful action of the town except
as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
1-8 REPEALER.
   Upon the adoption of the Town of Bunker Hill Subdivision Ordinance according
to law, all subdivision ordinances as amended are hereby repealed, except for
such sections expressly retained herein.
1-9 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety and general
welfare, the town, on recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time
amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. Public hearings
on all proposed amendments shall be held by the Commission and/or the town in
the manner prescribed by law.
1-10 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to the town. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement and restrictive use of the land in order to conform to the physical
and economical development of the town and to the safety and general welfare of
the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the town at large.
1-11 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (1)   Procedure for resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map or area reserved thereon for public use or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the
Commission by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (2)   Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
1-12 VACATION OF PLATS.
   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-3-10 or 36-7-4-711.
1-13 VARIANCES.
   (1)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by
an alternative proposal, it may approve a variance to these subdivision
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations; and, further provided, the
Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (a)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (b)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (c)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and
      (d)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan or Official Map as interpreted by the
Commission.
   (2)   Conditions. In approving variances the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   (3)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
1-14 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.

regulations and to bring any violations or lack of compliance to the attention

proposed subdivision shall transfer or sell any such parcel before a plat of

governing the area. The filing and recording of the plat is without legal
effect unless approved by the Commission.

to comply with the provisions of this ordinance. If the Commission is
successful in its suit, the respondent shall pay the Commission’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees and all costs related to the enforcement of this ordinance.

hours to inspect or abate the appropriate action of any violation which has
occurred or may occur that is not in according with this ordinance.
      (e)   The Administrator may impose a stay of work on any property that is
found to be in violation of the subdivision ordinance. Proceedings and work on

3-1 GENERAL PROCEDURES.
   (1)   Discussion of requirements redesign conference. Prior to submitting
any of the materials required by this ordinance, the applicant or his or her
representative should discuss with the Administrator the nature of the land
division being proposed so that the applicant may be instructed concerning the
classification of his or her subdivision and what regulatory procedures apply
to it and must be followed under this ordinance in order to secure primary and
secondary approval. Where applicable, requirements concerning the general
layout of streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, drainage,
sewerage, fire protection and similar matters, as well as the availability of
existing services should be discussed. The Administrator shall also advise the
applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those
other officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision
plat coming within their jurisdiction. The distinction between major and minor
subdivisions and exempt divisions as defined in this ordinance, shall be made
by the Administrator when the applicant submits an application for sketch plan
approval in the case of major and minor subdivisions or, in the case of exempt
division, provides the Administrator at a redesign conference with adequate
information to enable him or her to determine that the proposed division is an
exempt division.
   (2)   Classification of land divisions. All land to be divided shall be
categorized into one of three main classes of land division indicated in this
ordinance’s definition of subdivision. These classes are:
      (a)   Major subdivisions;
      (b)   Minor subdivisions; and
      (c)   Exempt divisions.
Exempt divisions are not subject to the requirements of this ordinance beyond
the determination by the Administrator that they meet all the requirements for
exempt divisions set forth in §
3.5 herein. However, lots created by Exempt I Divisions (except Exemption F)
shall be ten or more acres in size to be eligible as principal use building
sites (Exemption A in the definition of subdivision), unless such lots have
been created by order of a court (Exemption C). No building site for principle
use created through Exemption A shall be reduced below ten acres unless through
subdivision or by order of a court (Exemption C). For purposes of this
paragraph, a lot is “created” on the date of its recording (see § 2 for the
definition of a principal use building). Before any permit shall be granted for
a structure to be erected on land to be subdivided into a major or minor
subdivision, the subdividing owner or his or her subdivision agent shall apply
for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with §
3.2 and either §§
3.3 or
3.4 of this ordinance as appropriate. Before any permit shall be granted for a
structure to be erected on a parcel of land to be created or altered by an
exempt division, the land divider or his or her agent shall certify to the
satisfaction of the Administrator that all requirements for exemption have been
met, as detailed in §
3.5 of this ordinance, in order to exempt the land division from all other
requirements of this ordinance.

the detailed plans and specifications thereof for approval.
      (b)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer these
plans to the appropriate agencies of the affected participating jurisdictions
for review. Once these agencies indicate their approval of the construction
plans or 14 working days have elapsed since their distribution without a
written response, the Administrator shall stamp the plans approved and return
one set to the applicant. In no event shall secondary approval (of the final
plat) be given prior to approval of the construction plans.
      (c)   Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements
shall be inspected by the appropriate participating jurisdiction. Such
inspections are required in all instances regardless of whether the work is
performed before or after secondary approval. Failure to request or to procure
inspection of work performed after the date of this ordinance and before
secondary approval may be cause for denial of secondary approval.
   (6)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (a)   Submission requirements. Following primary approval or conditional
primary approval of the preliminary plat and approval of the construction
plans, the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision,
shall file with the Administrator a request for secondary approval of a final
plat. The application shall:
         (i)   Be submitted on forms available at the office of the Commission;
         (ii)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof which
derives access from an existing state, county or municipal roadway;
         (iii)   Be accompanied by three copies of the final plat as described
in this ordinance;
         (iv)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of primary approval;
         (v)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission upon recommendation of the participating jurisdiction and shall
guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public
improvements; and
         (vi)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Commission, where they have been proposed by the subdivider or required
by the Commission.
      (b)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final plat shall either be found to be in conformance with the
primary approval by the Administrator or by the Commission at a public hearing.
If the final subdivision plat deviates from the preliminary plat that received
primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the Commission at a
public meeting for a new primary approval. The subdivider submitting a final
plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to whether this review
is to be performed by the Administrator, or by the Commission at a public
meeting.
         (i)   Should the subdivider not choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall within ten working days, review the items submitted as per
§
3.3(6)(a) in order to ascertain the sufficiency as to conformance with the
primary approval. If the submission is found to be in conformance and complete,
the Administrator shall recommend the signing of the certificate granting
secondary approval.
         (ii)   Should the subdivider choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall determine conformance with the primary approval at a public
hearing. The subdivider shall request Commission review in writing no less than
30 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which he or she
intends to have his or her final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the
matter on its next regular meeting agenda. The Administrator shall review the
proposal and submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and
the applicant; and at the public hearing, the Commission shall approve or
disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval it shall be signed by
the designated officials. If not granted secondary approval, then the
subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his or her submittal.
      (c)   Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a
major subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into
two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the
sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the
plat. The Commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as
will be commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and
may defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the
remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections must
contain at least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in the
approved plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections not
filed with the Administrator shall automatically expire after five years from
the date of primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the expiration
date has been extended.
   (7)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (a)   Signing of plat.
         (i)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
designated officials of the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate only after the bond and the construction plans have
been approved and all the conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied.
         (ii)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans submitted (as
required by §
5.1(2)(e)) and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
5.3(2)). There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities
have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the appropriate Board of Works,
County Commissioners, Town Council and/or the County Drainage Board that the
necessary improvements have been accomplished.
      (b)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (c)   Recording of final plat.
         (i)   The designated officials shall sign the certificate which shall
be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of the subdivision plat,
plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The Mylar prints shall be
returned within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to
file the plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of
this ordinance.
3-4 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (1)   General procedures for primary approval. Should the Administrator,
upon examination of the sketch plan application, classify the proposed land
division as a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and
be subject to the process outlined in §
6-6 and detailed in this section. In addition to a sketch plan which is
reviewed by the Administrator and checkpoint agencies for primary approval by
the Commission, the applicant seeking approval of a minor subdivision shall
submit for secondary approval a final subdivision plat which must be found in
compliance with the sketch plan or otherwise approved by the Commission in
order to be signed and recorded.
   (2)   Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application
for sketch plan approval shall be submitted no less than 30 calendar days prior
to either a regularly scheduled public meeting of the Commission at which the
proposal is intended to be acted upon. The Administrator shall place such
application on the agenda of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the
Commission to occur within 30 days after the date on which a complete
application is submitted.
   (3)   Sketch plan review process. Within 15 calendar days of the
subdivider’s sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and
possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this
ordinance. The Administrator shall request that a representative of each
checkpoint agency that wishes to be involved in a sketch plan review be present
to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration
the requirements of this ordinance, particular attention shall be given to
sewage disposal, drainage, lot size and arrangement, the further development of
adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided and the requirements of the Official Map or
Thoroughfare Plan and Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the participating
jurisdictions.
   (4)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda and prior
to the date of public hearing, the Administrator and other appropriate members
of the Commission’s staff shall review the proposal and prepare a written
report to the Commission and applicant indicating a recommendation with regard
to the subdivision being proposed.
   (5)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the sketch plan and notice of such
hearing shall be in the local newspaper of general circulation ten days prior
to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1) at the applicant’s expense. At the time of the
public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the
applicant has placed posters provided by the Administrator (advising interested
parties of the hearing) at the locations designated by him or her on the
proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing.
Interested parties shall be notified by the Commission of the date, time, place
and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in
advance of the hearing by mail.
   (6)   Primary approval of the sketch plan. After the Commission has, at a
regularly scheduled hearing, examined the sketch plan, Administrator’s report,
checkpoint recommendations, testimony and exhibits submitted, the Commission
shall, at a regularly scheduled hearing, approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove the sketch plan. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to
the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval or disapproval
and the reasons therefore accompanying the sketch plan within five days after
the public hearing. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to review by
certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until the minimum
of ten days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval or conditional
approval or conditional primary approval.
   (7)   Final subdivision plat procedure for secondary approval.
      (a)   Application requirements. Following approval or conditional
approval of the sketch plan, the applicant, if his or her wishes to proceed
with the subdivision, shall file with the Administrator an application for
secondary approval of a subdivision plat. The Application shall:
         (i)   Be submitted on forms available at the office of the Commission;
         (ii)   Include the entire subdivision or section thereof;
         (iii)   Be accompanied by three copies of the final subdivision plat
as described in this ordinance;
         (iv)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of approval;
         (v)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission upon recommendation of the participating jurisdiction and shall
guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public
improvements; and
         (vi)   Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by
the Commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the Commission.
      (b)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final subdivision plat shall either be found to be in conformance
with the approved sketch plan be the Administrator or by the Commission at a
public hearing. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the sketch plan
that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the
Commission at a public hearing for a new primary approval. The subdivider
submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to
whether this review is performed by the Administrator or by the Commission at a
public hearing.
         (i)    Should the subdivider not choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall within ten working days review the items submitted as per §
3.4(7)(a) in order to ascertain conformance with the primary approval. If the
submission is found to be in conformance and complete, the Administrator shall
recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary approval.
         (ii)   Should the subdivider choose Commission review, the Commission
shall determine conformance with primary approval at a public hearing. The
subdivider shall request in writing Commission review no less than 30 calendar
days prior to the date of the public hearing at which he or she intends to have
his or her final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the matter on its
next regular hearing agenda. The Administrator shall review the proposal and
submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and the
applicant; and at public hearing, the Commission shall give secondary approval
or disapproval of the final plat. If approved, it shall be signed by the
designated officers of the Commission. If not approved, the subdivider shall be
informed as to the insufficiency of his or her submittal.
      (c)   Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a
minor subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into
two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the
sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the
plat. The Commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as
is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may
defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the
remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing.
   (9)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (a)   Signing a plat.
         (i)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
designated officials of the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after the bond and the construction plans have been
approved and all the conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied.
         (ii)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), “as built” construction plans submitted (as
required by §
5.1(2)(e)) and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
5.3(2)). There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities
have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating jurisdiction,
as shown by a certificate signed by the Administrator, and that the necessary
improvements have been accomplished.
      (b)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (c)   Recording of plat.
         (i)   The designated officials shall sign the certificate granting se
secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible
Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat.
The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his or her engineer of
surveyor.
         (ii)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the
presence of the Administrator or his or her designee to file the plat with the
County Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the
subdivider to file the plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute
a violation of this ordinance.
3-5 EXEMPT DIVISIONS.
   (1)   General procedure for Exempt I Divisions. In order for a land division
to be considered an Exempt I Division, the information prescribed for the
applicable type of division under §
6.5 shall be submitted to the Administrator so that he or she can determine
whether the division meets the provisions of the definition and §
3.1 for this classification and therefore can issue to the subdivider a
statement of compliance to the applicable provisions of this ordinance. Both
the subdivider and the Administrator shall hold copies of the statement of
compliance. When the parcel so exempted by this statement is conveyed to
another party the copy of the instrument of such conveyance shall be recorded
with the County Recorder bearing a stamp of approval signed by the
Administrator indicating that such statement of compliance has been obtained as
ascertained by the copy(s) of the statement which have been held for this
purpose.
   (2)   General procedure for Exempt II Divisions. In order for a land
division to be considered an Exempt II Division and thus be exempted from all
other provisions of this ordinance except the definitional requirements in §
2.2 under Subdivisions, the requirements of §
3.1 and the informational requirements of §
6.6, certain conditions shall be met and certified to the appropriate agency by
the Administrator after his or her determination of qualification for this
status has been made (see discussion of requirements, §
3.1(3) necessary conditions for Exempt II Divisions). In addition to
definitional requirements and §
3.1, a land division qualifying as an Exempt II Division shall be shown as
meeting the following conditions.
      (a)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division does not have
sanitary sewer service available to it, that tract shall contain within its
boundaries sufficient soil of a kind defined by the State Board of Health
Bulletin HSE13 (1988) or its successor to allow for the proper installation of
an on-site sewage disposal system.
      (b)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division has frontage on a
public road, the land divider shall dedicate to the public real property of a
width sufficient to meet one-half of the required right-of-way width for that
specific public road as indicated on the Town Thoroughfare Plan or the Official
Map and of a length along that public road equal to the length of that parcel
along that roadway.
      (c)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division has frontage on a
public road, the depth of that parcel shall not be greater than twice the
length of that frontage, such depth being measured from the front lot line to
the rear lot line of the parcel.
      (d)   If a parcel created by such an exempt division requires a private
roadway because such parcel lacks frontage on a public road, such roadway shall
either be fully constructed in accordance with the following minimum standards
prior to the issuance of a building permit or be adequately assured to the
permit issuer’s satisfaction that it will be constructed to the following
minimum standards:
         (i)   Minimum depth of 16 feet; and
         (ii)   Minimum depth of eight inches of Type P or O made stone or
gravel. Such private roadway need only provide access as far as the parcel’s
property line and is not intended to include any individual drive within the
parcel.
      (e)   Certification of Exempt II Divisions. As the conditions in §
3.2(2) apply, the land divider shall provide to the Administrator:
         (i)   Written evidence that the County Board of Health has been
satisfied by a duly authorized representative of a qualified soil testing
service as to the presence within the parcel of sufficient soil of a kind
defined by the State Board of Health Bulletin HSE13 (1988) or its successor to
allow for the proper installation of an on-site septic sewage disposal system;
         (ii)   Official documentation indicating the dedication of right-of-
way to the appropriate jurisdiction;
         (iii)   A metes and bounds description of the parcel being created
indicating that its depth is no more than twice the frontage; and
         (iv)   A notarized affidavit assuring construction of a private
roadway to the standards previously indicated, prior to the issuance of a
building permit for that parcel.
      (f)   Exempt division review process. Within three working days of the
land divider’s complete submission of the required information in the case of
Exempt I Divisions (§
6.5) or the required information and certification (§
3.5(e) above) in the case of Exempt II Divisions, the Administrator shall
review the submission and notify the land divider that his or her proposed land
division either qualifies as an exempt division and is thus exempt from all
other provisions of this ordinance, or does not qualify as an exempt division
and is thus subject to the relevant subdivision processes described in this
ordinance.
      (g)   Dissolution.
         (i)   A recorded Exempt II Division or portion thereof may be
dissolved by the property owner or owners if, in doing so, no provision of this
or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute or provision of law is
violated. To do so, ten copies of a statement dissolving the Exempt II Division
(or any part of it) shall be submitted to the Administrator for review of
compliance with above-stated ordinances, rules and the like. This statement,
signed by all legal owners, contract buyers and optionees of the property and
notarized, shall contain the Exempt II Division number assigned by the
Administrator and legal descriptions of the parcels involved.
         (ii)   Upon a finding of compliance, the Administrator or his or her
designee shall sign all ten statements. Once signed, the approved dissolution
is eligible to be recorded.
         (iii)   It shall be the responsibility of the land divider in the
presence of the Administrator or his or her designee to file the approved
dissolution with the County Auditor and Recorder within 30 days of signature.
Failure of the land divider to so file and record shall automatically
invalidate the approval, rendering it null and void and requiring a complete
resubmittal for approval.
         (iv)   Upon recording the dissolution statement, the landowner is once
more eligible to pursue the full Exempt II Division process as per this
subsection. That is, the land involved, for purposes of land diversion, is
restored to its pre-exempt II Division status.
Section IV
4-1 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (1)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules and regulations:
      (a)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (b)   The Town Zoning Ordinance, Building and Housing Codes and all other
applicable laws and ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions;
      (c)   The Comprehensive Plan, Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan, Public
Utilities Plan and Capital Improvements Program of the town, including all
streets, drainage systems and parks shorn on the Official Map or Comprehensive
Plan as adopted;
      (d)   Section 4.5 deals with the provision of adequate potable water for
human consumption and adequate water for fire protection. Ensuring good water
supplies requires coordination between the area’s water suppliers, Health
Department and Fire Department together with such interested state agencies as
the State Board of Health and the State Department of Natural Resources. The
location of wells, where permitted, must take into consideration water quality
and quantity vis-a-vis water levels and draw-down and the possibility of water
contamination by sewage effluents from septic tank drain fields, polluted
streams and other sources. Sanitary sewerage and sewage treatment facilities (§
4.6 ) must be adequate to prevent water pollution and other health problems.
Requiring separate storm and wastewater sewerage systems is important for long-
run water pollution prevention even if the rest of the urbanized area still has
combined sewers because, in all probability, the regulations and any rules of
the Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies;
      (e)   The rules and regulations of the State Department of Highways if
the subdivision or any lot contained therein abut a state highway or state
frontage road;
      (f)   The highway and drainage standards and regulations adopted by the
County Engineer and all boards, commissions, agencies and officials of the
county; and
      (g)   All pertinent standards contained within still valid planning
guides published by the Plan Commission.
   (2)   Conformance required. Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision
is not in conformity with the above guides and requirements or with the
policies and purposes of these regulations established in §
1.4 of this ordinance.
   (3)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat or the Commission may require
that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in a form to be
approved by the Commission Attorney.
   (4)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another jurisdiction the Commission may
request assurance from the County Attorney that such access is legally
established and from the County Engineer that the access road is adequately
improved or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in
the amount to assure the construction of the access road. Lot lines shall be
laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   (5)   Boundary improvements.
      (a)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches
in diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each
corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following
grading of each phase of the subdivision.
      (b)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, three-fourths of an inch in
diameter by 30 inches in length at the corners of each lot. They shall be set
prior to the issuance of any building permit.
   (6)   Character of the land. Land which the Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements or other features which might reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Commission, upon recommendation of the County Engineer, to
solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall
be set aside for such uses permitted by the Zoning Ordinance as shall not
involve any such danger.
   (7)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Commission shall have
final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which shall be
determined at the time of primary approval.
4-2 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (1)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
   (2)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
in the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve all such potential lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to the street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in Zoning Ordinance.
   (3)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (a)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivided
lots.
      (b)   Access from primary and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in
general derive access from a primary or secondary arterial street. Where
driveway access for several adjoining lots, the Commission may require that
such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards from multiple access to such streets. Where possible, driveways
should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into
traffic on primary or secondary arterials.
   (4)   Soil preservation, grading and seeding.
      (a)   Final grading. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots
or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six
inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs and shall be stabilized by
seeding or planting.
      (b)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general stormwater drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of stormwater on any one or
more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the lot owner
to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for in the
approved construction plans.
      (c)   Lawn-grass seed and sod. All lots shall be seeded from the road
side edge of the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the
principal residence on the lot. The applicant shall submit an agreement in
writing signed by the developer and the property owner, with a copy to the
Building Permit Official, that respreading of soil and seeding of the lawn will
be done during the immediately following planting season.
   (5)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish or other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within
a subdivision, nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (6)   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards
established in the Zoning Ordinance and shall be noted as to height and
material on the final plat. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
said fence improvements have been duly installed.
   (7)   Water bodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the
entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Commission may approve an alternative allocation of interests whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so
placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No part of
the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied
by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area
of a lot from the street from which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure, of a design approved by the
County Engineer.
   (8)   Performance bond to include lot improvement. The performance bond
shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained
in §
4.2 of these regulations, including, but not limited to, soil preservation,
final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and waste,
fencing and all other lot improvements required by the Commission. Whether or
not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the expiration of the
performance bond, the town may enforce the provisions of the bond where
compliance with the provisions of this section or any other applicable law,
ordinance or regulation has not occurred.
4-3 STREETS.
   (1)   General requirements.
      (a)   Frontage on improved streets. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an
existing street on the Official Map or, if there is not an Official Map, unless
such a street is:
         (i)   An existing state, county or township highway; or
         (ii)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds. Such street or highway
must be suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulation
specifications or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under
these regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these
regulations or as indicated on the Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever
the area to be subdivided is to use an existing street frontage, such street
shall be suitably improved as provided herein above.
   (2)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded an improved and
conform to the county construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the County Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to secondary
approval.
   (3)   Topography and arrangement.
      (a)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and sharp curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
      (b)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on
the Official Map or Thoroughfare Plan and/or Comprehensive Plan.
         (i)   Widths of streets and highways shall conform to the width
specified by the County Highway Superintendent, article 4, § 2 and thoroughfare
standards cross-section (§
6-6) are recommended specification.
         (ii)   All culs-de-sac shall terminate in a circular right-of-way with
a minimum diameter 100 feet and shall not exceed 600 feet in length.
         (iii)   Alleys shall be discouraged in Residential Districts but
should be included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading
and unloading or access purposes. Where alleys are platted, they shall be 14
feet in width.
      (c)   All arterials and collector streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches and shopping centers, to population densities; and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land uses.
      (d)   Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to the property.
      (e)   Rigid, rectangular “gridiron” street patterns are generally to be
avoided and the use of casually curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac or loop
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable lay-
out and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land, innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where they are likely
to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those using them (e.g.,
non-grid rectilinear, trapezoidal, polygonal or other geometric patterns).
      (f)   Proposed streets shall, where appropriate, be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless this is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the Plan
Commission such extension(s) is/are not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision under consideration with the
existing street layout or for the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts (see paragraph 11(a) below).
      (g)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
Street Design
A.   Street (and alley when provided) shall be completed to grades shown on
plans, profiles and cross-sections, provided by the subdivider and prepared by
a registered professional engineer and approved by the Commission.
B.   The street shall be graded, surfaced and improved to the dimensions
required by such plans, profiles and cross-sections, and the work shall be
performed in the manner prescribed in Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction and Maintenance (current issue) of the Department of
Transportation.
C.   The street pavement shall be of Portland cement concrete of a flexible
pavement of a width as shown in this ordinance and shall be constructed in
accordance with design characteristics at least equal to those given below.

D.   Prior to placing the street and alley surfaces, adequate subsurface
drainage for the street shall be provided by the subdivider. Subsurface
drainage pipe, when required, shall be coated corrugated pipe or similar type
not less than 12 inches in diameter approved by the Commission. Plans and
profiles as built shall be filed with the Commission.
   (4)   Block.
      (a)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial street, railroads and waterways.
      (b)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,600 feet nor be less than
400 feet in length. Blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be
less than 1,000 feet in length.
      (c)   In long blocks, the Commission may require the reservation of
easements through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks not less than ten feet wide,
may be required by the Commission through the center of blocks more than 800
feet long or at other appropriate locations and at the ends of the culs-de-sac
where deemed essential to provide for circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities.
Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be
determined to be suitable by the Commission for the intended use.
   (5)   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single-family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided, and
lots at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple-family residential areas, entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and
such entrances shall be widely spaced.
   (6)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
      (a)   The subdivision of the lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along
the rear property line of such lots;
      (b)   A series of culs-de-sac or loop streets entered from and designed
generally to be at right angles to an access street that is at some distance
from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their terminal
lots backing onto the arterial; and
      (c)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass street and having
access thereto at widely spaced suitable points).
   (7)   Street names. The sketch plan, as submitted, shall indicate names of
proposed streets. As part of his or her review, the Administrator shall refer
proposed street names to the local Postmaster for his or her comments regarding
duplication of names and possible confusion. After reviewing them the
Administrator shall inform the subdivider of his or her recommendations for
their possible revision during the sketch plan review. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the
county or other nearby areas so as to avoid confusion. A street which is, or is
planned as, a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name.
   (8)   Street regulatory signs. The applicant shall provide and install a
street sign at every street intersection within his or her subdivision as
required by the County Engineer. The county shall inspect and approve all
street signs before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on
the approved streets.
   (9)   Street lights. If installed, will be in accordance with the
specification set by the County Engineer.
   (10)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access to it from
adjacent property if such street is a local service street rather than a
collector or arterial street (see paragraphs (5) and (6) above).
   (11)   Construction of streets.
      (a)   Construction of streets other than culs-de-sac. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent
subdivisions or other properties when such continuation is necessary for the
convenient movements of traffic, for effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities and where such continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
be a dead-end (stub) street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be provided for
all such temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat
that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors
whenever the street is continued. Temporary turnarounds must be provided at the
ends of such stub streets. The Commission may limit the length of temporary
dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards in these regulations.
      (b)   Culs-de-sac (permanent dead-end streets). Where a street does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with county
construction standards and specifications available from the County Engineer’s
office. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be limited in length in accordance
with the design standards in these regulations.
   (12)   Design standards.
      (a)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access for police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and
street maintenance equipment and to coordinate street location in order to
achieve a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties,
the following design standards for streets are hereby required (street
classifications may be indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan
or on the Official Map; otherwise, they shall be determined by the Commission).
      (b)   Street surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the applicant may be required to
construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause the roadways to be
surfaced to the widths prescribed in these regulations. Said surfacing shall be
of such character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with
similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as
determined by the County Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for
culverts, drains and bridges. All street pavement, shoulders, drainage
improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to
all construction standards and specifications adopted by the Commission, County
Engineer or the county shall be incorporated into the construction plans
required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
      (c)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designed in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes.
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (d)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
         (i)   In Residential Districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: “This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
other than earth berms, walls, fences and other landscape screening devices
approved by the Commission is prohibited.”
         (ii)   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad
shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure a
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (iii)   Streets parallel to a railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (e)   Intersections.
         (i)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than
two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Commission.
         (ii)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has
separated, dual drives, without median breaks at either such intersection.
Where local streets intersect with arterials, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections of arterials shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (iii)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving
a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
         (iv)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
         (v)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% or less.
      (f)   Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the county. The sharing of expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the county and the
applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant pro-rata as the
percentage of his or her land developed and so served.
   (13)   Street dedications and reservations.
      (a)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision’s
boundaries.
      (b)   Widening and realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow street or when the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map,
Thoroughfare Plan or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment
or widening of a street that would require use of some of the land in the
subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate such
streets at his or her own expense. Such frontage streets and other streets on
which subdivision lots front shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant
at his or her own expense to the full width required by these subdivision
regulations. Land reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in
satisfying the yard or area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
4-4 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (1)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for stormwater or
floodwater runoff channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed as approved by the Commission and the County
Drainage Board, and a copy of the design computations shall be submitted along
with the plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried
across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in
the gutter or when the encroachment of stormwater into the street disrupts
traffic. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and catch
basins or inlets shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (2)   Nature of stormwater facilities.
      (a)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as result of, the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall
be located in the street right-of-way, where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed casements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in
accordance with the county’s construction standards and specifications.
      (b)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (i)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwater,
subject to the specifications of the County Engineer. However, in such
subdivisions containing lots of less than 15,000 square feet in areas and in
business and industrial districts, underground storm sewers systems shall be
constructed throughout the subdivision and be conducted to an approved outfall.
Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the County Engineer.
         (ii)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the County Engineer (see comment above) and the
Commission, the developer shall make arrangements for future stormwater
disposal by the public utility system at the time the plat received final
approval. Cost provision(s) for such connection(s) shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the amount of the performance bond or equivalent required for the
subdivision plat.
      (c)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The County Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the required construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (d)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The County Engineer (see
comment under subsection (b)(i) above) shall determine the effect of each
proposed subdivision on existing drainage facilities outside the area of the
subdivision. County drainage studies together with such other studies as may be
available and appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where
it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the
Commission may withhold secondary approval of the subdivision until provision
(such as a storage facility) has been made for the improvement of said
potential condition in such sum as the Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage from it will be provided
to an adequate drainage water course or facility.
      (e)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the floodplain but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above ponding levels.
      (f)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab-type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (g)   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
floodplain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in the county by
filling or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission
in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
      (h)   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an
area of the floodplain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may
approve such subdivision provided, that: all streets are elevated sufficiently
to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for residential usage have
a flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by, floodwater; and approval to fill the area from the
Natural Resources Commission has been obtained in writing. Lands below the
regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement
for any lot.
      (i)   Floodplain areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of
the floodplain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not
been made, the Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all
streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all
lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by floodwater; and
filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory flood
elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream. All
filling in the floodplain must be approved in writing by the State Natural
Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be
used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (j)   Recording of plats in the floodplain and floodway fringe. All final
plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that of the
regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the regulatory flood boundary
and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final plat for
recording.
   (3)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (a)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage course, drainage way, channel or stream, a stormwater easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided, granted or dedicated to the county
conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width
and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose of both drainage
and maintenance of the right-of-way. Wherever possible it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate
width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (b)   Drainage easements.
         (i)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the right-of-way lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         (ii)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation, easement land on both sides of existing watercourses of a width
to be determined by the Commission and in the case of legal drains, the County
Drainage Board.
         (iii)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across
private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be
secured and indicated on the plat.
         (iv)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be included in
the computations for determining the number of lots allowable under average
density procedures nor for computing the area requirement for any individual
lot.
4-5 WATER FACILITIES.
   (1)   General requirements.
      (a)   The applicant shall take all actions necessary to extend or create
a water-supply district for the purpose of providing a water-supply system
capable of providing for domestic water use and fire protection.
      (b)   Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) conforming to the
requirements and specifications of the state or local authorities. All water
mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
      (c)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the officially
designated agency of the state, county or municipality concerned.
      (d)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, water
supply improvements and the boundary lines of proposed districts indicating all
improvements proposed to be served shall be shown on the preliminary plat, and
the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
      (e)   The design of all water facilities shall conform to or exceed the
standards described by the County Board of Health and the State Board of
Health.
   (2)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (a)   In low-density zoning districts, if a public water system is not
available, at the discretion of the Commission, individual wells may be used or
a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate supply of
potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision. Water sample
test results shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. These approvals shall be submitted to the Commission.
      (b)   If the Commission requires that a connection to a public water main
be eventually provided as a condition for approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives secondary approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to ensure compliance.
   (3)   Fire hydrants. Hydrants should be provided at each street intersection
and at intermediate points between intersections as recommended by the State
Insurance Services Office and the local Fire Department. Generally, hydrant
spacing may range from 350 to 600 feet depending on the nature of the area
being served as determined by the County Engineer.
4-6 SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
   (1)   General requirements. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the county construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations and standards of the County Engineer, Health Department and other
appropriate state and federal agencies. In the case of a county system extended
into the county, the county’s engineering standards and the like would prevail.
   (2)   Sanitary sewerage system requirements. Where provided, sanitary
sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems and
shall be installed to serve each lot to grades and sizes required by approving
officials and agencies. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including the
installation of laterals in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations and guidelines of the Health Officer,
participating jurisdiction and appropriate state agency.
   (3)   Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities
are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot
areas shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and any
ordinance of any participating jurisdiction (where applicable) establishing lot
area for individual sewerage disposal systems.
   (4)   Selected design criteria.
      (a)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with a straight alignment
between manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the County Engineer.
      (b)   Manhole location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each
line and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 18 inches in
diameter and larger.
      (c)   Manholes. The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer
and the manhole invert shall not exceed 12 inches where required to match
crowns. The use of drop manholes requires approval by the County Engineer. The
minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall conform to those specified by the
County Engineer. Inside drop manholes will require special consideration;
however, in no case shall the minimum clear distance be less than that
indicated herein. The relationships between intersecting sewer lines shall meet
the standards required by the County Engineer (see (a) above).
      (d)   Sewerage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street
or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes. Where
sewer lines in private easements cross public street or alley right-of-way, a
manhole shall be provided in such rights-of-way where possible. Imposed loading
shall be provided over the top of pipe in street and alley rights-of-way or
three feet in all other areas.
      (e)   Cleanouts. Cleanouts will not be permitted.
      (f)   Water supply interconnections. There shall be no physical
connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer
which will permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable
water system. Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other
water supply sources and structures.
      (g)   Relation of sewers to water mains. A minimum horizontal distance of
ten feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer lines. At points
where sewers cross water mains, the sewer shall be constructed of cast iron
pipe or encased in concrete for a distance often feet in each direction from
the crossing, measured perpendicular to the water line. This will not be
required when the water line is at least two feet above the sewer line.
4-7 SIDEWALKS.
   (1)   Required improvements.
      (a)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated, unpaved portions
of the rights-of-way of all streets.
      (b)   Concrete curbs are required for all streets where sidewalks are
required by these regulations or required at the discretion of the Commission.
      (c)   A grassed or landscaped median strip at least two feet wide shall
separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs. The median strip shall be improved
according to §
4.2(4) of these regulations.
   (2)   Pedestrian accesses. In order to facilitate pedestrian access from the
street to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby streets, the Commission
may require perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. Such
easements shall be indicated on both the preliminary and final plats.
4-8 UTILITIES.
   (1)   Location. All utility lines, including, but not limited to, gas,
electric power, telephone and CATV cables may be required to be located
underground throughout the subdivision. All utility lines and other facilities
existing and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the
preliminary plat or sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision. Underground
service connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be
installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the Commission, the
requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in the case of
adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership intended to be developed for
the same primary use.
   (2)   Easements.
      (a)   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for
utilities (private and municipal). Such easements shall be at least ten feet
wide. Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the
applicable utility companies for the coordination of utility easements with
those established in adjoining properties.
      (b)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided alongside
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. All easements
shall be indicated on preliminary and final plats.
4-9 PUBLIC USES.
   (1)   Parks, playground and recreation areas.
      (a)   Recreation standards. The Commission may require that land be
reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreational purposes in locations
designated on the Comprehensive Plan or otherwise where such reservations would
be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography and general character and shall have adequate road access for the
particular purposes envisioned by the Commission. The area shall be shown and
marked on the plat: “Reserved for Park and/or Recreational Purposes.” When
recreation areas are required, the Commission shall determine the number of
acres to be reserved from the following table, which has been prepared on the
basis of providing three acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling units.
The Commission may refer such proposed reservations to the local government
official or agency in charge of parks and recreation for recommendation. If
approved by such official or agency, the developer shall dedicate all such
recreation areas to the local government as a condition of secondary approval.
      (b)   Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a character and location suitable for use as playground, play field or other
active recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry. It shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Commission, and the
cost of the improvements shall be included in the amount of the performance
bond. The Commission may refer any subdivision intended to contain a dedicated
park to the local government official, department or agency in charge of parks
and recreation for a recommendation. All land to be reserved for dedication to
the town or county for park purposes shall have prior approval of the town or
county and shall be shown on the plat as “Reserved for Park and/or Recreation
Purposes.”
      (c)   Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the preceding subsections of this ordinance shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation
purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
4-10 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (1)   General. Existing features which would add value to the type of
intended development or to the county as a whole, such as trees, watercourses
falls, beaches, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
subdivision nor any change of grade of the land affected until primary approval
of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat which are
required to be retained shall be preserved and all trees, where needed, shall
be welled and protected against change of grade. The sketch plan shall show the
number and location of existing trees, as required by these regulations and
shall further indicate all those marked for retention and the location of all
proposed shade trees required along the street side(s) of each lot as required
by these regulations.
4-11 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (1)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall meet such special provisions as the Commission finds
appropriate and requires. A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to
all the requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Planning Commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be
subject to all the requirements of these regulations as well as such additional
standards required by the Commission and shall conform to the proposed land use
and standards established in the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map and Zoning
Ordinance, except that where lot lines are to be established incrementally they
need not be shown on the sketch plan or the preliminary plat for primary
approval. All shopping centers and other nonresidential subdivisions of
buildings for leasehold shall be subject to the relevant provisions of this
ordinance.
   (2)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
street, parcel and block pattern proposed are appropriate for the uses
anticipated and adequately take into account other uses in the vicinity. The
following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (a)   Proposed commercial or industrial parcels shall be suitable in
minimum area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Proposals for incremental lot by lot subdivision must be made clear in a
statement on the preliminary plat which is satisfactory to the Commission.
      (b)   Street rights-of-way and pavement construction shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated
thereupon.
      (c)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission upon
recommendation of the county with respect to street, curb, gutter and sidewalk
design and construction.
      (d)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission with respect
to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and stormwater
drainage and preprocessing of sewage. Special requirements may also be imposed
regarding the storage and disposal of toxic materials.
      (e)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing onto existing or
potential residential development and provision of a permanently landscaped
buffer strip where necessary.
      (f)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
Section V
5-1 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (1)   Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
designated officials, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the Town
Engineer all the streets, sanitary and other public improvements, including lot
improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in this
ordinance, specified in the approved construction plans and on the final
subdivision plat and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate the public
improvements to the town, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the
property and public improvements thus dedicated.
   (2)   Performance bond.
      (a)   The Commission, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirement
that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of
the final subdivision plat or section thereof and that in lieu thereof, the
applicant shall post bond securable to the Town of Bunker Hill, hereinafter
referred to as performance bond, in an amount equivalent to 100% of the
estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements. This amount
of bond shall be sufficient to secure to the participating jurisdiction the
satisfactory construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of
required public improvements, as provided for in §§
3.3(7)(a)(i) and
3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance.
      (b)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the Town of Bunker Hill in an amount equivalent to 100% of the
estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public
improvements as provided for in §§
3.3(7)(a)(i) and
3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. Any such check shall be held by the Town Clerk-
Treasurer.
      (c)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit in behalf of the subdivider and securable by the town in an
amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided in §§
3.3(7)(a)(i) and
3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is
used, it shall be written for a maximum length of two years. The Commission,
two months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall determine if
the public improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the town or other
units of government having jurisdiction over them and if they have not been
accepted, shall so notify the subdivider of the town’s intent to secure the
funds pledged by such letter of credit or at the discretion of the Commission,
to grant an extension of the original period fixed by the Commission. No
extension shall exceed one year, and the subdivider shall file with the
Commission a new letter of credit for the period so extended.
      (d)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to either the Town Clerk-Treasurer and the subdivider to be
held by the Town Clerk-Treasurer in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in §§
3.3(7)(a)(i) and
3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. The subdivider must endorse the certificate of
deposit before submitting it to the Commission so that the town may secure the
funds.
      (e)   A performance bond furnished pursuant to this ordinance shall
comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the
Commission Attorney as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution as set
forth in this ordinance. The period within which required public improvements
must be completed shall be specified by the Commission in the primary approval
of the preliminary plat and shall be incorporated into the bond and shall not
in any event exceed two years from date of secondary approval. Such bond shall
be approved by the participating jurisdiction as to amount. The Commission may,
upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth
in such bond for a maximum period of one year, provided that the bond submitted
for this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission
may, at any time during the term of such bond, accept a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond.
   (3)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Commission and shall
maintain same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction
of any temporary public facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with
the Commission as separate suitable bond for temporary facilities. This bond
shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained and removed (except for turnaround at ends of the peripheral stub
streets intended for connection into adjacent future subdivisions).
   (4)   Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his or her expense without reimbursement by the
participating jurisdiction or any public improvement district therein, unless
sharing of expenses is agreed upon by the town.
   (5)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions
apply may file a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this section in lieu of said bond.
   (6)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the
preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and the required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the participating
jurisdiction may thereupon request the town to declare the bond to be in
default and cause all public improvements to be installed according to
secondary approval regardless of the extent of the building development at the
time the bond is declared to be in default.
   (7)   Acceptance of dedication offers. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by
the town of any street, easement or park shown on said plat. The Commission may
require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The
approval relates only to the real property itself.
5-2 INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (1)   General procedure. If the participating jurisdiction finds upon
inspection per §
3.3(7)(a)(i) and
3.4(8)(a)(i) that any of the improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the approved construction plans, the applicant shall be
responsible for completing the public improvements according to such plans.
Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a performance bond, the
applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for
completing the public improvements according to specifications.
   (2)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (a)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The town (or other
participating jurisdiction) shall not accept required public improvements, nor
the Commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the town has
submitted to it a certificate stating that all required public improvements or
a pro rata part in the case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed.
The applicant’s engineer or surveyor shall provide the participating
jurisdiction with detailed “as built” construction plans of the public
improvements, indicating location, dimensions, materials and other information
required by the Commission or participating jurisdiction. Upon such
certification, the town shall thereafter accept the public improvements for
maintenance in accordance with the established procedures unless the town has
reliable information as to noncompliance with the plans and specifications.
      (b)   Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of public improvements, but only by the amount
originally estimated for the completion of said public improvements.
5-3 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (1)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements on
the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks (where required) until acceptance of said public improvements by the
town (or other participating jurisdiction).
   (2)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
Commission prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost of
all public improvements and in a form satisfactory to the Commission Attorney.
The maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required public improvements for a period of three years after the date of
their acceptance by the town.
5-4 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued for the last 10% of lots in a final
subdivision plat or section thereof, or if 10% be less than two, for the last
two lots of a subdivision or section thereof, until all public improvements
required by the Commission for the plat with the exception of sidewalks have
been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the participating
jurisdiction.
