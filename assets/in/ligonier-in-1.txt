§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the "Ligonier City
Code," for which designation "Code of Ordinances," "Codified Ordinances" or
"Code" may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.

feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
non-severability provision, each division or part of every section is
severable. If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a provision of this code stating that the provisions of
an ordinance are severable as provided in division (B) above does not affect
the operation of division (B) with respect to that ordinance.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered unless the subject matter is changed
or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day
be a Saturday, Sunday or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   (A)   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former
section or law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section
or law is not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any
section shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability
incurred under the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides.
   (B)   The section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the
purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of
the penalty, forfeiture or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
Statutory reference:
   Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and amending ordinances, if any, are listed
following the text of the code section. Example:

Operation and Maintenance Fund created as of the date of the advance refunding
of the refunded bonds. On the last day of each calendar month, revenues of the
sewage works shall thereafter be transferred from the Revenue Fund to the
Operation and Maintenance Fund so that the balance maintained in this Fund
shall be sufficient to pay the expenses of operation, repair and maintenance
for the then next succeeding two calendar months. The monies credited to this
Fund shall be used for the payment of the reasonable and proper operation,
repair and maintenance expenses of the sewage works on a day-to-day basis. Any
monies in the Fund may be transferred to the Sewage Works Sinking Fund if
necessary to prevent a default in the payment of principal of or interest on
the outstanding bonds of the sewage works.
(1998 Code, § 2-172)
   (I)   Sewage Works Sinking Fund. There is created a sinking fund for the
payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds which by their terms
are payable from tax increment and the net revenues of the sewage works and the
payment of any fiscal agency charges in connection with the payment of bonds,
which fund shall be designated the "Sewage Works Sinking Fund" (herein, "Sewage
Works Sinking Fund" or "Sinking Fund"). There shall be set aside and deposited
in the Sinking Fund, as available, and as hereinafter provided, a sufficient
amount of Tax Increment and, to the extent tax increment is not sufficient, the
net revenues of the sewage works to meet the requirements of the Bond and
Interest Account and Reserve Account created in the Sinking Fund. The payments
shall continue until the balances in the Bond and Interest Account and the
Reserve Account, equal the amount needed to redeem all of the then outstanding
bonds of the sewage works.
(1998 Code, § 2-173)
   (J)   Bond and Interest Account.
      (1)   Any monies heretofore accumulated to pay principal and interest on
the refunded bonds shall be credited to and become a part of the Trust Account
under the escrow agreement and used for the first payments made from the Trust
Account.
      (2)   On each June 30 and December 31 following the date of issuance of
the refunding bonds, there shall be transferred from the Allocation Fund and
credited to the Bond and Interest Account all tax increment, up to an amount
which will be sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the refunding
bonds due and payable within the next 13 calendar months and any bank fiscal
agency charges as they become payable.
      (3)   Beginning as of the date of issuance of the refunding bonds, there
shall be credited on the last day of each calendar month from the Revenue Fund
to the Bond and Interest Account an amount of the net revenues equal to at
least one-sixth of the principal of and at least one-sixth of the interest on
all then outstanding bonds payable during the next succeeding six-month period
minus the amount of tax increment on deposit in the Bond and Interest Account,
until the amount of interest and principal payable on the then next succeeding
interest and principal payment date shall have been so credited. There shall
similarly be credited to the account any amount necessary to pay the bank
fiscal agency charges for paying interest on outstanding bonds as the same
become payable. The city shall, from the sums deposited in the Sinking Fund and
credited to the Bond and Interest Account, remit promptly to the registered
owner or to the bank fiscal agency sufficient monies to pay the interest and
principal on the due dates thereof together with the amount of bank fiscal
agency charges.

the sewage works, Refunding Bond proceeds or a combination thereof shall be
deposited into the Reserve Account. The deposit into the Reserve Account shall
equal but not exceed the least of:
         (a)   Maximum annual debt service on the refunding bonds;
         (b)   One hundred twenty-five percent of average annual debt service
on the refunding bonds; or
         (c)   Ten percent of the proceeds of the refunding bonds (the "reserve
requirement").
      (2)   The balance in the Reserve Account shall be maintained to equal the
reserve requirement.
      (3)   The Reserve Account shall constitute the margin for safety and
protection against default in the payment of principal of and interest on the
refunding bonds, and the monies in the Reserve Account shall be used to pay
current principal and interest on the refunding bonds to the extent that monies
in the Bond and Interest Account are insufficient for that purpose. Any
deficiency in the balance maintained in the Reserve Account shall be made up
from the next available tax increment or net revenues remaining after credits
into the Bond and Interest Account. If monies in the Reserve Account are
transferred to the Bond and Interest Account to pay principal of and interest
on outstanding refunding bonds, then the depletion of the balance in the
Reserve Account shall be made up from the next available tax increment or net
revenues after the credits into the Bond and Interest Account. Any monies
(except monies attributable to tax increment or investment earnings on tax
increment which shall be transferred to the Bond and Interest Account) in the
Reserve Account in excess of the reserve requirement shall either be
transferred to the Sewage Works Improvement Fund or be used for the purchase of
outstanding bonds including accrued interest.

additions and extensions of the sewage works or for any other lawful purpose.
As of the date of the delivery of the refunding bonds, any other available and
unrestricted moneys of the sewage works not otherwise deposited pursuant to the
terms of this division (L) shall be transferred to the Improvement Fund. Monies
in the Sewage Works Improvement Fund shall be transferred to the Sewage Works
Sinking Fund if necessary to prevent a default in the payment of principal and
interest on the then outstanding bonds or, if necessary, to eliminate any
deficiencies in credits to or minimum balance in the Reserve Account of the
Sewage Works Sinking Fund or may be transferred to the Operation and
Maintenance Fund to meet unforeseen contingencies in the operation, repair and
maintenance of the sewage works.
      (2)   After meeting the requirements of the Bond and Interest Account and
the Reserve Account, any remaining tax increment shall be held in the
Allocation Fund by the Clerk-Treasurer and used for any purposes permitted by

FIXED ASSET INVENTORY AND CAPITALIZATION POLICY
§ 34.60 ESTABLISHED; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Established. There is hereby established a fixed asset capitalization
policy for the city which policy shall read and provide as follows.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CAPITAL ASSETS.
         (a)   Land, infrastructure, buildings, improvements other than
buildings, machinery and equipment, construction in progress. All land will be
capitalized but not depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than one
year, and having a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including
acquisitions by lease-purchase agreements or donated items). A capital asset
meeting the criteria will be reported and depreciated in the government-wide
financial statements.
         (b)   Assets that are not capitalized (items having a unit cost of
less than $5,000) are expensed in the year of acquisition. Exceptions are:
            1.   Items costing less than the above-described limits which are
permanently installed as a part of the cost of original construction or
installation of a larger building or equipment unit will be included in the
cost of the larger unit;
            2.   Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment
construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged to
capital assets even though the cost of individual items are less than such
limits; and
            3.   Cabinets, shelving bookcases, and similar items added
subsequent to original construction, which are custom-made for a specific place
and adaptable elsewhere will be capitalized.
         (c)   Note: purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant
requirements or the above procedures, whichever is most restrictive.
      CAPITAL OUTLAYS. Expenditures which benefit both the current and future
fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures,
construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other fixed assets;
infrastructure, machinery and equipment having an appreciable and calculable
period of usefulness. These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or
addition to the city’s general fixed assets. Accounting for costs of city-owned
land, infrastructures, buildings, machinery and equipment, as well as
construction in progress; acquiring land, and infrastructures as well as
installings or structures construction or improvement of buildings, adding
improvements other than buildings, other capital assets; and machinery and
equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness.
These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the
city’s capital assets. To meet the Indiana State Board of Accounts requirements
as of fixed asset reports for 2021 all items will have life expectancies
established with depreciated values on an annual basis with the exception of
land which is never depreciated. Documentation of costing sources: architects,
engineering firms, project managers, and construction companies, life
expectancy tables, cost indexes and other means for establishing known or
estimated historical costs will be provided.
      ENTERPRISE FUNDS. Those funds used to account for operations that:
         (a)   Are financed and operated in a manner similar to private
business enterprise where the intent of the City Council is that the costs
(expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the
general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through
user charges; or
         (b)   Where the City Council has decided that periodic determination
of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or income is appropriate for capital
maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other
purposes.
         (c)   The Enterprise Fund of the city shall include the municipally-
owned water and wastewater utilities. Operation of the utilities shall require
Enterprise Fund accounting and reporting.
      FIXED ASSETS. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the
operating of activities of the city and are relatively permanent and are needed
for the production and sale of goods or services are termed property, plant and
equipment or fixed assets.
      HISTORICAL COST. The cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or
services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings, equipment and most
inventories are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost
attribute.
      TANGIBLE ASSETS. Assets that can be observed by one or more of the
physical senses. These assets may be seen and touched and, in some
environments, heard and smelled.
(Ord. 829-2013, passed 2-11-2013; Ord. 988-2023, passed 4-24-2023)
§ 34.61 SPECIFIC CAPITALIZATION PROVISIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Land.
         (a)   LAND is defined as specified land, lots, parcels, or acreage.
The city will capitalize all land purchases, regardless of cost including

            2.   The useful life is extended by two or more years.
      (3)   Unless maintenance/repairs exceed $50,000 they will be considered

the date of transfer with any associated costs.
      (5)   Infrastructure purchases using federal, or state funding will
follow the above provisions.
   (B)   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT.
      (1)   The definition of MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. Examples include trucks,

have a known or estimated historical cost of $5,000 or greater.
      (2)   The city will capitalize items with an individual value equal to or
greater than $5,000. Machinery combined with other machinery to form one unit
with a total value greater than the above-mentioned limit will be one unit with

be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all of the following
conditions:
         (a)   Total costs exceed $5,000;
         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years;
         (c)   Capitalization of machinery and equipment costs will include
shipping charges, consultant fees and any other cost directly associated with
the purchase, delivery or set up, which makes such machinery or equipment
operable for its intended purpose. Cost of attachments for machinery and
equipment shall be included since they are necessary for using the asset for
its intended purpose.
         (d)   Repairs and maintenance will not be capitalized such as:
collisions, engine replacements, maintenance, and the like. They will be
charged even if they meet the threshold of $5,000 or greater.
         (e)   Salvage value of machinery or equipment will be determined on an
asset-by-asset basis.
Depreciation will be calculated at year-end.
      (3)   Buildings.
         (a)   A department will capitalize building as full cost with no
subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments. Examples of attachments are
roofs, heating, cooling, lighting or sprinkler systems, or any part of the
basic building. The department will include the cost of items designed or
purchased exclusively for the building.
         (b)   A department’s new building will be capitalized only if it meets
the following conditions:
            1.   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
            2.   The useful life is greater than two years.
         (c)   A department improving or renovating an existing building will

date of transfer with any associated costs.
   (D)   Improvements other than buildings. These assets are defined as
improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached or not easily removed, and
which will have a life expectancy of greater than two years. Examples are
sidewalks, parking areas and drives, golf cart paths, fencing, retaining walls,
pools, outside fountains, planters, and underground sprinkler systems. A
sidewalk down the road for public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement
and is not capitalized. However, sidewalks installed upon the city-owned land
for use by the public and for the support of the City facilities are capital
assets.
      (1)   Improvements or renovations to existing improvements other than
buildings will be capitalized only if the result meets the following
conditions:
         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000; and
         (b)   The useful life is greater than two years.

funding will follow provisions in divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) above.
   (E)   Recording and accounting. The city and its various departments shall
classify capital expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the
expenditure was made in accordance with the Chart of Accounts of the Cities and
City’s Accounting Manual. The cost of the property, plant and equipment
includes all expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready
for use. For the purpose of recording fixed assets of the city and its
departments, the valuation of assets shall be based on historical costs, or
where the historical cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in
existence.
   (F)   Construction work in progress capitalization provisions. Where
construction work has not been completed in the current calendar year, the cost
of the project shall be recorded as “construction work in progress.” When the
project is complete, the project will be recorded to the applicable capital
asset item type account and only if the capital asset meets the required
conditions.
   (G)   Life expectancy and depreciation methods.
      (1)   The city will indicate life expectancy for each asset and by using
a national table and our generally accepted life expectancy for specific items.
Depreciation of capital assets will be calculated using the straight-line
method. There will be no salvage value used. Depreciation will be calculated at
year-end. The asset current life year and ensuing depreciation shall begin the
year after the year purchased (example: the asset purchased in 2012; the 2013
current life and depreciation year is one). Land is not depreciated according
to general accepted accounting principles.
      (2)   Straight-line depreciation. All assets accounted for under the
capital asset policy will be depreciated using the straight-line method of
depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded. Following is a list
of the most city useful lives:
 
ASSET                             USEFUL LIFE (years)

shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint.
      (4)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.

service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in the sum of $20.

      (3)   Other contaminants or characteristics which, from their nature and
quantity, might be harmful to the structures, processes or operations of the
sewage works or to health, whether by themselves or through interacting with
other wastes in the public sewers.
   (B)   Pretreatment facilities. When, after making the above review, the
Superintendent concludes that, before the person discharges his or her wastes
into the public sewers, he or she must modify or eliminate those constituents
which would be harmful to the structures, processes or operations of the sewage
works or injurious to health, then the person shall either modify the wastes at
the point of origin or shall provide and operate at his or her own expense the
preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined to be
necessary to render those wastes acceptable for admission to the public sewers
and follow the procedures outlined in this chapter.
   (C)   Approval of pretreatment facilities. Plans, specifications and other
pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or processing
facilities shall be submitted to the city for examination and approval, and no
construction of these facilities shall begin until the city, through its Board
of Public Works and Safety, has given its written approval. This approval shall
not exempt the person from the obligation to make further reasonable
adaptations of the facilities when adaptations prove necessary to secure the
results desired. Plans, specifications and other pertinent information shall
also be submitted to the IDEM for approval in accordance with IDEM regulations.
   (D)   Operation of pretreatment facilities. When preliminary treatment
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory

of industrial wastes may be used to mutual agreement between the Superintendent
and the user provided they meet federal requirements as set forth in 40 C.F.R.
Part 136. The city may make, without charge to the user, the initial analysis
of the user's wastes as well as other initial tests the Superintendent may deem
advisable. Regular periodic check analyses and analyses made by the city at the
request of the user shall be charged to the user according to the standard work
order billing practice.
      (2)   All the analyses shall be binding in determining strength-of-wastes
surcharges and other matters dependent upon the character and concentration of
wastes.
   (J)   Representative analyses.
      (1)   Until an adequate analysis of a representative sample of a user's
wastes has been obtained, the city shall, for the purpose of this chapter, make
a determination of the character and concentration of the user's wastes by
using data based on analyses of similar processes or data for that type of
business that are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or
from industry-recognized authoritative sources.
      (2)   This method, if selected by the city, shall continue at the city's
pleasure or until an adequate analysis has been made.
   (K)   EPA review. All data collected pertaining to industrial wastes,
including records kept by each industrial user, shall be subject to audit and
review by the Environmental Protection Agency.

the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Superintendent of
the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
      (2)   Within five days following the discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. This notification shall not relieve the user from
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall this notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who call in the event of a
discharge described in division (F)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the

Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed;
who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of the analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.
   (N)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set forth
in this chapter or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to this
chapter shall submit to the Authority a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a constant basis, and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the discharger and certified by a qualified
engineer.

§ 59.120 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   (A)   Superintendent may order emergency suspension of a user's discharge.
The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal
notice to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to
present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
   (B)   Implementation of emergency suspension. Any user notified of a
suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent may take steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or the
endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   (C)   Responsibilities in the event of emergency suspension. A user that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future

or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Compliance order. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   (C)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all violations and
directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 59.123 CONSENT ORDERS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for non-compliance.
   (B)   The documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to
correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the document.
   (C)   These documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant of this code and shall be judicially
enforceable.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)

   (A)   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for the action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.
   (B)   The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user.
A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 59.125 JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Judicial action authorized. Following the entry of any order by the
Authority with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the
provisions of this chapter, the City Attorney, following the authorization of
the action by the Authority, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/
or equitable relief in the appropriate court.
   (B)   Injunctive relief. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the appropriate court through
the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this chapter
on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek other action as is
appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user
to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 59.126 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS; ANNUAL PUBLICATION.
   (A)   Annual publication of list of users who are in significant non-
compliance. The Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of
users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant non-compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   Definition of "significant non-compliance". For purposes of this
section, SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE shall be defined as follows, unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4

§ 59.128 OPERATING UPSET DEFENSE.
   (A)   "Upset" defined. For the purpose of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      UPSET. An exceptional incident in which there is an unintentional and
temporary non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An UPSET does not include
non-compliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   (B)   Use of upset as an affirmative defense. An upset shall constitute an
affirmative defense to an action brought for non-compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards if the requirements of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   Elements of defense. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative
defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the non-compliance.
   (D)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Variability of judicial determination. Users will have the opportunity
for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement
action brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Reduction; loss or failure user's treatment facility.
      (1)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
      (2)   This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 59.129 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for non-compliance with the general prohibitions or the specific
prohibitions of this code if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference, and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 733, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 59.130 BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   When bypass may be permitted. A user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of divisions (C) and (D) of
this section.
   (C)   Notice to the Superintendent.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Circumstances in which bypass may be allowed.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) above.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects; if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

roads, streets, highways or right-of-ways maintained by the city Street
Department (“streets”). The mandatory provisions of this section and of any
local disaster emergency issued pursuant to this section, including the
prohibitions on travel, and the penalties for violating those prohibitions
shall not apply to a county road maintained by Noble County nor to a state
highway maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   The Mayor, after consultation with the Chief of Police, and the
Street Department Superintendent, if available, or the respective
representative designated by each person as the person to consult in his or her
absence for the purpose of recommending a declaration of local disaster
emergency, may declare a local disaster emergency which may also contain a
“warning level” travel advisory by executive order when, in the Mayor’s
judgment, such order would be appropriate under I.C. 10-14-3-29 and in the best
interest of the public safety and welfare of the residents of the City of
Ligonier, Indiana.
      (2)   If, with or without the issuance of a declaration of local disaster
emergency, the Mayor determines that conditions require an “advisory” or
“watch” level of travel advisory, the Mayor may issue an “advisory” or a
“watch” travel advisory.
      (3)   Pursuant to I.C. 10-14-3-29.5, a “warning” level travel advisory
may be issued only after or as a part of a declaration of local disaster
emergency. Such emergency shall continue in effect until the Mayor, and/or
officials or their respective designees who declared the emergency thereafter
determine an emergency no longer exists and terminate the emergency order.
      (4)   The Mayor may declare a “warning” level travel advisory upon his or
her determination that the conditions are appropriate for the issuance of a
local disaster emergency under I.C. 10-14-3-29, and the further determination
that the criteria set forth in division (C) below have been met.
   (C)   Local travel advisories. A local travel advisory shall be declared in
accordance with I.C. 10-14-3-29.5 and this section. The purpose of a local

informed of the weather and city street conditions, and to assist the Ligonier
Street Department in the cleaning of city streets by eliminating stranded
vehicles.

routine travel or activities may be restricted in areas of the city because of
a hazardous situation; citizens should use caution or avoid these areas.
Schools and businesses may begin to implement their emergency action plans.

conditions are threatening to the safety of the public. Only essential travel
is recommended (i.e., to and from work, emergency situations, and the like). At
this level, emergency action plans should be implemented by businesses,
schools, government agencies and other organizations.
      (3)   Warning level travel advisory. This level may be declared when
streets have become impassable and the Ligonier Street Department is not able
to keep the streets clear due to extreme weather conditions such as a severe
snow fall, high drifts or blizzard like conditions are present. Travel may be
restricted to emergency management workers ONLY, and essential emergency travel
by members of the public as the Mayor may further direct, such as privately
employed health care workers. Further restrictions that the Mayor deems
necessary may be included within the local disaster declaration.
   (D)   Publication. Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing, or
terminating a local disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general
publicity and shall be filed promptly in the office of the Clerk of the City of
Ligonier pursuant to I.C. 10-14-3-22(b)(2). Publication and broadcast of an
advisory, watch or warning level travel advisory shall be made or caused to be
made by the Mayor or such other officials designating the level of travel
advisory using a press release to all law enforcement agencies, fire
departments, hospitals and news media in the city. The declaration shall be
promptly forwarded to the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, and shall be
kept on file by the Clerk-Treasurer of the City of Ligonier.

restrictions imposed in a travel advisory pursuant to this section shall
include medical assistance, law enforcement, Fire Department, emergency
management, public utility, and fuel hauling vehicles, and employees of any of
the above exempt services, if engaged in performing their respective duties.
Any other vehicles violating this section or any of the parking restrictions
contained in local declaration of disaster emergency or a “warning” travel
advisory are subject to removal by towing or other means at the expense of the
owner of the vehicle, when such towing and/or removal is deemed necessary by a
duly authorized representative of either the Ligonier Street Department, or the

notice to abate to be served upon the owner of the property in question,
granting that owner a minimum of seven calendar days in which to remove the
environmental nuisance. This notice shall be served by a law enforcement
officer, by certified mail to the owner, or by a “notice” placard conspicuously
posted on the property which contains the following information: the address of
the property, the date of the notice, the address and the telephone number of
the office of the Inspector, and a warning that if the environmental public
nuisance is not removed within seven calendar days after posting, the city will
abate the nuisance and seek recovery of the actual costs (as determined herein)
involved in the removal of the nuisance. The notice will also contain a short
and plain statement of the owner’s or occupant’s right to object to the notice
and the manner and time for making such objection.
   (B)   The Inspector, after posting a notice to abate, shall serve on the
owner of the subject property a copy of the notice by regular first class
United States mail, postage prepaid, and provided further that any failure to
give such written notice shall not constitute a defense to any action to
enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   After an initial notice of violation of this chapter, as provided by
certified mail, or other service, under this section, a continuous abatement
notice may be posted on the subject property at the time of the subsequent
violation instead of by certified mail or equivalent service required under
this section. A continuous abatement notice shall serve as notice to the real
property owner that each subsequent violation during the same year for which
the initial notice of violation was provided may be abated by the city or its
contractors.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the Subdivision
Ordinance of Ligonier, Indiana.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.002 POLICY.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to consider the
subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat as
subject to the official Comprehensive Plan and related policies, such as those
embodied in the city's Zoning Ordinance for the orderly and efficient
development of the city and jurisdictional area.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be
developed without peril to health or peril from flood, fire or other menace,
and land shall not be subdivided until having access and until improvements and
proper provision have been made for drainage, water, sewerage, other necessary
new public improvements such as schools, parks, recreation facilities and
transportation facilities adequate for serving the subdivision. Private wells
and septic systems in lieu of public water and sewer facilities are allowable
only in the jurisdictional area or where permitted under the Zoning Ordinance
and approved by the County Health Department.
   (C)   Both existing and proposed public facilities serving the subdivision
shall be properly related and conform to the official Comprehensive Plan,
related policies and implementation programs including the official map, Zoning
Ordinance, Housing and Building Codes.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.003 PURPOSE.
   (A)   To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general
welfare of the city and the jurisdictional area.
   (B)   To guide the future development and renewal of the city and the
jurisdictional area in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and related
policies.
   (C)   To provide for the safety, comfort and soundness of the buildings,
structures and related open spaces.
   (D)   To protect the compatibility, character, economic stability and
orderliness of all development through reasonable design standards.
   (E)   To guide public and private policy and action to provide adequate and
efficient public and private facilities, the most aesthetically pleasing and
beneficial interrelationship between land uses, conserve natural resources such
as natural beauty, woodlands, open spaces and energy both during and after
development.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.004 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Please refer to §
156.004 for definitions of key terms.
   (B)   The meanings of these terms are the same in both the Subdivision
Ordinance and Zoning Ordinance, unless context clearly indicates otherwise.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.005 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This chapter, which was enacted pursuant to state home rule and
planning enabling legislation (I.C. 36-1-3-4 and the 36-7-4-700 series, as
amended) authorizes the Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove
plats for subdivision throughout the city's jurisdiction which show lots,
blocks or sites with or without new streets or highways. This, authority
extends to the development or resubdivision of undeveloped portions of already
recorded plats.
   (B)   No improvement location permit or certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for any parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after
the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these
subdivision regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any
public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in
conformity with the regulations contained herein and in conformity with
construction standards adopted by the state.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.006 ENACTMENT.
   In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, these subdivision regulations are hereby adopted.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.007 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions:
      (1)   Public provisions. The regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control; and
      (2)   Private provisions.
         (a)   These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement,
covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided that where the
provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards
or regulations than the easement, covenant or other private agreement or
restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
         (b)   Where the provisions of the easement covenant, or private
agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or
higher standards than the requirements of these regulations, or the
determinations of the Commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing
these regulations, and the private provisions are not inconsistent with these
regulations or determinations thereunder, then the private provisions shall be
operative and supplemental to these regulations and determinations made
thereunder.
         (c)   Note: Private provisions can only be enforced privately unless a
public agency has been made party to the agreements.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.008 SAVING PROVISION.
   These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as
waiving any right of the city under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm or corporation, by lawful action of the city
except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.009 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety and general
welfare, the city, on recommendation of the Commission, may from time to time
amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. Public hearings
on all proposed amendments shall be held by the Commission and/or the city in
the manner prescribed by law.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.010 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to this city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement and restrictive use of the land in order to conform to the physical
and economical development of the city and jurisdictional area and to the
safety and general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of
the city and jurisdictional area at large.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.011 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if the change affects any street layout shown on the
map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects
any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any regulations
controlling subdivisions, the parcel shall be approved by the Commission by the
same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
the lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller building sites, the
Commission may require that the parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of the streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.012 VACATION OF PLATS.
   Any recorded plat or part of any recorded plat may be vacated only in
accordance with the Indiana Code.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.013 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by
an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that the variances shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the
Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contravene the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan or official map as interpreted by the
Commission and the City and/or County Engineer.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.014 ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce these regulations and
to bring any violations or lack of compliance to the attention of the City
Attorney.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES
§ 155.025 GENERAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Discussion of requirements.
      (1)   Prior to submitting any of the materials required by this chapter,
the applicant or his or her representative should discuss with the
Administrator the nature of the land division being proposed, so that the
applicant may be instructed concerning the classification of his or her
subdivision and what regulatory procedures apply to it and must be followed
under this chapter in order to secure primary and secondary approval. Where
applicable, requirements concerning the general layout of streets and for
reservations of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection
and similar matters, as well as the availability of existing services should be
discussed.
      (2)   The Administrator shall also advise the applicant, where
appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those other officials
who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision plat coming within
their jurisdiction.
      (3)   The distinction between major and minor subdivisions and exempt
divisions as defined in this chapter, shall be made by the Administrator when
the applicant submits an application for sketch plan approval in the case of
major and minor subdivisions, or, in the case of exempt divisions, provides the
Administrator at a pre-design conference with adequate information to enable
him or her to determine that the proposed division is an exempt division.
   (B)   Classification of land divisions.
      (1)   All land to be divided shall be categorized into one of the three
mail classes of land division indicated in this chapter's definition of
subdivision.
      (2)   These classes are:
         (a)   Major subdivisions;
         (b)   Minor subdivisions; and
         (c)   Exempt divisions.
      (3)   Exempt divisions are not subject to the requirements of this
chapter beyond the determination by the Administrator that they meet all the
requirements for exempt divisions set forth in §
155.029. However, lots created by exempt divisions (except Exemption F) shall
be ten or more acres in size to be eligible as principal use building sites
(Exemption A), unless the lots have been created by order of a court (Exemption
C). No building site for principle use created through Exemption A shall be
reduced below ten acres unless through subdivision or by order of a court
(Exemption C). For purposes of this division, a lot is "created" on the date of
its recording. (See
Table 3.2 in §
155.029(B) below, for definition of exempt divisions.)
      (4)   Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on
land to be subdivided into a major or minor subdivision, the subdividing owner
or his or her subdivision agent shall apply for and secure approval of the
proposed subdivision in accordance with §
155.026 and either §§
155.027 or
155.028 as appropriate. Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to
be erected on a parcel of land to be created or altered by an exempt division,
the land divider or his or her agent shall certify to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that all requirements for exemption have been met, as detailed in
§
155.029, in order to exempt the land division from all other requirements of
this chapter.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.026 MAJOR AND MINOR SUBDIVISIONS; SKETCH PLAN APPLICATION PROCEDURE;
PRIMARY APPROVAL.
   (A)   Application requirements.
      (1)   In order to begin the subdivision process, the applicant shall file
an application for review of sketch plan and certificate with the Administrator
and be entitled to a signed receipt for same.
      (2)   This application shall:
         (a)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Commission and
signed by the owner;
         (b)   Include indication of all contiguous holdings of the owner
including land in the same ownership, with an indication of the portion which
is proposed to be subdivided, accompanied by an affidavit of ownership, which
shall include the dates the respective holdings of land were acquired, together
with the book and page of each conveyance to the present owner as recorded in
the County Recorder's office. The affidavit shall advise as to the legal owner
of the property, the contract owner of the property, optionee of the property,
and the date on which the contract of sale was executed, if any corporations
are involved, the Administrator may request a complete list of all directors,
officers and a listing of stockholders if less than ten in number;
         (c)   Be presented to the Administrator in duplicate;
         (d)   Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the sketch plan;
         (e)   Be accompanied by a fee of $50 for minor subdivisions and $75 or
$10 per lot, whichever is greater;
         (f)   Include an address and telephone number of an agent located
within the territory of the commission who shall be authorized to receive all
notices required by this chapter; and
         (g)   Include a listing signed by the checkpoint agencies indicating
that they have received a copy of the proposed sketch plan or a certification
that it has been sent.
   (B)   Checkpoint submission. In order to fulfill this last application
requirement, a copy of the proposed plan shall be submitted to each of the
agencies appropriate to the plan's location so that their comment may be made
to the Administrator. The checkpoint agencies appropriate to each participating
jurisdiction in which a plat may be located are listed in
Table 3-1, in division (C) below. The Administrator shall request that all
officials and agencies to whom a request for review has been made submit a
written report to him or her within 15 days after receipt of the request. No
response from an agency shall be interpreted as meaning "no objection."
   (C)   Classification of subdivision. After an application for sketch plan
approval has been submitted, and at the time of sketch plan review the
Administrator shall classify the proposed subdivision as either major or minor
as defined in this chapter. The required procedures and approvals for major
subdivisions are described in §
155.027; corresponding information concerning the minor subdivision approval
process is provided in §
155.028.

(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.027 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures for primary and secondary approval. Should the
Administrator, during the sketch plan review, classify the proposed land
division as a major subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and
be subject to the processes outlined in
Figure 3-1 in §
155.026 above, and detailed by this section. In addition to a sketch plan which
is reviewed by the Administrator and checkpoint agencies, the applicant seeking
approval of a major subdivision shall submit a preliminary subdivision plat to
be approved, conditionally approved or rejected by the Commission at a public
meeting, and a final subdivision plat which must be found in compliance with
the preliminary plat as approved by the Commission or otherwise approved in
order to be signed and recorded.
   (B)   Official submission dates. The deadline for submittal of a sketch plan
and application for certificate of approval shall be 61 calendar days prior to
the date of the public meeting at which the subdivider intends to have his or
her preliminary plat submission heard, and 31 calendar days prior to the
deadline for the submission of the preliminary plat. Thus, as a minimum, sketch
plan submission shall precede preliminary plat submission by no less than 31
calendar days, which in turn shall precede the public hearing at which it is
intended to be heard by no less than 30 calendar days.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the subdivided
sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have studied the
proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the subdivider to
discuss pertinent aspects of the possible modifications and/or changes that may
be suggested or required by this chapter. The Administrator shall request that
a representative of each checkpoint agency wishing to be involved in a sketch
plan review be present to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In
taking into consideration the requirements of this chapter, particular
attention shall be given to the arrangement, location and width of streets,
their relation to the topography of the land, sewage disposal, drainage, lot
size and arrangement, the further development of adjoining lands as yet
unsubdivided, and the requirements of the official map and Comprehensive Plan
as adopted by the participating jurisdictions. Subsequent to this meeting, the
Administrator shall provide the participants with a written record of the
proceedings of that meeting.
   (D)   Preliminary plat procedures for primary approval.
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following the submission, review and
report on the sketch plan application, the subdivider may file for primary
approval of a preliminary plat. This submission shall:
         (a)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Commission and
be submitted with fee of $5 per lot for each lot which was not included in the
sketch plan;
         (b)   Include indication of all land which the applicant proposes to
subdivide and all land immediately adjacent and across any street or railroad
right-of-way, extending 600 feet therefrom, but not more than two property
owners deep from the proposed subdivision, with the names and addresses of the
title owners as shown in the files. This information may be shown on a separate
current plat map reproduction of the city and/or county showing the boundaries
of the subdivision superimposed thereon;
         (c)   Be presented in duplicate to the Administrator no later than 30
calendar days prior to the regular meeting of the Commission at which it is
intended to be heard;
         (d)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the preliminary plat as
described in this chapter; and
         (e)   Generally comply with the sketch plan as reviewed.
      (2)   Placement on the Commission agenda. Subsequent to the submission
for primary approval, the Commission shall place the matter on its next regular
meeting agenda for formal action.
      (3)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
prior to the date of public hearing, the Administrator and other appropriate
members of the Commission including its President and Secretary shall review
the proposal and prepare a report to the entire Commission and applicant
indicating a recommendation with regard to the subdivision being proposed.
      (4)   Public hearing notification requirements. The Commission shall hold
a public hearing on the preliminary plat and notice of the hearing shall be per
I.C. 5-3-1, at the applicant's expense. Interested parties shall also be
notified by the applicant of the date, time, place and purpose of the public
hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the hearing by
certified mail. The applicant shall file with the Commission at the time of the
public hearing an affidavit so testifying along with the certified mail
receipts provided by the post office.
      (5)   Primary approval of the preliminary plat. After the Commission has
held a hearing upon the preliminary plat, the Administrator’s report,
checkpoint recommendations, testimony and exhibits submitted at the public
hearing, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or
additions. The Commission shall, at a public hearing, grant primary approval,
or disapprove the preliminary plat. One copy of the preliminary plat shall be
returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval or
disapproval and the reasons therefor accompanying the plat within five days of
the public hearing. Before the Commission approves a preliminary plat showing
park reservation(s) or land for another local governmental unit, the Commission
shall obtain approval of the park or land reservation from the participating
jurisdiction. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to review by
certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until a minimum of
30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval.
      (6)   Field trip. The Commission, at its discretion, upon hearing the
request for primary approval, may elect to continue the matter until its next
regularly scheduled public meeting, and may schedule a field trip to the site
of the proposed subdivision, accompanied by the applicant or his or her
representative or any other person or persons at the discretion of the
Commission.
      (7)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year
after the date of primary approval, at the end of which time secondary approval
of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by the designated
officials. Any plats not receiving secondary approval within the period of time
set forth herein shall be null and void, and the developer shall be required to
resubmit a new application for sketch plan review and certificate subject to
all the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations in effect at the time
of re-submission. Upon request of the applicant, the Commission may extend the
primary approval of a preliminary plat in increments of one year beyond an
expiration date without further notice and public hearing.
   (E)   Approval of construction plans.
      (1)   Submission procedure and requirements. Following the review of the
sketch plan and prior to submission of the final plat for secondary approval,
the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file
with the Administrator before starting work on any improvements five sets of
the detailed plans and specifications thereof for approval.
      (2)   Review process. The Administrator shall immediately refer these
plans to the appropriate agencies of the affected participating jurisdictions
for review. Once these agencies indicate their approval of the construction
plans or 14 working days have elapsed since their distribution without a
written response, the Administrator shall stamp the plans approved and return
one set to the applicant. In no event shall secondary approval (of the final
plat) be given prior to approval of the construction plans.
      (3)   Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements
shall be inspected by the appropriate participating jurisdiction. The
inspections are required in all instances regardless of whether the work is
performed before or after secondary approval. Failure to request or to procure
inspection of work performed after the date of this chapter and before
secondary approval may be cause for denial of secondary approval.
   (F)   Final plat procedure (secondary approval).
      (1)   Submission requirements. Following primary approval or conditional
primary approval of the preliminary plat and approval of the construction
plans, the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed with the subdivision,
shall file with the Administrator a request for secondary approval of a final
plat. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the Office of the Commission;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof which derives
access from an existing state, county or municipal roadway;
         (c)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the final plat as described in
this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions
of primary approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission upon recommendation of the participating jurisdiction and shall
guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public
improvements; and
         (f)   Be accompanied by any restrictive covenants in a form approved
by the Commission, where they have been proposed by the subdivider or required
by the Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final plat shall either be found to be in conformance with the
primary approval by the Administrator, or by the Commission at a public
hearing. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the preliminary plat that
received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the
Commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval. The subdivider
submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to
whether this review is to be performed by the Administrator, or by the
Commission at a public meeting.
         (a)   Should the subdivider not choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall within ten working days, review the items submitted as per
§
155.028(H)(1) below, in order to ascertain the sufficiency as to conformance
with the primary approval, if the submission is found to be in conformance and
complete, the Administrator shall recommend to the Commission the signing of
the certificate granting secondary approval.
         (b)   Should the subdivider choose Commission review, the Commission
shall determine conformance with the primary approval at a public hearing. The
subdivider shall request Commission review in writing no less than 30 calendar
days prior to the date of the public hearing at which he or she intends to have
his or her final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the matter on its
next regular hearing agenda. The Administrator shall review the proposal and
submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and the
applicant; and, at the public hearing, the Commission shall approve or
disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval it shall be signed by
the designated officials, if not granted secondary approval, then the
subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his or her submittal.
         (c)   Sectionalizing plats:
            1.   Prior to granting secondary approval of a major subdivision
plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more
sections and may impose conditions upon the filing of the sections as it may
deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat;
            2.   The Commission may require that the performance bond be in
such an amount as will be commensurate with the section or sections of the plat
to be filed and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal
amount until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing;
            3.   Those sections must contain at least 20 lots or 10% of the
total number of lots contained in the approved plat, whichever is less; and
            4.   The approval of all remaining sections not filed with the
Administrator shall automatically expire after two years from the date of
primary approval of the preliminary plat, unless the expiration date has been
extended.
   (G)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
designated officials of the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate only after the bond and the construction plans have
been approved, and all the conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required, the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval of the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), "as built" construction plans submitted (as
required by §
155.065(B)(5) and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
155.067(B) below). There shall be written evidence that the required public
facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating
jurisdiction as shown by a certificate signed by the appropriate entity, i.e.
Board of Works, County Commissioners and/or the County Drainage Board, that the
necessary improvements have been accomplished.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of final plat. The designated officials shall sign the
certificate which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of
the subdivision plat, plus three Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The
Mylar prints shall be returned to the subdivider and his or her engineer or
surveyor. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence of
the Administrator or his or her designee to file the plat with the County
Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of the subdivider to
file the plat as herein provided within 30 days shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.028 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedures for approval. Should the Administrator, upon
examination of the sketch plan application, classify the proposed land division
as a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and be
subject to the process outlined in
Figure 3-2 in division (C) below and detailed in this section. In addition to a
sketch plan which is reviewed by the Administrator and checkpoint agencies for
primary approval by the Commission, the applicant seeking approval of a minor
subdivision shall submit for secondary approval a final subdivision plat which
must be found in compliance with the sketch plan or otherwise approved by the
Commission in order to be signed and recorded.
   (B)   Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application
for sketch plan approval shall be submitted no less than that 30 calendar days
prior to either a regularly scheduled public meeting of the Commission or a
specially called meeting at which the proposal is intended to be acted upon.
The Administrator shall place the application on the agenda of the first
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission or a specially called meeting to
occur 30 days after the date on which a complete application is submitted.
   (C)   Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the
subdivider's sketch plan application submittal, the Administrator shall have
studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received and met with the
subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and
possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this
chapter. The Administrator shall request that a representative of each
checkpoint agency that wishes to be involved in a sketch plan review be present
to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration
the requirements of this chapter, particular attention shall be given to sewage
disposal, drainage, lot size and arrangement, the further development of
adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the official map
and Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the participating jurisdictions.
Subsequent to the meeting, the Administrator shall provide the participants
with a written record of the proceedings of that meeting.

   (D)   Administrative review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and
prior to the date of public hearing, the Administrator and other appropriate
members of the Commission including the President and Secretary of the
Commission shall review the proposal and prepare a written report to the
Commission and applicant indicating a recommendation with regard to the
subdivision being proposed.
   (E)   Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the sketch plan and notice of the
hearing shall be per I.C. 5-3-1, at the applicant's expense. At the time of the
public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the
applicant has placed posters provided by the Administrator (advising interested
parties of the hearing) at the locations designated by him or her on the
proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing and
show proofs of publication that notices of public hearing were published at
least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties shall be
notified by the applicant of the date, time, place and purpose of the public
hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the public hearing
an affidavit so testifying, along with the certified mail receipts provided by
the post office.
   (F)   Primary approval of the sketch plan.
      (1)   After the Commission has, at a regularly scheduled hearing,
examined the sketch plan, Administrator's report, checkpoint recommendations,
testimony and exhibits submitted, the Commission shall, at a regularly
scheduled hearing, approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the sketch
plan.
      (2)   One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the applicant with
the date of approval, conditional approval or disapproval and the reasons
therefor accompanying the sketch plan within five days after the public
hearing. Primary approval by the Commission is subject to review by certiorari.
Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until a minimum of 30 days has
elapsed since the granting of primary approval or conditional approval or
conditional primary approval.
   (G)   Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the primary
approval of a minor sketch plan shall be effective for a period of one year
after the date of the primary approval, at the end of which time secondary
approval of the subdivision must have been obtained and certified by the
President and Secretary of the Commission. Any plats not receiving secondary
approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and
the developer shall be required to resubmit a new application for sketch plan
review and certificate, subject to all the zoning restrictions and subdivision
regulations in effect at the time of re-submission. Upon written application of
the applicant, the Commission may extend the primary approval of a minor sketch
plan in increments of one year beyond an expiration date without further notice
and public hearing.
   (H)   Final subdivision plat procedure for secondary approval.
      (1)   Application requirements. Following approval or conditional
approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant, if he or she wishes to proceed
with the subdivision, shall file with the Administrator an application for
secondary approval of a subdivision plat. The application shall:
         (a)   Be submitted on forms available at the office of the Commission;
         (b)   Include the entire subdivision or section thereof;
         (c)   Be accompanied by ten copies of the final subdivision plat as
described in this chapter;
         (d)   Totally comply with the chapter and the terms and conditions of
approval;
         (e)   Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form
satisfactory to the Commission Attorney and in an amount established by the
Commission upon recommendation of the participating jurisdiction and shall
guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public
improvements; and
         (f)   Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by
the Commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the Commission.
      (2)   Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be
recorded, a final subdivision plat shall either be found to be in conformance
with the approved sketch plan by the Administrator, or by the Commission at a
public hearing, if the final subdivision plat deviates from the sketch plan
that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the
Commission at a public hearing for a new primary approval. The subdivider
submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to
whether this review is performed by the Administrator or by the Commission at a
public hearing.
         (a)   Should the subdivider not choose Commission review, the
Administrator shall within ten working days, review the items submitted as per
division (H)(1) above in order to ascertain conformance with the primary
approval. If the submission is found to be in conformance and complete, the
Administrator shall recommend to the Commission the signing of the certificate
granting secondary approval.
         (b)   Should the subdivider choose Commission review, the Commission
shall determine conformance with the primary approval at a public hearing. The
subdivider shall request Commission review in writing no less than 30 calendar
days prior to the date of the public hearing at which he or she intends to have
his or her final plat reviewed. The Commission shall place the matter on its
next regular hearing agenda. The Administrator shall review the proposal and
submit a written report and recommendations to the Commission and the
applicant; and, at the public hearing, the Commission shall give secondary
approval or disapproval of the final plat. If approved, it shall be signed by
the designated officials, if not approved, the subdivider shall be informed as
to the insufficiency of his or her submittal.
         (c)   Prior to granting secondary approval of a minor subdivision
plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more
sections and may impose the conditions upon the filing of the sections as it
may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The
Commission may require that the performance bond be in the amount as is
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing.
   (I)   Signing and recording a plat.
      (1)   Signing of plat.
         (a)   When the filing of a performance bond is required, the
designated officials of the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after the bond and construction plans have been
approved and all the conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied.
         (b)   When installation of improvements is required the designated
officials of the Commission shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by
signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been
satisfied, all improvements satisfactorily completed and accepted for public
maintenance (when required), "as built" construction plans submitted (as
required by §
155.065(B)(5)), and a maintenance bond provided (as required by §
155.067(B)). There shall be written evidence that the required public
facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating
jurisdiction as shown by a certificate signed by the appropriate Board of
Works, County Commissioners and/or the County Drainage Board that the necessary
improvements have been accomplished.
      (2)   Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all
improvements before he or she applies for secondary approval and it is shown
that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat
completely conforms to the primary approval, the Commission shall have no other
recourse than to grant secondary approval.
      (3)   Recording of plat.
         (a)   The designated officials shall sign the certificate granting
secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible
Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus three Mylar prints of the subdivision plat.
The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his or her engineer or
surveyor.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to file the
plat in the presence of the Commission's Administrator or his or her designee
with the County Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure of
the subdivider to file the plat as herein provided within 30 days shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.029 EXEMPT DIVISIONS.
   (A)   General procedure for exempt divisions.
      (1)   In order for a land division to be considered an exempt division
the information prescribed for the applicable type of division under §
155.084 below shall be submitted to the Administrator so that he or she can
determine whether the division meets the provisions of the definition in
Table 3.2 in §
155.029(B) below and the requirements in §
155.025 above for this classification and therefore can issue to the subdivider
a statement of compliance to the applicable provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Both the subdivider and the Administrator shall hold copies of the
statement of compliance.
      (3)   When the parcel so exempted by this statement is conveyed to
another party, the copy of the instrument of the conveyance shall be recorded
with the County Recorder bearing a stamp of approval signed by the
Administrator indicating that the statement of compliance has been obtained as
ascertained by the copy(s) of the statement which have been held for this
purpose.
   (B)   Exempt division review process. Within three working days of the land
divider's complete submission of the required information (see §
155.084 below), the Administrator shall review the submission and notify the
land divider that his or her proposed land division either qualifies as an
exempt division and is thus exempt from all other provisions of this chapter,
or does not qualify as an exempt division and is thus subject to the relevant
subdivision processes described in this chapter.

REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS AND DESIGN
§ 155.040 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and local statutory provisions;
      (2)   The Zoning Ordnance, Building and Housing Codes and all other
applicable laws and ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions;
      (3)   The Comprehensive Plan and official map, including all streets,
drainage systems and parks shown on the official map or Comprehensive Plan as
adopted;
      (4)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies;
      (5)   The rules and regulations of the State Department of Transportation
if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abut a state highway or state
frontage road;
      (6)   The highway and drainage standards and regulations adopted by the
County Engineer and all boards, commissions, agencies and officials of the
county and/or city; and
      (7)   All pertinent standards contained within valid planning guides
published by the Plan Commission.
   (B)   Plat approval. Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not
in conformity with the above guides and requirements or with the policies and
purposes of these regulations established in §
155.003 above.
   (C)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance or these regulations, the restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Commission will
require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder in a
form to be approved by the Commission Attorney.
   (D)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries.
      (1)   Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in
another jurisdiction, the Commission may request assurance that the access is
legally established, and from the City Engineer (within corporate limits) or
County Engineer (within jurisdictional area) that the access road is adequately
improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient
in the amount to assure the construction of the access road.
      (2)   Lot lines shall be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary
lines.
   (E)   Boundary improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, concrete monuments four inches square or four inches
in diameter.
         (a)   The center of all monuments shall be marked on the top by a
steel dowel at least one-half-inch in diameter, set flush with the top.
         (b)   Monuments shall be set so that the top is slightly below the
adjoining established grade and shall be installed at the following points,
following grading of each phase of the subdivision:
            1.   At the intersection of street and alley right-of-way lines;
            2.   At the beginning and ending of all street curves on both
right-of-way lines; and
            3.   At all boundary corners of the dedicated plat area and
dedicated public areas.
      (2)   The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a
registered land surveyor, iron pipe or iron and steel bars, at least five-
eighths-inch in diameter by three feet in length at the corners of each lot not
marked by monuments required above.
         (a)   The top of the pipe or bar shall be set level with the
established grade adjoining it.
         (b)   They shall be set prior to the issuance of any improvement
location permit.
   (F)   Character of the land. Land which the Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements or other features which might reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Commission, upon recommendation of the County and/or City
Engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. the
land shall be set aside for the uses permitted by the Zoning Ordinance as shall
not involve any danger.
   (G)   Subdivision name.
      (1)   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too
closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area
covered by these regulations.
      (2)   The Commission shall have final authority to designate the name of
the subdivision which shall be determined at the time of primary approval.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.041 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement.
      (1)   The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in securing
improvement location permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on the lots from the appropriate approved street.
      (2)   Every lot shall front or abut on a street.
      (3)   Lots shall have a front to front relationship across all streets
where possible. This shall be accomplished to assure that houses do not face
rear or side yards of lots across streets wherever possible.
      (4)   Where lots border upon bodies of water, the front yard may be
designated as the waterfront side of the lot provided the lot has sufficient
depth to provide adequate setback on the street side to maintain a setback for
all structures equal to the setback on the street side as well as on the
waterfront side.
   (B)   Lot dimensions.
      (1)   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards in the
Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the
zoning district, the Commission may require that the lots be arranged so as to
allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be
necessary to serve all the potential lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and these regulations.
      (3)   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule
will give a better street or lot plan.
      (4)   Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both
streets.
      (5)   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for all of the
off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
      (6)   Excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A depth
to width ratio of two to one shall normally be considered the maximum. See
Figure 4-1 below.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide for the separation of
residential development from the traffic on bordering arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation affecting the subdivided
lots. See
Figure 4-2. below.
      (2)   Access from primary and secondary arterials.
         (a)   Lots shall not, in general, derive access from a primary or
secondary arterial street.
         (b)   Where driveway access from a primary or secondary arterial
street may be the only possible access for several adjoining lots, the
Commission may require that the lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazards from multiple access to the streets.
         (c)   Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as
to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on primary or secondary
arterials.

   (D)   Soil preservation, grading and seeding.
      (1)   Soil preservation and final grading. No certificates of occupancy
shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the
approved construction plans and the lot pre-covered with topsoil having an
average depth of at least six inches which shall contain no particles over two
inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered
by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or
natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from
residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide
at least six inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be
stabilized by seeding or planting.
      (2)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the
lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for
in the approved construction plans.
      (3)   Lawn-grass seed and sod. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less
than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. The seed shall be sown
between March 15 and September 30. The seed shall consist of a minimum of 10%
rye grass by weight and a minimum of 90% of permanent bluegrass by weight. All
seed shall have been tested for germination within one year of the date of
seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label containing the seed
analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the road side edge of the unpaved
right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal residence on
the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until re-spreading of soil
and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between October 15 and
March 15 and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant shall submit an
agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property owner, with a
copy to the improvement location permit official, that the spreading of the
soil and seeding of the lawn will be done during the immediately following
planting season as set forth above in this section, and leave a cash escrow for
performance in an amount as shall be determined by the improvement location
permit official. Sod may be used to comply with any requirement of seeding set
forth herein.
   (E)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish or other waste material of any kind shall be buried in any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of occupancy within
a subdivision, nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (F)   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed according to standards
established by the County and/or City Engineer and shall be noted as to height
and material on the final plat. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued
until the fence improvements have been duly installed.
   (G)   Waterbodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute
the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Commission may approve an alternative allocation of interests whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so
placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No part of
the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied
by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area
of a lot from the street from which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure, of a design approved by the
County and/or City Engineer.
   (H)   Performance bond to include lot improvement. The performance bond
shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained
in this section, including, but not limited to, soil preservation, final
grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing
and all other lot improvements required by the Commission. Whether or not a
certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the expiration of the performance
bond, the city may enforce the provisions of the bond where compliance with the
provisions of this section or any other applicable law, ordinance or regulation
has not occurred.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.042 STREETS.
   (A)   General requirements; frontage on improved streets. No subdivision
shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and
access from an existing street on the official map, or if there is not an
official map, unless the street is:
      (1)   An existing state, county or township highway, or
      (2)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and recorded
in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds. The street or highway must be
suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulations, specifications
or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under these
regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these regulations or
as indicated on the official map or Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever the area to be
subdivided is to use an existing street frontage, the street shall be suitably
improved as provided herein above.
   (B)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the city construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the County or City Engineer, in
accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to
secondary approval.
   (C)   Topography and arrangement.
      (1)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and sharp curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on
the official map or Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   All arterials and collector streets shall be properly related to
special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land uses.
      (4)   Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to the property.
      (5)   Rigid, rectangular "gridiron" street patterns are generally to be
avoided, and the use of casually curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs or loop
streets shall be encouraged where the use will result in a more desirable lay-
out and relate better to the existing topography. On flat land, innovative,
varying geometrical street patterns shall be encouraged where they are likely
to enhance visual interest and a sense of order for those using them (e.g.,
non-grid rectilinear, trapezoidal, polygonal or other geometric patterns).
      (6)   Proposed streets shall, where appropriate, be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless this is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Plan
Commission the extension(s) is/are not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision under consideration with the
existing street layout or for the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts (see division (K)(1) below).
      (7)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access-ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways and parking areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
   (D)   Blocks.
      (1)   Block width shall be determined by the condition of the layout and
shall be suited to the intended layout.
      (2)   Block lengths shall not exceed 660 feet in length, except where in
the opinion of the Commission conditions may justify a greater distance.
      (3)   The Commission may require the reservation of easements through the
block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or pedestrian traffic.
Pedestrian ways or crosswalks not less than six feet wide with a pavement width
of not less than five feet may be required by the Commission through the center
of blocks more than 800 feet long or at other appropriate locations and at the
ends of the cul-de-sacs where deemed essential to provide for circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other
community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of a length
and width as may be determined to be suitable by the Commission for the
intended use.
   (E)   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single-family
residential subdivisions, fronting on collector streets shall be avoided and
lots at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall
front on the local street and have driveway access to it only and not to the
collector street. In multiple-family residential areas, entrances to group
parking lots shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and
the entrances shall be widely spaced.
   (F)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of the lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along
the rear property line of the lots;
      (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs, or loop streets entered from, and designed
generally to be at right angles to an access street that is at some distance
from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their terminal
lots backing onto the arterial; and
      (3)   A private marginal access or service road (separated from the
arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass strip and having
access thereto at widely spaced suitable points).
   (G)   Street names. The sketch plan, as submitted, shall indicate names of
proposed streets. As part of his or her review, the Administrator shall refer
proposed street names to the local postmaster for his or her comments regarding
duplication of names and possible confusion. After reviewing them, the
Administrator shall inform the subdivider of his or her recommendations for
their possible revision during the sketch plan review. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the
city, county or other nearby areas so as to avoid confusion. A street which is,
or is planned as, a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same
name. Street name signs shall be installed at every intersection and shall
comply with current city or county standards.
   (H)   Street regulatory signs. The applicant shall provide and install a
street sign at every street intersection within his or her subdivision as
required by the City and/or County Engineer. All street signs shall be
inspected and approved before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any
residence on the approved streets. Signs must comply with requirements in the
most recent edition of the Uniform Traffic Control Manual.
   (I)   Street lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the City and/or
County Engineer. Street light standards and fixtures shall also be in
accordance with the visual design standards of the Design Review Committee. If
special decorative lighting is used, the additional cost over that of standard
lighting shall be paid through a homeowners' association.
   (J)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access to it from
adjacent property if the street is a local service street rather than a
collector or arterial street. (See divisions (E) and (F) above.)
   (K)   Construction of streets.
      (1)   Construction of streets other than cul-de-sacs. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent
subdivisions or other properties when the continuation is necessary for the
convenient movement of traffic, for effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities, and where the continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan, if the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
be a dead-end (stub) street temporarily, the right-of-way for all the temporary
dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside
the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is
continued. Temporary turnarounds must be provided at the ends of the stub
streets. The Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in
accordance with the design standards in these regulations.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs (permanent dead-end streets). Where a street does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to the boundary than 50 feet. However, the Commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with city and/
or county construction standards and specifications available from the City
and/or County Engineer's office. For greater convenience to traffic and more
effective police and fire protection, residential cul-de-sacs streets shall
generally be limited to 600 feet in length. Maximum length for industrial and
other cul-de-sac streets may exceed 600 feet subject to the approval of the
Commission.
      (3)   Underground utilities shall not be placed under a dedicated
roadway, nor a roadway built over underground utility lines. Where it is
necessary for underground utility lines to cross under a roadway, the crossing
shall be perpendicular to the roadway.
   (L)   Design standards.
      (1)   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access for police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and
street maintenance equipment, and to coordinate street location in order to
achieve a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties,
the following design standards for streets are hereby required. (Street
classifications may be indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan
or on the official map; otherwise, they shall be determined by the Commission.)
      (2)   Street surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and
gutters and shall surface or cause the roadways to be surfaced to the widths
prescribed in these regulations. The surfacing shall be of a character as is
suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in
the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as determined by the City
and/or County Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains
and bridges. All street pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structures, curbs, turn-arounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction
standards and specifications adopted by the Commission, City and/or County
Engineer and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be
submitted by the developer for plat approval. The surface layer of asphalt on a
street in a new development does not have to be completed until 70% buildout of
the project, or one year after the start of the project, whichever is sooner.
      (3)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designed in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide for adequate and stable earth slopes.
The slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (4)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
         (a)   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
other than earth berms, walls, fences and other landscape screening devices
approved by the Commission is prohibited."
         (b)   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad
shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure a
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (c)   Streets parallel to a railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. The distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (5)   Intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. No street shall intersect a major street at an angle
of less than 70 degrees. An oblique street should be approximately at right
angles for at least 100 feet from an intersection. Not more than two streets
shall intersect at any one point.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of the street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has
separated, dual drives, without median breaks at either intersection. Where
local streets intersect with arterials, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersections of arterials shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (c)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two streets shall be
at least 20 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a
block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering
practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
         (d)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% grade at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
         (e)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut the ground and/or vegetation
(including trimming trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-
of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the City and/or County Engineer to
provide an adequate sight distance.
         (f)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% maximum and 2% minimum.
      (6)   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant
without reimbursement from the city and/or county. The sharing of expense for
the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as
determined by the Commission, will be fixed by special agreement between the
city and/or county and the applicant. The cost shall be charged to the
applicant pro-rata as the percentage of his or her land developed and so
served.
      (7)   Residential driveways. Residential driveways shall have a minimum
throat width of 12 feet and a maximum of 24 feet at the right-of-way. The drive
approach shall have a five foot flare or regular five-foot radius. All
driveways must be paved and shall conform to the city's design standards and
the portion of the driveway in the right-of-way must have a minimum six-inch
pavement depth.
      (8)   Commercial and industrial driveways. Commercial and industrial
driveways shall have a minimum throat width of 12 feet and a maximum of 24
feet, for entrance or exit only driveways. For two-way driveways, the minimum
throat width is 24 feet and the maximum is 36 feet at the right-of-way. The
drive approach shall have a minimum ten-foot radius. All driveways must be
paved and shall conform to the city's design standards, and the portion of the
driveway in the right-of-way must have a minimum six-inch pavement depth.
   (M)   Street dedications and reservations.
      (1)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision's
boundaries.
      (2)   Widening and realignment of existing streets.
         (a)   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when
the Comprehensive Plan, official map, Thoroughfare Plan or zoning setback
regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening of a street that would
require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be
required to improve and dedicate the streets at his or her own expense.
         (b)   The frontage streets and other streets on which subdivision lots
front shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own
expense to the full width required by these subdivision regulations. Land
reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying the yard or
area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.

§ 155.043 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block. The system must meet
the following standards:
      (1)   A storm water sewer system or a surface drainage system designed
for not less than a five-year storm frequency to serve the area being
subdivided shall be provided;
      (2)   When curbs and gutters are provided or when the Commission
determines the natural surface drainage to be inadequate, the subdivider shall
construct a storm water sewer system with inlets appropriately spaced in the
subdivision;
      (3)   A natural surface drainage system shall be permitted when curbs and
gutters are not provided, and the natural drainage will, in the opinion of the
Commission, adequately drain the storm water from the subdivision. The drainage
ways should be shallow swales sowed in grass rather than deep, open ditches.
Streets not having curb and gutter shall provide the following:
         (a)   Side ditch swales constructed at one foot (vertical) to three
feet (horizontal);
         (b)   A swale or culvert at all driveways sized according to the
amount of storm water flow;
         (c)   Culverts under the roadway where necessary: the size of culverts
will be according to the amount of storm water flow, but will not be less than
12 inches in diameter; and
         (d)   Relief of side ditches and swales along the roadway through the
use of off-street detention basins or existing drainage channels. Detention
basins may be required to avoid overloading channels and ditches.
      (4)   When topsoil has been removed from the surface of a lot on a slope
where erosion will cause a displacement of loose materials, the subdivider
shall utilize approved methods to prevent the wash from damaging adjacent
property, accumulating on street surfaces, or blocking drainageways; and
      (5)   In the design of a storm water sewer system for a subdivision, the
present and future expected runoff from the larger drainage area shall be
considered. For this reason, it may be desirable that larger sewers than those
needed to service the immediate subdivision be installed, if this occurs, the
Commission may recommend that the public utility join with the subdivider in
the installation of the sewer system.
   (B)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
prior to, or as result of the subdivision. The drainage facilities shall be
located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the city's and/or county's construction standards and
specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer. However, in subdivisions
containing lots of less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivision and be conducted to an approved outfall. Inspection
of facilities shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by the public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Cost provision(s)
for the connections) shall be incorporated by inclusion in the amount of the
performance bond or equivalent required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The City and/or County Engineer shall determine the necessary size
of the facility, based on the provisions of the required construction standards
and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The City and/or County
Engineer shall determine the effect of each proposed subdivision on existing
drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City and/or county
drainage studies together with other studies as may be available and
appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is
anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the
Commission may withhold secondary approval of the subdivision until provision
(such as a storage facility) has been made for file improvement of the
potential condition in a sum as the Commission shall determine. No subdivision
shall be approved unless adequate drainage from it will be provided to an
adequate drainage water course or facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the flood plain but
contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by
the Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of the
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above ponding levels.
      (6)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type construction
unless the Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will
be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (7)   Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the
flood plain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by
filling or obstruction, except as approved by the Natural Resources Commission
in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway.
See Figures
4-3 and
4-4 in division (B)(10) below.
      (8)   Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an
area of the flood plain designated as a floodway fringe, the Commission may
approve the subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated sufficiently to
be above the regulatory flood elevation; all lots for residential usage have a
flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where
provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by, flood water; and, approval to fill the area from the
Natural Resources Commission has been obtained in writing. Lands below the
regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement
for any lot. See Figures
4-3 and
4-4 in division (B)(10) below.
      (9)   Flood plain areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area
of the flood plain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not
been made, the Commission shall not approve such a subdivision unless all
streets are raised sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation; all
lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by flood water;
and, filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory
flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream.
All filling in the flood plain must be approved in writing by the State Natural
Resources Commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be
used for computing the area requirement for any lot.
      (10)   Recording of plats in the flood plain and floodway fringe. All
final plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that
of the regulatory flood elevation shall show and label the regulatory flood
boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final
plat for recording.

   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage course, drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided, granted or dedicated to the city and/
or county, conforming substantially to the lines of the watercourse, and of a
width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose of both
drainage and maintenance of the right-of-way. Wherever possible, it is
desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped
banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.

         (d)   In the case of hydrants that are intended to fail at the
groundline joint upon vehicle impact (traffic hydrant), specific care must be
taken to provide adequate soil resistance to avoid transmitting shock movement
to the lower barrel and inlet connection. In loose or poor load-bearing soil,
this may be accomplished by pouring a concrete collar approximately six inches
thick to a diameter of two feet at or near the groundline around the hydrant
barrel.
         (e)   Whether over or under water, surface water crossings present
special problems. The reviewing authority should be consulted before final

through 36 inches with maximum length of about 175 feet (53 m); jacking for
diameters 30 inches through 60 inches with lengths of about 200 feet (61 m);
and tunneling for pipes 48 inches and larger for longer lengths.
            2.   Carrier pipe.
               a.   The casing pipe should be six to eight inches (150-200 mm)
larger than the outside diameter of the ductile-iron pipe bells.
               b.   Carrier pipe may be pushed or pulled through the completed
casing pipe.
               c.   Chocks or skids should be placed under the carrier pipe to
ensure approximate centering within the casing pipe and to prevent damage
during installation.
               d.   Care must be exercised in order to avoid metal-to-metal
contact.
               e.   In order to avoid the transfer of earth and live loads to
the carrier pipe, the space between the carrier and casing pipes should not be
filled completely.
         (g)   Flushing:
            1.   Where dead-end mains occur, they shall be provided with a fire
hydrant if flow and pressure are sufficient, or with an approved flushing
hydrant or blow-off for flushing purposes.
               a.   Flushing devices should be sized to provide flows which
will give a velocity of at least two and one-half feet per second in the water
main being flushed.
               b.   No flushing device shall be directly connected to any
sewer.
            2.   Foreign material left in the pipelines during installation
often results in a valve or hydrant seat leaking during pressure tests.
               a.   Every effort should be made to keep lines clean during
installation.
               b.   Thorough flushing is recommended prior to a pressure test;
flushing should be accomplished by partially opening and closing valves and
hydrants several times under expected line pressure, with flow velocities
adequate to flush foreign material out of the valves and hydrants.
            3.   Chambers, pits or manholes containing valves, blow-offs,
meters or other appurtenances to a distribution system, shall not be connected
directly to any storm drain or sanitary sewer, nor shall blow-offs or air
relief valves be connected directly to any sewer. The chambers or pits shall be
drained to the surface of the ground where they are not subject to flooding by
surface water, or to absorption pits underground.
         (h)   Thrust restraint:
            1.   Hydrants. The bowl of each hydrant shall be well braced
against a sufficient area of un-excavated earth at the end of the trench with
stone slabs or concrete thrust blocks, or it shall be tied to the pipe with
suitable metal tie rods, clamps or restrained joints, as shown or directed by
the owner;
            2.   Fittings. All plugs, caps, tees, reducers and bends, unless
otherwise specified, shall be provided with thrust blocks or suitably
restrained joints, as shown or specified by the owner;
            3.   Design.
               a.   The design pressure is maximum pressure to which the
pipeline will be subjected, with consideration given to the vulnerability of
the pipe-soil system when the pressure is expected to be applied.
               b.   In most cases, this will be the test pressure of the pipe,
applied shortly after installation, when the pipe-soil system is normally most
vulnerable.
               c.   For buried pipelines, thrust restraint is achieved by
transferring the thrust force to the soil structure outside the pipe.
               d.   The objective of the design is to distribute the thrust
forces to the soil structure in such a manner that joint separation will not
occur in unrestrained joints.
            4.   Concrete thrust blocks.
               a.   Vertical and horizontal thrust blocks shall be made of
concrete having a compressive strength of not less than 2,000 psi (13.8 MPa)
after 28 days.
               b.   The blocks shall be placed between solid ground, and
fitting is to be anchored; the mass of the block and/or the area of bearing on
the pipe and on the ground in each instance shall be that shown or directed by
the owner.
               c.   The blocking shall, unless otherwise shown or directed, be
so located as to contain the resultant thrust force in such a way that the pipe
and fitting joints will be accessible for repair.
            5.   Restrained joints.
               a.   Restraining mechanisms for push-on or mechanical joints may
be used instead of concrete backing, if so indicated in the plans and
specifications.
               b.   Tie rods, clamps or other components of dissimilar metal
shall be protected against corrosion by hand application of a suitable coating
or by encasement of the entire assembly with eight mil (0.2 mm) loose
polyethylene film in accordance with ANSI/AWWA C105/A21.5.
         (i)   Service taps:
            1.   Tapping.
               a.   Corporation stops may be installed either before or after
pipe installation.
               b.   Generally, they are located at 10:00 or 2:00 on the
circumference of the pipe and may be screwed directly into the tapped and
treaded main without any additional appurtenances.
               c.   When more than one tap in an existing gray cast-iron pipe
is necessary to deliver the required flow, the taps should be staggered around
the circumference at least 12 inches (0.3 m) apart (not in a straight line).
               d.   Ductile-iron pipe in all classes may be directly tapped
with standard corporation stops; however, torque requirement for the
installation may be effectively reduced by the application of two layers of
three mil (0.1 mm) TFE tape to the male threads of the corporation stop.
               e.   Service taps on gray cast-iron and ductile-iron mains
encased in polyethylene may be accomplished by making an x-shaped cut in the
polyethylene and temporarily folding back the film or by tapping directly
through the polyethylene.
               f.   After the tap has been completed, cuts in the polyethylene
and any other areas of damage to the film shall be repaired with tape as
described in ANSI/AWWA C105/A21.5.
               g.   Service lines of dissimilar metals also shall be wrapped
with polyethylene or a suitable dielectric tape for a minimum clear distance of
three feet (0.9 m) away from the gray cast-iron or ductile-iron main.
            2.   Freezing. In this cold climate with deep frost penetration,
freezing of service lines can be a problem.
               a.   In the localities, installing corporation stops
horizontally at the 3:00 or 9:00 position on the pipe circumference will
conserve available cover over the service line or reduce the necessary depth of
bury on the main pipeline.
               b.   No service tap shall furnish water to two distance
premises.
            3.   Persons taking water must protect the service tap, lines and
main from freezing or damage.
         (j)   Hydrostatic testing; pressure and leakage test:
            1.   Test restrictions.
               a.   Test pressure shall not be less than one and one-quarter
times the working pressure at the highest point along the test section.
               b.   Test pressure shall not exceed pipe or thrust-restraint
design pressures.
               c.   The hydrostatic test shall be of at least two in duration.
               d.   Test pressure shall not vary by more than ± five psi (35
MPa or 0.35 bar) for the duration of the test.
               e.   Valves shall not be operated in either direction at
differential pressure exceeding the rated value working pressure.
               f.   Use of a test pressure greater than the rated valve
pressure can result in trapped test pressure between the gates of a double-disc
gate valve.
               g.   For tests at these pressures, the test setup should include
provision, independent of the valve, to reduce the line pressure to the rated
value pressure on completion of the test.
               h.   The valve can then be opened enough to equalize the trapped
pressure with the line pressure, or fully opened if desired.
               i.   Test pressure shall not exceed the rated pressure of the
valves when the pressure boundary of the test section includes closed,
resilient-seated gate valves or butterfly valves.
            2.   Pressurization.
               a.   After the pipe has been laid, all newly-laid pipe or any
valved section thereof shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of at least
one and one-half times the working pressure at the point of testing.
               b.   Each valve section of pipe shall be slowly filled with
water, and the specified test pressure, based on the elevation of the lowest
point of the line or section under test and corrected to the elevation of the
test gauge, shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in a
manner satisfactory to the owner.
               c.   Valves shall not be operated in either the opening or
closing direction at differential pressures above the rated pressure.
               d.   It is good practice to allow the system to stabilize at the
test pressure before conducting the leakage test.
            3.   Air removal. Before applying the specified test pressure, air
shall be expelled completely from the pipe, valves and hydrants.
               a.   If permanent air vents are not located at all high points,
the contractor shall install corporation cocks at the ports so that the air can
be expelled as the line is filled with water.
               b.   After all the air has been expelled, the corporation cocks
shall be closed and the test pressure applied.
               c.   At the conclusion the pressure test, the corporation cocks
shall be removed and plugged or left in place at the discretion of the owner.
            4.   Examination. Any exposed pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants and
joints shall be examined carefully during the test.
               a.   Any damaged or defective pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants
or joints that are discovered following the pressure test shall be repaired or
replaced with sound material.
               b.   The test shall be repeated until it is satisfactory to the
owner.
            5.   Leakage defined. LEAKAGE shall be defined as the quantity of
water that must be supplied into the newly laid: pipe or any valved section
thereof to maintain pressure within five psi (35 MPa or 0.35 bar) or the
specified test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and the air
has been expelled. Leakage shall not be measured by a drop in pressure in a
test section over a period of time.
            6.   Allowable leakage.
               a.   No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage is
greater than that determined by prevailing city standards.
               b.   When testing against closed metal-seated valves, an
additional leakage per closed valve of 0.0078 gph/inch (0.0012 L/h/mm) of
nominal valve size shall be allowed.
               c.   When hydrants are in the test section, the test shall be
made against closed hydrant valves.
            7.   Acceptance of installation
               a.   Acceptance shall be determined on the basis of allowable
leakage. If any test of laid pipe discloses leakage greater than that specified
in
Table 4-6, the contractor shall, at his or her own expense, locate and make
approved repairs as necessary until the leakage is within the specified
allowance.
               b.   All visible leaks are to be repaired, regardless of the
amount of leakage.
   (J)   Backfilling.
      (1)   All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse,
vegetable or organic material, boulders, rocks or stones, frozen soil or other
material that, in the opinion of the owner, is unsuitable.
      (2)   From one foot (300 mm) above the top of the pipe to the subgrade of
the pavement, material containing stones up to eight inches (200 mm) in their
greatest dimension may be used, unless otherwise specified.
      (3)   When the type of backfill material is not indicated on the plans or
is not specified, the excavated material may be used, provided that the
materials consist of loam, clay, sand, gravel or other materials that, in the
opinion of the owner, are suitable for backfilling.
      (4)   If excavated material is indicated on the drawings or specified for
backfill, and there is a deficiency due to rejection of a part thereof, the
required amount of sand, gravel or other approved material shall be provided.
      (5)   For purposes of definition:
         (a)   Sand is material graded from fine to coarse, containing less
than 10%, by weight, of loam and clay, that passes a three-inch sieve with no
more than 5%, by weight, remaining on a number four sieve.
         (b)   Gravel is a reasonably uniform combination containing no
boulders or stone larger than two inches (50 mm) and not containing excessive
amounts of clay and loam.
         (c)   Crushed stone is limestone or dolomite ledge-rock material that
all passes a one-half-inch sieve with no more than 25% passing a number 100
sieve.
      (6)   When special backfill compaction procedures are required, they
shall be accomplished in accordance with project specifications or applicable
federal, state and local regulations.
      (7)   Partial backfilling during testing:
         (a)   Newly installed pipelines are normally tested after backfilling;
and
         (b)   When unusual conditions require that pressure and leakage
testing be accomplished before completion of backfilling or with pipe joints
accessible for examination, sufficient backfill material shall be placed over
the pipe and soil, should be backfilled prior to testing.
      (8)   If polyethylene encasement is used, any damage that occurs to the
water main shall be repaired in accordance with ANSI/AWWA C105/A21.5.
   (K)   Disinfection.
      (1)   A newly installed main shall be disinfected in accordance with
ANSI/AWWA C651. Following chlorination, the main should be flushed as soon as
possible (within 24 hours), since prolonged exposure to high concentrations of
chlorine might damage the asphaltic seal coating.
      (2)   All new, cleaned or repaired water mains shall be disinfected in
accordance with AWWA Standard C601. The specifications shall include detailed
procedures for the adequate flushing, disinfection and microbiological testing
of all water mains.
   (L)   Cross-connections and interconnections.
      (1)   Cross-connections. There shall be no connection between the
distribution system and any pipes, pumps, hydrants or tanks whereby unsafe
water or other contaminating materials may be discharged or drawn into the
system.
      (2)   Cooling water. Neither stream condensate nor cooling water from
engine jackets or other heat exchange devices shall be returned to the potable
water supply.
      (3)   Interconnections. The approval of the reviewing authority shall be
obtained for interconnections between potable water supplies.
      (4)   Water services and plumbing.
         (a)   Plumbing. Water services and plumbing shall conform to relevant
local and/or state plumbing codes, or to the National Plumbing Code.
         (b)   Booster pumps. Individual booster pumps shall not be allowed for
any individual service from the public water supply mains.

reasonable times, and upon presentation of identification, for inspection of
the customer water system or testing of cross-connection control devices
installed in accordance with this rule (327 I.A.C. 8-10).
      (4)   Those customers granted an exemption in accordance with 327 I.A.C.
8-10-4(e) shall report to the commissioner and to the supplier of water any
proposed change in process, plumbing or in materials used or stored at the
exempted facility at least 14 days prior to making the change. The failure to
do so shall void the exemption.
   (S)   Inspectors, reports of inspection or test.

the results of inspections or tests conducted pursuant to 327 I.A.C. 8-10-8(b)
on air gaps, reduced pressure principle backflow preventers, double check valve
assemblies and pressure type vacuum breakers. Reports shall be submitted to the
supplier of water and to the customer within 30 days of the inspection or test.
   (T)   Non-compliance; retention of reports; access.
      (1)   Because cross-connections may cause disease through transmission of
contaminants via the public water supply, the commission shall order the
supplier of water to remove the customer service meter or otherwise sever the
public water supply connection to any customer which the commissioner finds or
has reason to believe is in violation of any provision of this rule (327 I.A.C.
8-10).

§ 155.045 SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. If, in the judgement of the Commission, a public
sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall install a
complete sanitary sewer system approved by the State Board of Health, including
a lateral connection for each lot in the subdivision.
   (B)   Sanitary sewerage system requirements. Where provided, sanitary
sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems, and
shall be installed to serve each lot to grades and sizes required by approving
officials and agencies. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including the
installation of laterals in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations and guidelines of the Health Officer,
participating jurisdiction and appropriate state agency.
   (C)   Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities
are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot
areas shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 156 of this code and any ordinance of any participating jurisdiction,
establishing lot areas for individual sewerage disposal systems. In this case,
sanitary wastes may be disposed of by one of the following methods:
      (1)   The subdivision may be provided with a complete sanitary sewer
system, including a lateral connection for each lot and a package treatment
plant, all meeting the approval of the State Board of Health and the State
Stream Pollution Control Board; or
      (2)   The subdivider may provide a private sewage disposal system on
individual lots consisting of a septic tank and soil absorption field or other
approved sewage disposal system, provided the disposal systems are totaled in
accordance with the minimum standards of the State Board of Health and provided
that the soil in the subdivision will properly absorb sewage effluent as
determined by soil studies and by percolation tests performed in accordance
with the procedure prescribed by the State Board of Health or as determined by
such other comparable tests approved by the Commission. Regardless of test
used, the following shall apply:
         (a)   An adequate number of tests, as determined by the Commission, to
clearly indicate the soil conditions throughout the subdivision shall be made
by the subdivider;
         (b)   The tests shall be performed by a licensed engineer, licensed
surveyor or qualified sanitarian;
         (c)   The location of each test shall be recorded on a map of the
subdivision, located on a drawing made to scale;
         (d)   The results of the tests shall be keyed to the map and certified
as being true, correct and performed according to the required procedure by the
person performing the tests; and
         (e)   No lot shall be used as a building site on which a percolation
test indicates a time of 60 minutes or more for the water to fall one inch.
   (D)   Selected design criteria.
      (1)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with a straight alignment
between manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Manhole location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each
line, and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 18 inches in
diameter and larger.
      (3)   Manholes. The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer
and the manhole invert shall not exceed 12 inches where required to match
crowns. The use of drop manholes requires approval by the City Engineer. The
minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall conform to those specified by the
City Engineer. Inside drop manholes will require special consideration;
however, in no case shall the minimum clear distance be less than that
indicated herein. The relationships between intersecting sewer lines shall meet
the standards required by the City Engineer. See division (D)(1) above.
      (4)   Sewerage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street
or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be provided to all manholes. Where
sewer lines in private easements cross public street or alley rights-of-way a
manhole shall be provided in the rights-of-way where possible. Imposed loading
shall be considered at all manhole locations. Not less than six feet of cover
shall be provided over the top of pipe in street and alley rights-of-way or
three feet in all other areas.
      (5)   Cleanouts. Cleanouts will not be permitted.
      (6)   Water supply interconnections. There shall be no physical
connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer
which will permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable
water system. Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other
water supply sources and structures.
      (7)   Relation of sewers to water mains. A minimum horizontal distance of
ten feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer lines. At points
where sewers cross water mains, the sewer shall be constructed of cast iron
pipe or encased in concrete for a distance of ten feet in each direction from
the crossing, measured perpendicular to the water line. This will not be
required when the water line is at least two feet above the sewer line.
   (E)   Sewer mains. If a sanitary sewer system is to be installed, it may be
desirable to install sewer mains of a larger size than needed to serve the
immediate subdivision. If this occurs, the Commission may recommend that the
public utility join with the subdivider in the installation of the sewer
system.
   (F)   Specifications for parts and materials.
      (1)   The sewage main shall be constructed of Schedule 40 Plastic,
equipped with slip joints with locking gaskets. The city must approve the main
before installation.
      (2)   The sewage main fittings shall be constructed of Schedule 40
Plastic, equipped with sip joints with locking gaskets. The city must approve
the fittings before installation.
      (3)   Manholes must be constructed of cement.
      (4)   Manhole casting specifications.
         (a)   Manhole frame C.I., Neenah 24 inches (5900-0007) or like,
approved by the city before installation.
         (b)   Manhole lids C.I., Neenah 24 inches (5900-0265) or like,
approved by the city before installation.
         (c)   Risers C.I., Neenah 24 inches, bolt ii rings, approved by the
city before installation.
      (5)   Sewage tapping saddles must have at least one strap that connects
it to the main, and it must keep the sewage service line out of the main sewage
line. They must be approved by the city before installation.
      (6)   There shall not be any connects to the sewage lines without the
permission of the city prior to starting. All connects that can be made through
a manhole should be done, but the permission of the city should be obtained
prior to starting.
      (7)   Handling and storage of materials.
         (a)   All piping, fittings, manholes, castings and accessories shall
be loaded and unloaded by lifting with hoists or skidding in order to avoid
shock or damage.
         (b)   Under no circumstances shall the material be dropped.
         (c)   Pipe handled on skidways shall not be rolled or skidded against
pipe on the ground.
         (d)   Slings, hooks or pipe tongs shall be padded and used to prevent

         (b)   Carrier pipe shall be pushed or pulled through the completed
casing pipe.
         (c)   Chocks or skids shall be placed beneath the carrier pipe in
order to prevent metal-to-metal contact and to help center the carrier pipe
inside of the casing.
         (d)   To avoid transferring earth and live loads to the carrier pipe,
the space between the carrier and the casing pipes shall not be completely
filled.
      (4)   Service taps will be allowed only with the use of a saddle so that
the service line does not intrude on the inner diameter of the pipe.
   (J)   Backfilling.
      (1)   All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse,
vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks, stones, frozen soil or other
material that in the opinion of the owner is unsuitable.
      (2)   From one foot above the top of the pipe to the subgrade of the
pavement, material containing stones up to six inches in diameter in the
greatest dimension may be used.
      (3)   When the type of backfill is not specified tn the plans, the
excavated material may be used if it meets the criteria of these
specifications.
      (4)   If excavated material is used as the backfill and there is a
deficiency due to rejection of a part thereof, the required amount of sand,
gravel or other approved material shall be provided.
      (5)   Compaction shall be completed in ten-inch lifts to provide proper
compaction rates and to avoid problems that result from improper backfill

§ 155.047 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location.
      (1)   All utility lines, deluding but not limited to gas, electric power,
telephone and CATV cables shall be located underground throughout the
subdivision.
      (2)   Wherever existing lines are located above ground, except on public
roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground.
      (3)   All utility lines and other facilities existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat or sketch
plan in the case of a minor subdivision.
      (4)   Underground service connections to the street property line of each
platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense.
      (5)   At the discretion of the Commission, the requirements for service

retained in single ownership intended to be developed for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Location of utility line easements shall be provided along the rear
or side lot lines as necessary for utility lines. Easements shall give access
for every lot, park or public grounds. Those easements shall be a minimum of 14
feet, and preferably 20 feet. Half of the total comes from each lot line.
Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the
applicable utility companies for the coordination of utility easements with
those established in adjoining properties.
      (2)   All easements shall be indicated on preliminary and final plats.
      (3)   Recommendations on the proposed layout of telephone and electric

the placement of utility lines underground, following the required standards
and specifications established by each utility company.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.048 PUBLIC USES.
   (A)   Parks, playgrounds and recreation areas.
      (1)   Recreation standards. The Commission may require that land be
reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreational purposes in locations
designated on the Comprehensive Plan or otherwise where the reservations would
be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography and general character and shall have adequate road access for the
particular purposes envisioned by the Commission. The area shall be shown and
marked on the plat: "Reserved for Park and/or Recreational Purposes". When
recreation areas are required, the Commission may determine the number of acres
to be reserved from the
Table 4-8 in division (A)(1)(a) below, which has been prepared on the basis of
providing four acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling units. The
Commission may refer the proposed reservations to the local government official
or agency in charge of parks and recreation for recommendation. If approved by
the official or agency, the developer shall either dedicate all the recreation
areas to the local government or shall provide in restrictive covenants of each
lot, as a condition of secondary approval.
         (a)   Recreation requirements. Recreation requirements are shown in
Table 4-8 below.
Table 4-8. Recreation Requirements
Single-Family Lots; Size of Lot Percentage of Total Land in Subdivision to be
                                Reserved for Recreation Purposes
Table 4-8. Recreation Requirements
Single-Family Lots; Size of Lot Percentage of Total Land in Subdivision to be
                                Reserved for Recreation Purposes
80,000 and greater SF           1.5%
50,000 SF                       2.5%
40,000 SF                       3.0%
35,000 SF                       3.5%
25,000 SF                       5.0%
15,000 SF                       8.0%
 
         (b)   Minimum size of park and playground reservations. In general,
land reserved for recreation purposes shall have an area of at least four
acres. When the percentages from
Table 4-8 above would create less than four acres, the Commission may require
that the recreation area be located in a suitable place on the edge of the
subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as the adjacent
land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than two acres be reserved
for recreational purposes where it is impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area. When recreational land in any
subdivision is not reserved, or land reserved is less than the percentage
indicated in division (A)(1) above, the provisions of division (A)(4) below
shall be applicable.
      (2)   Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a character and location suitable for use as playground, play field or other
active recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry. It shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Commission and the
cost of the improvements shall be included in the amount of the performance
bond. Passive recreation areas along stream valleys may be accepted by the
Commission as part of the required area if adequate flat land is also provided
for space-consuming recreation activities. A recreation site shall have a total
frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet, and no part of the site
shall be narrower or shallower than 200 feet except for stream-valley and other
linear passive recreation areas which shall at no point be narrower than 50
feet. The Commission may refer any subdivision intended to contain a dedicated
park to the local government official, department or agency in charge of parks
and recreation for a recommendation. All land to be reserved by dedication or
restrictive covenant to the city for park purposes shall have prior approval of
the city and shall be shown on the plat as "Reserved for Park and/or Recreation
Purposes."
      (3)   Applicability to land using average density provisions. Any
subdivision plat in which the principle of flexible zoning has been used shall
not be exempt from the provisions of this section except as to any portion of
the land area which is actually dedicated to the city for park and recreation
purposes.
      (4)   Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the preceding sections of this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation
purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Other public uses.
      (1)   Plat to provide for public uses. Whenever a tract to be subdivided
includes a school, recreation areas (in excess of the requirements of division
(A) above) or other public uses as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan or any
portion thereof, the space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into
his or her sketch plan, except when an applicant uses planned unit development
procedures in which land is set aside by the developer for public use as
required under those procedures in
Chapter 156 of this code. After proper determination of its necessity by the
Commission and the appropriate city official or other public agency involved in
the acquisition and use of each such site and a determination has been made to
acquire the site by the public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated
by the applicant into the preliminary and final plats. Upon such a
determination by the Commission, the following shall apply:
         (a)   Referral to public agency. The Commission shall refer the sketch
plan to the public agency concerned with acquisition for its consideration and
report. The Commission may propose alternate areas for the acquisition and
shall allow the public agency 30 days for reply. The public agency's
recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and
area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time within five years
required to complete the acquisition; and
         (b)   Notice to property owner. Upon a receipt of an affirmative
report, the Commission shall notify the property owner and the Administrator
shall designate on the preliminary and final plats each area proposed to be
acquired by a public agency.
      (2)   Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within five years of
notification in writing from the owner that he or she intends to develop the
land. The letter of intent shall be accompanied by a site plan of the proposed
development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of a
public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed five years shall
result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved
and the freeing of the property for development in accordance with these
regulations.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.049 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (A)   General. Existing features which would add value to the type of
intended development or to the city as a whole, such as trees, watercourses
falls, beaches, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
subdivision nor any change of grade of the land effected until primary approval
of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat which are
required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees, where needed, shall
be welled and protected against change of grade. The sketch plan shall show the
number and location of existing trees, as required by these regulations, and
shall indicate all those marked for retention and the location of all proposed
shade trees required along the street side(s) of each lot as required by these
regulations.
   (B)   Shade trees planted by developer.
      (1)   As a requirement for subdivision secondary approval, the applicant
shall plant trees on the property of the subdivision. The trees are to be
planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the street or streets within
and abutting the subdivision, or at the discretion of the Commission and the
City and/or County Engineer, within the right-of-way of the streets. One tree
shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each street unless the
Commission, upon recommendation of the City and/or County Engineer, shall grant
a waiver in accordance with §
155.013 above. The waiver shall be granted only if there are existing trees
growing along such a right-of-way or on the abutting property which in the
opinion of the Commission comply with these regulations.
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall be
approved by the City and/or County Engineer and shall be planted in accordance
with the regulations of the City and/or County Engineer. Those trees have a
minimum trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above ground level) of not less than
two inches. Only Oak, Honey Locust, Hard Maples, Ginkgo or other long-lived
shade trees acceptable to the City and/or County Engineer and to the
Commission, shall be planted.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.050 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to the land shall meet the special provisions as the Commission finds
appropriate and requires.
      (2)   A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the
requirements set forth in
Chapter 156 of this code. Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision
plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the
requirements of these regulations as well as such additional standards required
by the Commission and shall conform to the proposed land use standards
established in the Comprehensive Plan, official map and Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code), except that where lot lines are to be established
incrementally they need not be shown on the sketch plan or the preliminary plat
for final approval.
      (4)   All shopping centers and other nonresidential subdivisions of
buildings for leasehold shall be subject to the relevant provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Standards.
      (1)   In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations
which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the street, parcel and
block pattern proposed are appropriate for the uses anticipated and adequately
take into account other uses in the vicinity.
      (2)   The following principles and standards shall be observed:
         (a)   Proposed commercial or industrial parcels shall be suitable in
minimum area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Proposals for incremental lot by lot subdivisions must be clear in a statement
on the preliminary plat which is satisfactory to the Commission;
         (b)   Street rights-of-way and pavement construction shall be adequate
to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated
thereupon;
         (c)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission upon
recommendation of the city or county, with respect to street, curb, gutter and
sidewalk design and construction;
         (d)   Special requirements may be imposed by the Commission with
respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and
storm water drainage and pre-processing of sewage. Special requirements may
also be imposed regarding the storage and disposal of toxic materials;
         (e)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing onto existing or
potential residential development and provision of a permanently landscaped
buffer strip where necessary; and
         (f)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck
traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing
or potential residential areas.

ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 155.065 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
designated officials, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the City
and/or County Engineer, all the streets, sanitary and other public improvements
including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivisions as
required by this chapter, specified in the approved construction plans and on
the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission and to dedicate
the public improvements to the city and/or county, free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated.
   (B)   Performance bond.
      (1)   The Commission, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirement
that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the approval of
the final subdivision plat or section thereof. In lieu thereof, the applicant
shall post bond securable to the city, hereinafter referred to as performance
bond, in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of
the required public improvements. This amount of bond shall be sufficient to
secure to the participating jurisdiction the satisfactory construction and
installation of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements, as
provided for in §§
155.027(G)(1)(a) and
155.028(A)(1) above.
      (2)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certified check
made payable to the city in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost
of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for in §§
155.027(G)(1)(a) and
155.028(A)(1) above. Any such check shall be held by the City Clerk-Treasurer.
      (3)   In lieu of such a bond the subdivider may submit irrevocable
letters of credit on behalf of the subdivider and securable by the city in an
amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the
uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided in §§
155.027(G)(1)(a) and
155.028(A)(1) above. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is used, it
shall be written for a maximum length of two years. The Commission, two months
prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall determine if the public
improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the city or other units of
government having jurisdiction over them, and if they have not been accepted
shall so notify the subdivider of the city's intent to secure the funds pledged
by such a letter of credit or, at the discretion of the Commission, to grant an
extension of the original period fixed by the Commission. No extension shall
exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with the Commission a new letter of
credit for the period so extended.
      (4)   In lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of
deposit made out to either the city and the subdivider to be held by the County
Auditor or City Clerk-Treasurer, in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of
completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as
provided for §§
155.027(G)(1)(a) and
155.028(A)(1) above. The subdivider must endorse the certificate of deposit
before submitting it to the Commission that the city may secure the funds.
      (5)   A performance bond furnished pursuant to this chapter shall comply
with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the Commission
Attorney as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth in this
chapter. The period within which required public improvements must be completed
shall be specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the preliminary
plat and shall be incorporated into the bond and shall not in any event exceed
two years from date of secondary approval. The bond shall be approved by the
participating jurisdiction as to amount. The Commission may, upon proof of
difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in the bond for
a maximum period of one additional year, provided that the bond submitted for
this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The Commission may,
at any time during the term of the bond, accept a substitution of principal or
sureties on the bond.
   (C)   Temporary public improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary public improvements required by the Commission (or as
requested by the participating jurisdiction) and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction of any temporary
public facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with the Commission a
separate suitable bond for temporary facilities. This bond shall insure that
the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed
within two years.
   (D)   Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be
made by the applicant at his or her expense without reimbursement by the
participating jurisdiction or any public improvement district therein, unless
sharing of expenses is agreed upon by the city (or other participating
jurisdiction, where applicable).
   (E)   Governmental units. Governmental units, to which these bond provisions
apply may file a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this section in lieu of the bond.
   (F)   Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the Commission in the primary approval of the
preliminary plat, or the sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and the required public improvements have not been
installed within the terms of the performance bond, the participating
jurisdiction, may thereupon request the city to declare the bond to be in
default and cause all public improvements to be installed according to final
plat approval regardless of the extent of the building development at the time
the bond is declared to be in default.
   (G)   Acceptance of dedication offers. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by
the city (or other participating jurisdiction) of any street, easement or park
shown on the plat. The Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect. The approval relates only to the real
property itself.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.066 INSPECTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General procedure.
      (1)   If the participating jurisdiction finds upon inspection per §§
155.027(G)(1)(a) and
155.028(A)(1) above that any of the improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the approved construction plans, the applicant shall be
responsible for completing the public improvements according to the plans.
      (2)   Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a
performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and
jointly liable for completing the public improvements according to
specifications.
   (B)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
      (1)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city (or other
participating jurisdiction) shall not accept required public improvements, nor
the Commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the city has
submitted to it a certificate stating that all required public improvements or
a pro rata part in case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed. The
applicant's engineer or surveyor shall provide the participating jurisdiction
with detailed "as built" construction plans of the public improvements,
indicating location, dimensions, materials and other information required by
the Commission or participating jurisdiction. Upon the certification, the city
(or other participating jurisdiction) shall thereafter accept the public
improvements for maintenance in accordance with the established procedures
unless the city has reliable information as to non-compliance with the plans
and specifications.
      (2)   Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of public improvements, but only by the amount
originally estimated for the completion of the public improvements.
(Ord. 615, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 155.067 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements on
the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks (where required) until acceptance of the public improvements by the
city (or other participating jurisdiction).
   (B)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
Commission, prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost of
all public improvements, and in a form satisfactory to the Commission Attorney.
The maintenance bond is provided to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required public improvements for a period of three years after the date of
their acceptance by the city (or other participating jurisdiction).

§ 155.068 ISSUANCE OF IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMITS.
   No improvement location permit shall be issued for the last 10% of lots in a
final subdivision plat or section thereof, or if 10% be less than two lots, for
the last two lots of a subdivision or section thereof, until all public
improvements required by the Commission for the plat with the exception of
sidewalks have been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the
participating jurisdiction.

   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the Zoning Ordinance

of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation or other provision of
law, those provisions which are more restrictive or impose higher standards
shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate
any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than the easement, covenant or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards
than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission in enforcing these regulations, and those private provisions are not
inconsistent with these regulations or determinations thereunder, then the
private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and
determinations made thereunder. Private provisions can only be enforced
privately unless a public agency such as the City Council or City Advisory Plan
Commission has been made a party to those agreements.
(Ord. 614, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 156.003 SAVING PROVISION.
   This chapter shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under,
or by virtue of, prior existing zoning ordinance, or as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting
the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of
the city under any section or provision existing at the time of the effective
date of this chapter, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any
person, firm or corporation, by lawful action of the city except as shall be
expressly provided for in this chapter.

§ 156.004 DEFINITIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to explain the meaning of terms used in the
text of this chapter as well as additional terms which Planning Commissions and
Zoning Administrators often have to deal with. By making these meanings
explicit, the risk of arbitrary administrative decisions through lack of
understanding is reduced and fair administration of the chapter is enhanced.
Those preparing applications will have their tasks made easier if the purposes,
processes and requirements of the ordinance are more clearly comprehended.
Common understanding of the chapter will facilitate adherence to it and the
accomplishment of the stated public purposes for all parties affected by the
chapter in regard to adherence to its provisions and to the means of amending
its text and maps. Definitions that are illustrated in bold capital letters are
those which are explicitly used by the zoning and/or subdivision ordinances.
Definitions that are illustrated in bold letters are those which may be used by
developers, planners or other similar planning documents. For definitions

DISTRICTS
§ 156.020 KINDS OF DISTRICTS; ESTABLISHMENT.
   The city and its jurisdictional area is divided into the following
districts:
   (A)   Agriculture Districts, designated A, are established to include
substantial areas where little or no urbanization has occurred or is likely to
occur in the near future and where the predominant use of land involves crop
production, raising livestock or similar farming.
   (B)   Conservancy Districts, designated CD, are established to protect
environmentally sensitive areas, as well as include areas for public parks and
recreation areas. No principal structures should be permitted for any use in a
conservancy district. These areas may be used for agriculture, conservation or
may be included in computation of residential lots, yards or other open spaces.
   (C)   Residence Districts 1, designated R1, are established to include areas
for low density single-family residences with a density of one dwelling unit or
less per gross acre if connected to public sewer, otherwise one dwelling unit
or less per two acres.
   (D)   Residence Districts 2, designated R2, are established to include areas
for medium density single-family residences with a density of four dwelling
units or less per gross acre, if connected to public sewer.
   (E)   Residence Districts 3, designated R3, are established to include areas
for relatively high density single-family, and two-family residential
development with a density of eight dwelling units or less per gross acre, if
connected to public sewer.
   (F)   Multi-family Districts, designated R4, are established to include
areas for high density, multi-family residential development. All structures
which contain three or more residential dwelling units are restricted to an R4
subdivision. The total density of an R4 development should never exceed a
density of eight dwelling units or less per acre, all R4 development must be
connected to public sewer.
   (G)   Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions, designated R5, are for
manufactured home park subdivisions, for the placement of Type II and Type III
manufactured homes, as herein defined with exclusive occupancy as residences.
Residential units that are classified as either a manufactured home Type II or
Type III, are restricted to an R5 subdivision.
   (H)   General Business Districts, designated GB, are established to include
areas that are appropriate for a variety or combination of businesses, services
and light industrial uses.
   (I)   Central Business District, designated CB, is established to include
the city's core business area.
   (J)   Light Industrial Districts, designated as I1, are established to
include areas in which goods are produced for direct consumption by consumers.
Light industrial uses typically involve final assembly of goods produced from
prepared materials, finished products or parts, or wholesale and/or storage
activities.
      (1)   These districts are intended for those industries which do not
create adverse impacts on surrounding land uses. The I1 district may serve as a
buffer between heavier industrial districts and business or residential
districts.
      (2)   Uses must conform with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations, including but not limited to air emissions, water
discharge and solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal. New
residential uses are not permitted in I1 zoning districts.
      (3)   The following uses are permitted in an I1 district:
         (a)   All uses permitted in a GB district; excluding adult businesses;
         (b)   Accessory building and use;

distribution of manufactured products, supplies and equipment, provided that
storage is within an enclosed building (excluding auto wrecking, junk and
salvage, automobile tires, scrap materials or storage of materials that are
flammable or explosive or that create hazardous or commonly recognized
offensive conditions);
         (m)   Tool and/or die shop;
         (n)   Utility service yard; and
         (o)   Welding shop.
   (K)   General Industrial Districts, designated I2, are established to
include areas for fabricating, manufacturing and processing industries where
the operation is enclosed within a building and conducted in such a manner that
no adverse impacts are created or emitted outside of the building(s).
      (1)   Uses must conform with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations including but not limited to air emissions, water
discharge and solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal.
      (2)   The following uses are permitted in an I2 district:
         (a)   All uses permitted in an I1 district;
         (b)   Accessory building and use;
         (c)   Brewing and distilling;

(Ord. 614, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 156.021 BOUNDARIES; IN GENERAL.
   (A)   The boundaries of the districts established by §
156.020 above are as shown on the zone map which is a part of this chapter, and
hereafter known as the official zoning map for the city.
      (1)   The official zoning map shall hereafter be kept in the custody of
the Administrator. Except as provided by §
156.022 below, the boundaries and the official zoning map shall be changed only
by amendment to the official zoning map.
      (2)   Upon the amendment, the city shall within five days of passage of
the amendment, certify a copy of the amendment to the Administrator, who shall
immediately change the official zoning map in accordance with the amendment.
The Administrator shall cause the official zoning map to show the ordinance
number and date of adoption of all the amending ordinances.
   (B)   When the exact boundaries of a district are uncertain, they shall be
determined by use of the scale of the zoning map.
   (C)   When the maps are caused to be changed by amendment the change shall
be to the center of any and all abutting rights-of-way.
   (D)   If the boundary line of a district divides a lot having frontage on a
street so that the front part of the lot lies in one district and the rest of
the lot lies in another, use requirements and restrictions that apply to the
front part of the lot apply to the entire lot.
(Ord. 614, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 156.022 BOUNDARIES; FLOOD PLAINS.
   (A)   Development in areas that lie within the regulatory flood plain
boundary must acquire prior approval from the State Department of Natural
Resources (DNR). Regulatory flood boundaries have been determined by the State
Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and are illustrated by the flood boundary and floodway map, Noble
County, Panel numbers 180186 0001-0001,180186 0001-0004 and 180186 0001-0005.
   (B)   Flood plains may be changed if the State Natural Resources Commission,
after investigating the land involved, determines: that the requested change
would not endanger the public welfare; and that the elevation of the land is at
or above the elevation of the regulatory flood. The determination shall be made
in writing upon the request of the applicant who shall provide the State
Natural Resources Commission with a scale drawing identifying the location,
dimensions and elevations related to the U.S.G.S. datum of the land.
   (C)   All buildings or structures permitted on lands within 100 feet of the
flood plain shall be required to comply with the flood protection grade as
established by the State Natural Resources Commission.
(Ord. 614, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 156.023 SUBDIVISIONS, CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS, PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS,
CONDOMINIUMS AND ZERO LOT LINE DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   The subdivision of land shall be pursuant to the requirements of the
Subdivision Ordinance and shall be permitted in the following districts: A, R1,
R2, R3, R4, R5, CB, GB, I1, I2 and I3. The intended principal use of each of
the proposed lots within a proposed subdivision shall govern the specific
district or districts appropriate to the land to be subdivided, as per §§

   (B)   However, the following classifications of subdivisions shall only be
permitted in R1, R2, R3, R4 or R5 districts: major subdivisions intended
entirely for residential use, and any portions of major subdivisions intended
for residential use.
   (C)   Planned developments shall be permitted as per §
156.086 below, in order to provide greater design flexibility, and to encourage
innovative land development techniques and a more efficient use of land, the
design and development of uses within these districts may be permitted to
deviate from the standards prescribed by §§
156.055 through
156.068 below, when a comprehensive development plan has been formally approved
by City Plan Commission and all checkpoint offices, boards and commissions for
the affected area.
   (D)   Subdivision regulations are governed by the city. Deviation from these
standards must be formally approved by both the City Advisory Plan Commission
and the City Council.

Property Law), cluster developments, zero lot line developments and all
developments of the minimum sizes specified in §
156.086, and larger shall be considered for zoning purposes to be planned
developments, and consequently shall be permitted only as approved by the City
Planning Commission as per §
156.086 of this chapter.

(Ord. 614, passed 2-22-1999)
§ 156.037 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   Within the districts established by this chapter or by amendments
that may later be adopted, there may exist:
         (a)   Nonconforming lots;
         (b)   Nonconforming structures;
         (c)   Nonconforming uses of land;
         (d)   Nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination; and
         (e)   Nonconforming characteristics of use.
      (2)   These were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
they are prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or
may be prohibited, regulated or restricted under future amendments hereto, it
is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconforming uses or structures
to continue until they are removed, abandoned or discontinued but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconforming uses or structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses which are
prohibited elsewhere in the same district. Note: Illegal uses existing at the
time this chapter is enacted shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.
      (3)   Whenever a nonconforming use or structure has been discontinued or
abandoned for a period of 12 months or more, the discontinuance shall be
considered as an intent to abandon the structure or use. Any future use of the
property shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to structures and
uses which become nonconforming due to any zoning reclassification, annexation
or other inclusion.
      (5)   An applicant or owner claiming the existence of a nonconforming use
or structure shall bear the burden of supplying the Administrator with adequate
documentation verifying that the use or structure is a legal nonconforming use
or structure.
   (B)   Incompatibly of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by
this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which
the use is located. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of
land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not
be extended, expanded or enlarged upon passage of this chapter.
   (C)   Avoidance of undue hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building or development on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter and upon which actual building construction has been carried on
diligently. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried on
diligently. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined as work done which is beyond
the preparation stage and into that stage where the changes or additions are
made permanent.
   (D)   Single nonconforming lots of record. Note: This section shall apply
only to single-family residences. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record after the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this chapter. The lots must be in separate ownership or
included in a subdivision of record in the office of the County Recorder at the
time of passage of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though the
lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lots
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lots are
located. Also, see §
156.057(C) below. Variances of requirements listed in §§
156.055 through
156.072 of this chapter, other than lot area or lot width shall be obtained
only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in §
156.113 below.
   (E)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter and
if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to
be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter and no portion of the
parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the
lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any
division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter.
   (F)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the time of adoption of this
chapter, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they
remain otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (2)   No nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (3)   If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or
abandoned for a period of 12 months or more (except when government action
impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of the land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land
is located; and
      (4)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land.
   (G)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not now be
built under the terms of this chapter, such structure may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50% of the fair
market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (H)   Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and land in
combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or if a structure
and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms
of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside the building.
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed.
      (4)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for 12 months or more, the structure
or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (5)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (I)   Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of
12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-
bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of
the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure and market value of
real estate, or nonconforming portion of the structure, whichever the case may
be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall
not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of the official. If a nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.

except in business and industrial districts.
      (2)   All parking areas must conform to the location requirements
prescribed in this chapter.
      (3)   Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the required
off-street parking in which case the required number of parking spaces shall be
not less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses
computed separately. This provision shall apply to a building having space
occupied by two or more uses.
      (4)   When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces
required by division (C) above results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking space.
      (5)   Every company car, truck, tractor and trailer normally stored at a
business site shall be provided with off-street parking space. The space shall
be in addition to the parking requirements of division (C) above.
   (E)   Off-site parking facilities. Required parking for a nonresidential
development may be located off-site under certain circumstances. Requests for
variances allowing the substitution of off-site for on-site parking must meet
the following requirements.
      (1)   The off-site parking shall be located so that it will adequately
serve the use for which it is intended. In making this determination the
following factors, among other things, shall be considered:
         (a)   Proximity of the off-site parking facilities;
         (b)   Ease of pedestrian access to the off-site parking facilities;
and
         (c)   The type of use the off-site parking facilities are intended to
serve, i.e. off-site parking may not be appropriate for high turnover uses such
as retail.
      (2)   A written agreement shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the City
Attorney and executed by all parties concerned assuring the continued
availability of off-site parking facilities for the use they are intended to
serve.
   (F)   Development standards. Each parking area shall comply with the
standards as hereinafter set forth.

         (b)   Driveways shall be arranged for the free flow of vehicles at all
times, and all maneuvering spaces and aisles shall be so designed that all
vehicles may exit from and enter into a public street by being driven in a
forward direction, except that residential and employee parking spaces may
back-in from alleys.
         (c)   Each required off-street parking space shall be designed so that
any motor vehicle may proceed to and from the space without requiring the
moving of any other vehicle or by passing other vehicle or by passing over any
other parking space, except where the parking area is limited to employees.
         (d)   On any parking area in any district, all paved portions of all
parking spaces and maneuvering aisles shall be set back five feet from any wall
of a building, and five feet from any private or public way, or any lot line of
any land in residential districts or used for residential purposes.
      (2)   Construction.
         (a)   All required parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, and driveways
except in A districts shall have a durable, dustless, all-weather surface, such

used for residential purposes.
         (b)   In any outdoor parking area, a landscaped open space having an
area of not less than 10% of the outdoor parking area on the lot shall be
provided. A minimum of one-half of the required landscaped open space shall be
located in the interior of the parking area and contain ornamental or shade
trees and/or shrubs and/or other appropriate plant materials to provide shade
and color easily visible when the lot is full of cars.
         (c)   Trees required by the provisions of this section shall be at
least two inches in diameter at a height of five feet at the time of planting
and shall be of a species characterized by rapid growth and by suitability and
hardiness for location in a parking lot. To the extent practicable, existing
trees shall be retained and used to satisfy the provisions of this division.
      (4)   Screening. Any parking area which abuts residential districts or
uses shall be screened from the residential districts or uses and any parking
area shall be screened from a public or private way in accordance with the
following requirements.

materials when planted, may be not less than two and one-half feet in height if
of a species or variety which shall attain the required height and width within
two years of planting. Height shall be measured from the finished grade.
         (c)   Width. Screening shall be in a strip of landscaped open space at
least five feet wide, and so located as not to impair visibility of or from
approaching traffic or create potential hazards for pedestrians.
         (d)   Maintenance. All required plant materials shall be maintained in
a healthy condition and whenever necessary replaced with new plant materials to
ensure continued compliance with screening requirements. All required fences
and walls shall be permanently maintained in good repair and presentable
appearance and whenever necessary they shall be repaired or replaced.
         (e)   Lighting. All artificial lighting used to illuminate a parking
area, maneuvering space or driveway shall be arranged and shielded so as to
prevent direct glare from the light sources into any public street or private
way or onto adjacent property.
         (f)   Earth berms. Where appropriate and recommended by the Design
Review Board, landscaped earth berms may be used to help in screening or
separating uses or for other useful purposes.
   (G)   Off-street loading. There shall be provided off-street loading berths
not less than the minimum requirements specified in this section in connection
with any building or structure which is to be erected or substantially altered,
and which requires the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by
trucks or similar vehicles.
      (1)   Location. All required off-street loading berths shall be located
on the same lot as the use to be served, and no portion of the vehicle shall
project into a street or alley. No permitted or required loading berth shall be
located within 25 feet of the nearest point of intersection of any two streets,
nor shall it be located in a required front yard, or side yard adjoining a
street. Some uses are also subject to §§

not, while so allocated, be used to satisfy the space requirements of any off-
street parking areas or portions thereof.
      (6)   Off-street loading space requirements. One off-street loading berth
shall be provided for every 10,000 square feet of gross floor area but no more
than a total of two spaces up to 40,000 square feet of gross floor area, one

building location, any change in type of use, or any change in access points.
   (G)   Approval of a final detailed plan shall expire after a period of five
years from the approved phasing of the preliminary plan unless the development
is 50% completed in terms of public improvements including streets, parks,
walkways, utility installations and sanitary sewers. Determination of the
amount of completion shall be made by the Plan Commission upon a recommendation

§ 156.112 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   There shall be no classes of cases or application therefor, nor any
particular situation in which this chapter authorizes either special
exceptions, contingent uses, conditional uses or use variances.
   (B)   The Advisory Board may approve a special use in a district subordinate
and in direct connection with primary use if, after a hearing under §
156.111(D) above, it makes findings of fact in writing, that:
      (1)   Section
156.035 above authorizes that special use in that district;
      (2)   The requirements and development standards for the requested
special use as prescribed by this chapter will be met; and
      (3)   Granting the special use will not subvert the general purposes
served by this chapter and will not, because of traffic generation, placement
of outdoor lighting, noise production or hours of operation, materially and
permanently injure other property or uses in the same zoning district and
vicinity.
   (C)   The Advisory Board may impose such reasonable conditions upon its
approval as it deems necessary to find that division (B)(3) above will be
served.
   (D)   The Advisory Board may permit or require the owner of the parcel of
property to make a written commitment concerning the use or development of the
parcel.
   (E)   The approval of a special use under division (B) above is unnecessary
for a use authorized by §
156.035 above if that use existed on the date this chapter, or pertinent
amendments to it, were passed. However, this section shall not authorize the
expansion of such a use if it involves the enlargement of a building, structure
or land area.
   (F)   A special use approved by the Advisory Board may not be expanded,
extended or enlarged unless reapproved by the Advisory Board under the
procedures set forth in this chapter for approving a special use.
   (G)   A special use, approved under division (B) above or authorized by
division (E) above ceases to be authorized and is void if that use is not
established within a 12-month period of the date the special use was approved,
or if that special use is discontinued at that site for a 12-month period
during which time it is not succeeded by the same specifically approved special
use.
   (H)   A special use may be terminated by the Advisory Board of Zoning
Appeals, upon filing of an application therefor by an interested person or the
Administrator, and upon a finding at a public hearing, with notice to the
property owner, that the terms of this chapter, or conditions of approval or
commitments have not been compiled with.
   (I)   For a special use to be eligible for a public hearing by the Advisory
Board under this section, an applicant must first receive a determination from
the Administrator that a special use is required for the intended use or for
the expansion, extension or enlargement of a use under division (F) above. The
Administrator shall file a report of determination (in a form presented by the
Advisory Board) with the Plan Commission which body shall determine how the
granting of the special use would affect the purposes served by this chapter in
furtherance of the Comprehensive Plan. Within 30 days; of the date on which it
received the application, the Commission shall report its determination to the
Advisory Board, for action by it as authorized by division (B) above. If the
Advisory Board grants the special use, it shall direct the applicant to apply
for an improvement location permit under §
156.125 below. If the application complies with this chapter and all other
applicable codes and ordinances, the Administrator shall issue the improvement
location permit for the approved special use.

§ 156.113 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Advisory Board may grant a variance from the development standards
(such as height, bulk, area) of this chapter if, after a public hearing, it
makes findings of fact in writing, that:
      (1)   The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the community;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in
the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; and
      (3)   The strict application of the terms of this chapter: is being
applied to some condition peculiar to the property involved that is not common
to other properties in the same zoning district; and will result in an unusual
and unnecessary hardship. This situation shall not be solely self-imposed, nor
be based on a perceived reduction of or restriction on economic gain.
   (B)   The Advisory Board may permit or require the owner of a parcel of
property to make written commitment concerning the use or development of that
parcel or may impose conditions upon that grant of variance.
   (C)   A variance granted by The Advisory Board shall run with the land until
such time as the use of the variance ends; or the property conforms with the
ordinance as written.
   (D)   Where an owner has failed to comply with any condition and/or
commitment permitted or required by the grant of variance, the Advisory Board
may authorize that action as it may deem appropriate to obtain compliance by
the owner with the condition or commitment of the grant, or with the terms of
this chapter in the same manner as if the variance had not been granted.
