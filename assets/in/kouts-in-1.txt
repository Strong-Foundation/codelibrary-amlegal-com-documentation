presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.

authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then such named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or

the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest

such error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.

not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
such section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. Such section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture,
or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice

subcontractors shall submit the required information (including the name,
address, and type of work for each of their first-tier subcontractors) to the

of work of the substitute subcontractor. The substitute subcontractor is
subject to all of the obligations of a subcontractor under this subchapter.

subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future town public works projects. A

certified payroll report utilizing the federal form now known as a WH-347,
which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted to the town within ten
calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or subcontractor
performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports
shall identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, for
example, journeyman electrician or apprentice electrician. In the event any
contractor or subcontractor uses independent contractors to perform work on the
project, such individual must be identified on the WH-347 form with the same
information as is required for employees.
   (B)   The town may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if
the bidder fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time
as such certified payroll reports are submitted. The town may also withhold
payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if the subcontractor fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified
payroll reports are submitted. The town shall not withhold payment to a bidder
for work performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who
have submitted their certified payroll reports, because one or more other
subcontractors failed to timely submit their certified payroll reports

§ 51.50 SHUT-OFF MECHANISM; BACKFLOW PROTECTION DEVISE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Responsibility. The Water Utility shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contaminants or
pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said
Water Utility, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required as defined
by the I.A.C., 327 I.A.C. 8-10, Rule 10 (at the customer's water service
connection; or, within the customer's private water system) for the safety of
the water system, the Water Utility shall give notice in writing by mail to
said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at
specific location(s) on their premises. The consumer shall install such
approved assembly(s) at the consumer's own expense; and failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain said
assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met.
   (B)   Water system requirements. The water system shall be considered made
up of two parts, the utility system and the customer system:
      (1)   The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system.
      (2)   The customer system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
   (C)   Compliance. No water service connection to any premises shall be
installed or maintained by the Water Utility unless the water supply is
protected as required by State of Indiana rules and regulations and this
chapter. Service of water to any premises may be discontinued by the Water
Utility if a backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter is not
installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection
exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or
defects are corrected.
   (D)   Cross-connections. In no case shall there be cross-connections between
the public water distribution system and a private water supply. Any cross-
connections with other sources of water shall be made in conformity with the
rules and regulations set forth in Title 327 Rule 10 327 I.A.C. 8-10. All
plumbing shall conform to state and town codes, which do not permit physical
connections between the public water supply and other water supplies, waste
lines, process solution lines, tanks, and the like, unless the property is
protected by approved backflow protection safety devices. A representative of
the Water Utility Worker will make periodic inspections of customer's piping to
establish violations and will report any violations to both the customer and
the proper authorities. The town will not assume responsibility for damage,
sickness or death arising from the existence of an improper cross-connection or
the use or failure of a cross-connection. The discovery of a noncomplying
installation shall lead to discontinuation of service.
   (E)   Right of entry. The properly authorized representatives of the Water
Utility shall have the right to enter upon the premises of the customer all
reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting cross- connections, protective
devices, atmospheric tank applications, booster pump vacuum breaker valves, and
general plumbing, as well as for the purpose of reading, inspecting, repairing,
or replacing the meter at the termination of the contract or discontinuation of
service. All representatives shall have proper credentials on their person at
all times.
   (F)   Installation of backflow prevention. An approved backflow prevention
assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system
at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served;
but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line
wherever the following conditions exist:
      (1)   In case of the premises having an auxiliary water supply which is
not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the Water Utility, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the
degree of hazard.
      (2)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public shall be protected
against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow
protection assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the utility system which have been subject to deterioration of quality.
      (3)   In the case of premises having (A) internal cross-connection that
cannot be permanently controlled or corrected, or (B) intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises are not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible
to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connection(s) exist, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention device in the service line or lines
where potential hazards could exist.
      (4)   In the case of the premises having an irrigation system buried
below ground for use as a sprinkling outlet, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow
protection device.
      (5)   In the case of the premises undergoing plumbing rehabilitation and
all new construction, residential and commercial, the public water system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow protection device.
   (G)   Type of protective assembly. The type of assembly required shall
depend upon the degree of hazard which exists, as follows:
      (1)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly.
      (2)   In the case of any premises where there is water or a substance
that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
double check valve assembly.
      (3)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous
to health such as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water
system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly.
      (4)   In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
      (5)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow assembly on each
service to the premises.
      (6)   In the case of any premises having a lawn irrigation system, the
public water system shall be protected by an approved pressure vacuum breaker
backflow prevention assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly.
      (7)   In the case of all new residential construction and any existing
residential structures requiring extensive plumbing rehabilitation, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an
approved dual check valve backflow device or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly.
   (H)   Approval of backflow prevention assembly. Any backflow prevention
assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the Water
Utility. The term APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY shall mean an assembly
that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established
by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) entitled AWWA C506-84 Standards
for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention
Devices. Said assembly shall meet the laboratory and field performance
specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic
Research (FCCC&HR) of the University of Southern California established by
Specifications of Backflow Prevention Assemblies-Section 10 of the most current
issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control. Final approval shall be
evidenced by a certificate of approval issued by an approved testing laboratory
certifying full compliance with the said AWWA standards and FCCC&HR
specifications.
   (I)   Exemptions. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
which do not meet the requirements of this section that were approved devices
for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have
been properly maintained, shall be excluded from the requirement of these rules
so long as the Water Utility is assured that they will satisfactorily protect
the distribution system. However, whenever the existing device is moved from
the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the
Water Utility finds that the assembly or maintenance constitutes a hazard to
health, the unit shall be replaced, at the consumer's expense, by an approved
backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirement of this section.
   (J)   Inspection of devices; time limits. To ensure that each cross-
connection control device required by this chapter is in working order, the
customer shall have each device inspected or tested (at the customer's expense)
by a certified backflow technician at the time of construction or installation,
and at the following intervals, in the following manner:
      (1)   Air-gaps shall be inspected at intervals not exceeding one year to
ensure that they continue to meet the requirements set forth.
      (2)   Reduced pressure principle backflow assemblies shall be tested at
intervals not exceeding six months to ensure that:
         (a)   Both check valves are drip-tight under all pressure
differentials;
         (b)   The pressure differential relief valve will maintain pressure in
the center chamber at least two pounds per square inch below that of the inlet
chamber.
      (3)   Double check valve assemblies shall be tested at intervals not

   (B)   The user fees for all users shall be prepared and billed monthly.
   (C)   The user fees may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the
properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such
billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (D)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates or charges

§ 52.07 CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED RETENTION FACILITY.
   (A)   For any user that has a qualified retention facility on the property
being charged pursuant to this chapter, the user is entitled to a credit to be
determined by the Storm Water Management Board. Procedures used to calculate
the credit and the factor for determining the impact of increased runoff volume
shall be prescribed and set by the Storm Water Management Board.
   (B)   Calculation of discharge from developed sites and stormwater
detention/retention basins, as well as stormwater runoff volumes from developed
and undeveloped sites, shall use methodology which is in accordance with
acceptable engineering practice. Peak discharge, hydrograph, flood routing and
runoff volume procedures used by the Soil Conservation Service, the Corps of
Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, among others, are considered
acceptable. Any credit given to a user shall reduce the amount of base units
attributable to such user, but no credit may reduce the initial base units by
more than 50%.
   (C)   Before such credit is granted, the user must establish that its
facility meets the definition of a qualified retention facility. In addition,
such credits shall be subject to an annual review by the Storm Water Management
Board to determine continuing compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

town employee or agent or other third party.
   (B)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway. In that case,
the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building
and the whole considered as one building sewer.
   (C)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, upon examination and testing by the Inspector to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   The building sewer shall be of:
      (1)   Polyvinyl Chloride Pipe (PVC): SDR 26.
      (2)   Other suitable material approved by the Town of Kouts.
   (E)   If a building sewer is laid within ten feet horizontally of a water
service pipe, the water main shall be in a separate trench or on an undisturbed
earth shelf on one side of the sewer and 18-inches clear above the sewer. If
the horizontal or vertical separations cannot be met, both the water main and

at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall. The depth shall be
sufficient to afford protection from frost but in no event shall it be less
than 42 inches. The building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade and in
straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only
with proper curved pipes and fittings.
   (H)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drains shall
be lifted by a means approved by the town in writing and discharged to the
building sewer.
   (I)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer

made at the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and a properly located “Y”
branch is not available, the owner shall, at his or her expense, install a “Y”
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the town. Where the
public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located “Y”
branch is available, a neat hole may be cut in the public sewer to receive the
building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45
degrees. A 45 degree elbow may be used to make such connection, with the spigot
end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The
invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be made at the
top one-quarter of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and
the connection made secure and water tight by resilient gaskets, epoxy cements
or encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only
when approved by the town. The final connection must be inspected and approved
by the town.

§ 53.04 SEWER USER CLASS.
   (A)   Every person whose premises are served by said sewage works shall be
charged for the service provided. These charges are established for each user
class, as defined, in order that the sewage works shall recover, from each user
and user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the treatment works
in terms of volume and load. User charges are levied to defray the cost of
operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works. User
charges shall be uniform in magnitude within a user class.
   (B)   (a)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published in the Federal Register
February 17,1984 (40 CFR 35.2140). Replacement costs, which are recovered
through the system of user charges, shall be based upon the expected useful
life of the sewage works equipment.
   (C)   The various classes of users of the treatment works for the purpose of
this chapter, shall be as follows:
      (1)   Class I      Residential
      (2)   Class II      Commercial
                  Governmental
                  Institutional
                  Industrial

§ 53.05 RATES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   For the use of the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate, or building that is connected with the town's sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of the
town.
   (B)   Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs,
excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determined as follows:
      (1)   General. The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the
quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates
and charges as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a
billing and collection charge per bill except as herein otherwise provided. For
the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the water
meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be billed each month (or
period equaling a month). The water usage schedule on which the amount of said
rates and charges shall be determined as is set forth in the remaining
subsections of this division.
      (2)   All Class I and Class II connections. A service connection charge
(tap-in fee) shall be paid before any sewer connection is completed. Before
such connection is made, a permit must be secured and 24 hours' notice given to
the town. All such connections shall be made and all such work done at the
expense of the applicant who shall also furnish materials necessary for such
work. All such connections shall be made under the supervision of the Town and
no connection shall be covered until the work has been inspected. Applications
for such connections shall be made to the town, and the permit fee paid. Such

§ 53.06 ADJUSTMENT OF RATES BASED ON WATER USAGE.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the town shall be
determined by the town in such manner as the town shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the town may make proper allowances in
determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be
consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the town that such
quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and the water used thereon or
therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rate or charge
provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a meter not acceptable to the town, then the amount of water used shall be
otherwise measured or determined by the town. In order to ascertain the rates
or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the town for the
determination of sewage discharge.
   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and
the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such
case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for
each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to
each of the number of residential lots, parcels or real estate or buildings
served through the single water meter.
   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the town's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that a minimum charge shall be billed monthly
per dwelling unit served through the single water meter ($23.35 effective upon
adoption, $30.44 effective June 1, 2018, $37.55 effective June 1,2019). In the
case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and
interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent plus
any other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided.
   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the town's
sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
town that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable
to the town for the determination of sewage discharge.

§ 53.07 ADJUSTMENT OF RATES BASED ON SEWAGE CONTENT.
   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to
the service rendered to users, the town shall base its charges not only on the
volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic
sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The town shall
require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes
discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in
such manner, by such method and at such times as the town may deem practicable
in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the proper change. The user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the town at all times.
   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a suspended
solids in excess of 150 milligrams per liter of fluid, biochemical oxygen
demand in excess of 150 milligrams per liter of fluid, or ammonia in excess of
20 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-
than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis.
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids.
         (a)   Effective upon adoption, there shall be an additional charge of
$0.68 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received in excess of
150 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (b)   Effective June 1, 2018, there shall be an additional charge of
$0.89 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received in excess of
150 milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (c)   Effective June 1, 2019, there shall be an additional charge of
$1.09 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received in excess of
150 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.
         (a)   Effective upon adoption, there shall be an additional charge of
$0.68 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 150
milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (b)   Effective June 1, 2018, there shall be an additional charge of
$0.89 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 150
milligrams per liter of fluid.
         (c)   Effective June 1, 2019, there shall be an additional charge of
$1.09 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 150
milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon ammonia.
         (a)   Effective upon adoption, there shall be an additional charge of
$1.68 per pound of ammonia for ammonia received in excess of 20 milligrams per
liter of fluid.
         (b)   Effective June 1, 2018, there shall be an additional charge of
$2.19 per pound of ammonia received in excess of 20 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
         (c)   Effective June 1, 2019, there shall be an additional charge of
$2.70 per pound of ammonia received in excess of 20 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
   (B)   The determination of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand and
ammonia contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
“Standard Methods for the Elimination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes,”
as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in accordance with
"Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants," 40 CFR
Part 136.

   (A)   The rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the
town in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (B)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed
monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the rates charged for
operation, maintenance and replacement for that user during the next year in
conjunction with a regular bill.
   (C)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying
the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners or properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the town for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (D)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid by the
fifteenth day of the month following receipt are declared to be delinquent and
a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates and charges shall thereupon attach
thereto. Collection procedures and court action may be initiated and all
delinquent bills remaining unpaid over 30 days after the due date regardless of
the assertion of a lien therefor.
   (E)   Any delinquency and penalty shall constitute a lien upon the real
estate for which such services apply, and the Clerk-Treasurer shall be and is
authorized to file a notice of lien showing such delinquencies in the office of
the Recorder of Porter County, Indiana. Nothing in this section mandates or
directs liens to be perfected in any particular case. All liens duly perfected
may be enforced by foreclosure pursuant to law, the town reserving all rights
thereunder and as amended.

the town. The specifications shall be in accordance with the Indiana Plumbing
Code and Town of Kouts Standards.
   (E)   When a discharger is required to provide preliminary treatment,
including interceptors or flow equalization facilities, such equipment shall be
maintained by the discharger in satisfactory operating condition as determined
by the town, at the owner’s expense.
   (F)   When required by the town, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the town. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense, and shall be
maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The
town, IDEM and EPA shall be permitted to enter all properties for such purposes
as inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.
   (G)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
wastewater to which reference is made in this chapter shall be conducted using
the methods and procedures in 40 CFR Part 136, and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the sewage
works to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect to
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. (The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always,
CBOD and T.S.S. analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH analyses are obtained from periodic grab samples.)
   (H)   No statement contained in this article shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength of character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial user, at such rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance,
provided, however, that no special agreement or arrangement may be made with
the town which results in the violation of National Pretreatment Standards or
local limits.

permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any
commercial advertising.

prohibited between certain hours of any day and permitted at other hours, in
which event the same shall be plainly indicated on the signs, or they may be
removed when such turns are permitted.
      (2)   Whenever authorized signs are erected indicating that no right or
left or U-turn is permitted, no driver of a vehicle shall disobey the
directions of any such sign.
   (K)   Limitations on turning around. The driver of any vehicle shall not

periods. The Town Marshal is authorized to determine and designate streets,
parts of streets or specific lanes thereon upon which vehicular traffic shall

erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center line of the roadway.

vehicle in violation of such markings, signs, barriers or other devices so
placed in accordance with this section.
(`77 Code, § 30.03) Penalty, see §

§ 70.04 SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Those streets and parts of streets as hereafter set out are declared
to be through streets for the purpose of this section.
   (B)   Whenever any ordinance of this town designates and describes a through
street, it shall be the duty of the Town Marshal to place and maintain a stop
sign on each and every street intersecting such through street or intersection,
that portion thereof described and designated as such by any ordinance of this
town, unless traffic at any such intersection is controlled at all times by
traffic control signals; provided, however, that at the intersection of two
such through streets or at the intersection of a through street and a heavy
traffic street not so designated, stop signs shall be erected at the approaches
of either or both of said streets as may be determined by the Town Marshal upon
the basis of an engineering and traffic study.
   (C)   The Town Marshal is authorized to determine and designate
intersections where particular hazards exist upon other than through streets
and may designate any such intersection as a stop intersection or a yield
intersection and erect stop signs or yield signs at one or more entrances to
such intersections.
   (D)   (1)   Every stop sign and every yield sign shall be located as near as
practicable at the nearest line of the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection or, if none, at the nearest line of the roadway.
      (2)   In residence and business districts, and at any place where parked
vehicles may frequently obscure the stop or yield signs, the signs shall be
mounted so that their lower edge will be seven feet above the top of the curb.
The left edge of the sign shall be not less than one foot nor more than three
feet back from the face of the curb. Where there is a marked crosswalk on the
pavement, the sign shall be erected four feet in advance of the crosswalk line,
nearest to approaching traffic.
   (E)   (1)   When stop signs are erected as herein authorized, at or near the
entrance to any intersection, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection,
or in the event there is no crosswalk, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
entering the intersection, except when directed to proceed by a policy officer
or traffic control signal.
      (2)   After the driver of a vehicle has stopped at the entrance to a
through highway, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles
which have entered the intersection from the through highway or which are
approaching so closely on said through highway as to constitute an immediate
hazard, but the driver having so yielded may proceed and the driver of all
other vehicles approaching the intersection on the through highway shall yield
the right-of-way to the vehicle so proceeding into or across the through
highway.
      (3)   After the driver of a vehicle has stopped in obedience to a stop
sign at an intersection where a stop sign is erected at one or more entrances
thereto, although not a part of a through highway, the driver shall proceed
cautiously, yielding to vehicles not so obliged to stop, which are within the
intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard,
but may then proceed.
   (F)   (1)   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in
obedience to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing
conditions or shall stop if necessary and shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard. The driver having so yielded and having stopped
in order to so yield may then proceed, and the drivers of all other vehicles
approaching the intersection on intersecting roadways shall yield to the
vehicle so proceeding. A driver who enters a yield intersection without
stopping and who has or causes a collision with a vehicle which entered the
intersection from an intersecting roadway shall prima facie be considered not
to have yielded as required herein. The foregoing shall not relieve the drivers
of other vehicles approaching the intersection at such distance as not to
constitute an immediate hazard from the duty to drive with due care to avoid a
collision.
      (2)   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign, if required for
safety to stop, shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, in the event there is no crosswalk, at a clearly marked
stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway.
   (G)   (1)   The driver of a vehicle, within a business or residence
district, emerging from an alley, driveway or building, shall stop such vehicle
immediately prior to driving onto a sidewalk or onto the sidewalk area
extending across any alleyway yielding the right-of-way to any pedestrians as
may be necessary to avoid collision and upon entering the roadway shall yield
the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway.
      (2)   No driver shall enter an intersection or a marked crosswalk unless
there is sufficient space on the other side of the intersection or crosswalk to
accommodate the vehicle he or she is operating, without obstructing the passage
of other vehicles or pedestrians, notwithstanding any traffic-control signal
indication to proceed.
(`77 Code, § 30.04)
§ 70.05 TRUCK ROUTES.
   All streets and alleys of the town, with the exception of State Road 8 and
State Road 49, shall be designated as restricted streets. It shall be unlawful
for the driver of any truck or truck-tractor to drive upon the same except for
the purpose of making a delivery or carrying on business in the block in which
such vehicle is being driven, except trucks of less than 26,000 pounds. Any
driver making a delivery shall enter the restricted streets at the first
intersection nearest the point of delivery and leave same in the first

§ 111.07 RIGHT OF INJUNCTION.
   The Building Commissioner or his or her designated representative may
institute a suit for injunction in an appropriate court to restrain an
individual from violating the provisions of this chapter and may also institute
a suit for a mandatory injunction directing the removal of any structure or
improvement. Such remedy shall be in addition to other remedies, fines and
enforcement set forth in this chapter or any other ordinance.
(`77 Code, § 67.16) (Am. Ord. 1999-1, passed 1-21-99)
§ 111.08 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   In order to determine if any communications facility or structure is
unlawfully erected, altered or maintained, the Building Commissioner or any
officer of the town may enter onto that property to investigate the matter and
may take appropriate action to bring such communications facility or structure
into compliance. However, before action to bring such communications facility
or structure into compliance may be taken, all persons holding a substantial
interest in the communications facility or structure, as identified by §
111.20, must be notified and given a reasonable opportunity to bring the
facility or structure into compliance, except that the town may, without such
notice, take any steps necessary to alleviate immediate public danger. The
town’s cost for any work done on the site may be recouped from any person
chargeable with the violation or from the surety or deposit made pursuant to §

§ 130.02 IDLING AND LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarms for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property
utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free
passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person
to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open
to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

street which is being maintained under the full and complete control and
municipal authority of the Town of Kouts, State of Indiana, Porter County
Highway Department, or, a private street that has a dedicated and recorded
ingress and egress easement, the terms of which have been reviewed and approved
by the Plan Commission. No site will be considered as meeting the requirements
set forth in this section if its partition or division from an existing site
leaves the original site or any other developed site, lot or parcel in conflict

regulations or other ordinances. No building permit shall be issued unless the
site to be occupied is served with an adequate supply of potable water to meet
requirements of the proposed development or construction.

development, when, in its best judgment and determination, such construction or
development of the area would endanger the public health and safety or
unreasonably increase the public hazards. No permit shall be issued by the
Building Inspector for any such construction in the area while such resolution
remains in full force and effect.
   (E)   No building permit will be issued over any site, parcel of land, or

§ 151.31 REPAIRS, PUBLIC BIDS FOR WORK PURSUANT TO ORDER.

151.25 has been made on each person having a substantial property interest in
the unsafe premises which are the subject of the order;
      (3)   Each of the orders has been affirmed or modified at a hearing in
such manner that all persons having a substantial property interest in the
unsafe premises which are the subject of each of the orders are currently
subject to an order requiring the accomplishment of substantially identical
actions;
      (4)   The order affirmed or modified at the hearing has not been complied
with, or having once been complied with, is not being complied with; and

151.27.
   (B)   (1)   This work may be performed in the following manner:
         (a)   If the cost is estimated to be less than $5,000, the Enforcement
Authority acting in conjunction with the Town Engineer as its agent or any
other governmental agency may perform the work by means of employees of the
town or its designees and equipment owned and leased by it. Notice that this
work is to be performed shall be given to all persons with a substantial
interest in the manner provided in divisions (C) and (D) of this section. This
notice shall be given at least ten days before the date of performance of the
work. This notice shall include a statement that an amount representing a
reasonable estimate of the cost incurred in processing the matter and
performing the work may, if not paid, be recorded after a hearing as a lien
against all persons having a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable
interest as a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises.
         (b)   If the estimated cost of this work is $5,000 or more, this work
shall be let out at public bid to a contractor licensed and qualified under
law. The obligation to pay costs imposed by §
151.31 is based on the condition of the unsafe premises at the time the public
bid was accepted. Changes occurring in the condition of the unsafe premises
after the public bid was accepted shall not eliminate or diminish this
obligation;
      (2)   Bids may be solicited and accepted for work on more than one
property if the bid reflects an allocation of the bid amount among the various
unsafe premises in proportion to the work to be accomplished. The portion of
the bid amount attributable to each of the unsafe premises shall constitute the
basis for calculating the portion of the cost defined under §
151.31.
   (C)   All persons with a substantial property interest in the unsafe
premises shall be notified about the public bid in accordance with §
151.25 by means of written statement which shall include the following

accomplishes the work and an amount representing a reasonable estimate of the
cost incurred by the Enforcement Authority in processing the matter of unsafe
premises may, if not paid, be recorded after a hearing as a lien against all
persons having a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable interest of a
contract purchaser in the unsafe premises;
      (6)   The date and time of the bid opening;
      (7)   The place of the bid opening; and

work to be accomplished. The publication also shall include a statement that a
copy of the statement of public bid may be obtained from the Enforcement
Authority.
   (E)   Notice of statement that public bids are to be let shall be given to
all persons having a substantial property interest in the property at least ten
calendar days before the date of the public bid.
   (F)   Persons having a substantial property interest in the unsafe premises
which are the subject of a statement that public bids are to be let may, as
their interest allows, within a period of five calendar days after they have
received notice of such statement, elect by sending a statement in writing to
the Enforcement Authority to retain any or all of the materials resulting or
salvaged from such work. In the absence of such statement, the Enforcement
Authority may decide the method of disposal of such materials.
   (G)   If action in accordance with this section is being taken on the basis
of an order which is being served by publication, it shall be sufficient to
serve the statement that the Enforcement Authority acting in conjunction with
whoever intends to perform the work or that public bids are to be let by
publication unless the Plan Commission has received information in writing that
would enable it to make service in accordance with §
151.25 by a method other than publication.

§ 151.32 LIABILITY FOR COSTS OF WORK PURSUANT TO ORDER.
   (A)   When action required by an order is performed by the Enforcement
Authority acting by and through its agents, or by a contractor in accordance
with §
151.31, each person who held a fee interest, life estate interest or equitable
interest as a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises from the time when the
order requiring the work performed was recorded to the time that the work was
completed shall be jointly and severally responsible for the following costs:
      (1)   The actual cost of the work performed by the Plan Commission
through its designee or the bid price of work accomplished by the contractor in
accordance with §
151.31;
      (2)   An amount which represents a reasonable forecast of the average
processing expense which will be incurred by the Enforcement Authority in
taking all the technical, administrative and legal actions relative to a
typical unsafe premises which are necessary under this chapter so that the
action required by an order may be performed by a contractor in accordance with
§
151.31. In calculating the amount of the average processing expense, the
following costs may be considered:
         (a)   The cost of obtaining reliable information about the identity
and location of persons who own a substantial property interest in the unsafe
premises;
         (b)   The cost of notice of order, notice of statements of rescission,
notice of continued hearing and notice of statements that public bids are to be
let or that the Enforcement Authority acting by and through its agents intends
to accomplish the work and notice that a hearing may be held on the amounts
indicated in the records;
         (c)   Salaries for employees;
         (d)   Supplies, equipment and office space.
   (B)   The amount of such average processing expense shall be determined by
the Plan Commission at a public hearing relative to which notice has been given
in the same manner as is required for other official action of the Plan
Commission. In determining such average processing expense, it shall be
acceptable to fix the amount at a full dollar amount which is an even multiple
of ten.
   (C)   All or any part of the actual costs incurred by the Enforcement
Authority or the contractor bid price and the applicable average processing
expense remain unpaid relative to any unsafe premises other than unsafe
premises owned by a governmental entity after a period of 15 days has elapsed
after the completion of the work and the Enforcement Authority of the Plan
Commission at his or her discretion determines that there is a reasonable
probability of obtaining recovery, the Enforcement Authority shall prepare a
record which shall state the name or names and last known addresses of all
persons who have a fee interest or life estate interest in the unsafe premises
that were the subject of work, the nature of work that was accomplished, the
amount of the unpaid bid price of the work that was accomplished and the amount
of the unpaid average processing expense.
   (D)   This record shall be in the form prescribed by or approved by the
State Board of Accounts. The Enforcement Authority shall swear to the accuracy
of the record prepared by him or her before the Clerk of the Circuit Court and
shall thereon deposit the record in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court. Notice that the record has been filed and that a hearing on the amounts
indicated in the record may be held shall be sent to the person or persons
named in the record as provided in §
151.25.
   (E)   If, within 30 days after the notice required by I.C. 36-7-9-13(b), the
Clerk of the Circuit Court has received a written petition from the person
named in the record objecting to the claim for payment and requesting a
hearing, the Clerk of the Circuit Court shall enter the cause on the docket of
Circuit or Superior Court as a civil action and a fair hearing on the question
shall be held pursuant to the provisions of I.C. 4-21.5. However, issues that
could have been determined pursuant to §
151.27 shall not be entertained at the hearing. At the conclusion of the
hearing on the petition, the court shall either sustain the petition or enter a
judgment for the amounts recorded or modified amounts against the person or
persons named in the record. If no petition is received at the end of 30 days
after the notice to the person or persons named in the record, the Clerk of the
Circuit Court shall enter the cause on the docket of the court and the court
shall enter a judgment for the amounts stated in the record which shall
constitute a debt and be a lien on all the real and personal property of the
person named or the joint and severable debt and lien on the real and personal
property. The lien on real property is perfected as against all creditors and
purchasers when the judgment is entered on the judgment docket of the court.
The lien on the personal property shall be perfected by filing a lis pendens
notice in the appropriate filing office as prescribed by the Indiana Rules of
Trial Procedure. Any judgment rendered under this section may be enforced in
the same manner as all other judgments are enforced.

building is located and on the rents and income thereof and shall be superior
to all existing assignments of rents, liens, mortgages or other encumbrances on
the property except taxes, provided that within 60 days following the sale or
transfer for value of the notes by the receiver, the holder thereof shall file
notice in the Porter County Recorder’s office which shall contain the following

the date of default. The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees,
commission and necessary expenses as are receivers in actions to foreclose
mortgages and the fees, commission and expenses shall be paid out of the rents
and income of the property in receivership.

emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density greater than No. 2 on the
Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times, except as otherwise provided
hereinafter.
   (C)   The emission from all sources within any lot area of particulate
matter containing more than 5% by weight of particles having a particle
diameter larger than 44 microns is prohibited.
   (D)   Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads and so forth within lot boundaries shall
be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling or other
acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such sources in excess of
the weight limitations specified hereinafter for the zoning district in which
such use shall be located is prohibited. The Ringelmann Chart is adopted by
reference and three copies of the Chart are on file in the office of the Town
Clerk-Treasurer.

      (3)   Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate
matter within the lot boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
         (a)   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre;
         (b)   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in the above
item, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission;
         (c)   Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in the
above item to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of
emission within the boundaries of the lot; such total shall not exceed one
pound per acre of lot area during any one hour.
   (F)   In the General Industrial (G.I.) Zoning District, the following
additional regulations shall apply:
      (1)   The emission of more than 16 smoke units per stack in any 30 minute
period is prohibited, including smoke in excess of Ringelmann No. 2. However,
once during any two hour period, each stack shall be permitted up to 24 smoke
units (not to exceed Ringelmann No. 3) in 30 minutes for soot blowing and fire
cleaning.
      (2)   The rate of particulate matter emission from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of eight pounds per acre
during any one hour after deducting from the gross hourly emission per acre the
correction factor set forth in the following table:
 
Allowance for Height of Emission*

*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
      (3)   Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate
matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
         (a)   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre;
         (b)   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in the above
item, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission;
         (c)   Add together the individual net rate of emission derived in the
above item to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of
emission within the boundaries of the lot; such total shall not exceed four
pounds per acre of lot area during any one hour.

of the Commission and Town Council, certain commitments should be made for the
protection of the public interest and for the public health, safety and general
welfare of the town. A written commitment may establish the zoning district or
use or a range of uses permitted in the territory being considered by the

shall be subject to all penalties and fines set forth in the Zoning Code. In
addition, the written commitments may authorize and grant standing to certain
specially affected persons, corporations, property owners or classes of

all commitments.
   (F)   Automatic termination. A commitment made under this section shall

special exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, comfort, morals or general welfare and is in accordance with the

impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding

morals and general welfare of the community;
      (2)   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in

namely:
      (1)   A nonconforming use of neighboring lands, buildings or structures
in the same Zoning District, and a permitted use of lands, buildings or
structures in other Zoning Districts shall not be considered grounds for
approval of a variance. Any other variance granted in the same general area
shall not constitute grounds for approval of another similar variance;
      (2)   The variance shall be the minimum variance that will make possible
a reasonable use of the land, building or structure, equivalent to, but not
exceeding the use of similar lands, buildings or structures permitted generally
in the same Zoning District;
      (3)   A date shall be set for a public hearing on the variance not less
than ten days after the application for such is received and notice shall be
given as required herein. A public hearing shall be held before action is taken
on any variance;
      (4)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether each of the
requirements have been met. In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall prescribe conditions and safeguards to assure conformity with the
purposes of this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when
made part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Zoning Code.
      (5)   No variance shall be granted which will permit a use not permitted
in the pertinent Zoning District by this Zoning Code.
      (6)   Any approved variance shall become void if:
         (a)   The variance is not exercised within 90 days after being
granted;
         (b)   Any structure or characteristic of use permitted by variance is
moved, removed or discontinued;
      (7)   A request for variance may be initiated only by the property owners
and none other.
   (J)   Appeals to the Board.
      (1)   An appeal filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals must specify the
grounds of the appeal and must be filed within ten days from the date of the
action appealed from. In the event appeal is not taken, as specified herein,
the right of appeal shall be terminated.
      (2)   The administrative official or other body from whom the appeal is
taken shall, on the request of the Board of Zoning Appeals, transmit all
documents, plans and papers constituting the record of the action from which an
appeal was taken.
      (3)   Upon appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals may reverse, affirm or
modify the order, determination, requirement or decision appealed from. For
this purpose, the Board of Zoning Appeals has all the powers of the official,
officer, board or body from which the appeal is taken.
      (4)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a decision on any matter
that it is required to hear, as specified in this section, either:

copy of its decision within five days after making any decision.
   (K)   Public hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Zoning Appeals of
an appeal, or of an application for special exception, special use or variance,
a reasonable time and place for public hearing thereon shall be established and
notice thereof shall be given by the Town Clerk-Treasurer as follows:
      (1)   Submit a completed legal advertise- ment notice form to two
newspapers of general daily circulation in the town for one publication in each
newspaper at least ten days prior to the scheduled public hearing date;
      (2)   Obtain a certified list of the adjacent property owners to the
property involved in the application or appeal and either hand-deliver or mail
by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the completed legal
advertisement notice form to each adjacent property owner, as defined herein-
after. In the event an adjacent property owner owns more than parcel of
property, as indicated on the certified list, then that adjacent property owner
shall receive separate notices for each parcel owned, to be mailed separately,
with proof of separate mailing required. Hand-delivered notices must be
accompanied by a signed and dated verification of delivery. Notification to the
adjacent property owners must be made to each adjacent property owner at least
ten days prior to the date of the public hearing.
         (a)   The legal notice shall state the name of the legal owner of the
property. For example, in the event the property is held in a trust, then the
legal notice shall state the name of the bank and trust number. The legal
notice shall also include the nature of the request, namely, special use
permit, special exception, variance and the like.
         (b)   Adjacent property owners are defined as those property owners
within 500 feet of the subject property boundaries. The certified list of
