not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
such section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. Such section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture,
or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice

§ 34.03 PROCEDURES FOR TAX ABATEMENT.

revitalization, a taxpayer must first submit a Statement of Benefits (Form

of real property begins or the new manufacturing equipment is acquired.

manufacturing equipment can reasonably be expected from the proposed project.
Based upon these findings, the City Council must determine whether the benefits
set forth in the statement of benefits justifies the deduction (the deduction
may only be granted if the City Council determines that the described
redevelopment or rehabilitation and/or new manufacturing equipment can be
reasonably expected to yield the benefits identified in the statement of
benefits and that the benefits are sufficient to justify the deduction granted.

required to prepare and provide a resolution for approval of the City Council
and review by the City Attorney ten days prior to any scheduled meeting of the
City Council.
   (E)   The new manufacturing equipment shall be listed and attached to the
resolution benefits statement so the City Council can determine what equipment
exists or will exist.
   (F)   All rehabilitation/redevelopment of real property shall include a
specific list of improvements with values associated therewith.
   (G)   The Mayor may appoint a committee to meet with corporation, entity or
person for a site visit to discuss the specific abatement.
   (H)   The committee established in division (G) above will make a
recommendation to the full Council at its next regular meeting.
   (I)   The corporation, entity or persons requesting abatement or his or her
representatives may be present at the meeting to present the tax abatement and
answer any questions thereto at the request of the tax abatement committee.

proceed at an agreed later date.
         (b)   If the successful bidder elects to reject the contract and

of the project may not exceed 20% of the amount of the original contract;
however, a change order issued as a result of circumstances that could not have
been reasonably foreseen does not increase the scope of the project. All change
orders must be directly related to the original public work project.

in the original contract are needed, the cost of these units in the change
order must be the same as those shown in the original contract.

§ 52.03 SERVICE INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS AND CLASSES OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Commercial service is a connection which serves an apartment house
where there are three or more families residing or a store, factory or
institution which requires large quantities of water. The sizes of these
services shall be determined by consultation with the Board of Works. The Board
of Works may require, at its discretion, that separate customers in apartment
houses or commercial buildings with three or less consumer quarters or family
units, and in double houses, duplex flats or trailer camps be metered
separately in cases where one meter is presently installed and consumption is
less than combined minimums for all customers. Until such time as customer and/
or property owner re-aligns piping at his or her expense to facilitate
installation of separate meters, the monthly billing shall be not less than
combined minimums of all separate customer units served.
   (B)   Residence service is a connection which serves a residence wherein not
more than two families reside. The size of these services shall be not smaller
than five-eighths inch nor larger than one inch inside diameter of pipe.
   (C)   A service shall consist of: One corporation cock, three-fourths inch
in size for single-family residences and of a size as specified by Utility
Superintendent for apartments or commercial consumers, threaded into the water
main. Cooper pipe or plastic P.V.C. Spec. PE 3306 connected to the corporation
cock, and extending to not less than two feet outside the curb line.
   (D)   Water shall be turned off (or on) at curb cock in front of meter only
by a Water Department employee or a licensed plumber. All service pipes must
have stop and waste cocks between outside meter and consumer premises for
emergency shut-offs and making of repairs.
   (E)   In no case shall service pipes be allowed to run across from one lot
to another, but each lot shall be served by a service directly from the
distribution main serving the premises.
   (F)   All persons are forbidden to cover up or in any way interfere with any
curb-box, valve pit, valve box or hydrant. In the case of any automobile or
vehicular accident involving the breaking or disconnection of a fire hydrant,
the car owner involved shall pay for the repair of same.
(1992 Code, § 13.04.030) (Ord. 1969-24, passed 2-3-1970; Am. Ord. 2005-22,

52.99
§ 52.04 AVAILABILITY OR CAPACITY CHARGE.
   (A)   Upon application from one or more persons, the utility will make a
survey of the territory to be served and prepare an estimate of the costs of
constructing an extension to serve this territory. From this estimate, the
utility will calculate the amount of main extension deposit, if any, to be made
by the applicant, in the following manner:
 
(1)   Estimated cost of construction               $           
(2)   Monthly guaranteed minimum bill for three yea$          
(3)   Amount of main extension deposit             $          
 
   (B)   If the monthly guaranteed minimum bill for three years equals the
estimated cost of construction, no deposit by the applicant will be necessary.
   (C)   If the applicant desires, the deposit calculated as above, may be paid
as a special guaranteed monthly minimum, and at the expiration of the three-
year period the contract shall revert to the established minimum.
   (D)   After the deposits are made and contracts signed, the utility will
begin construction of the main.
Should the service of any consumer require more than 40 feet, from the main to
the property line, the extra expense shall be paid by the consumer, and not be
included in the estimate of construction costs. In addition to the items listed
above, there shall be added 12½% of the total of the foregoing items for
general overhead and contingencies.

companies or entities that fail to contact the Utility Superintendent shall be
responsible for removal or changing the location of the meter setting or meter
pit at the Utility Superintendent's discretion.

preclude the utility from also demanding from the new consumer, the payment of
all or any such charges which shall be unpaid at the time of the demand that
accrued since the last reading of the meter.
   (D)   Before service shall be granted to any applicant a deposit in an
amount equal to a two-months' usage being estimated by the Waterworks
Superintendent must be paid at the office of the utility. Deposits may be
required of commercial or industrial water consumers, the amount of deposit to
be determined by the Board of Works. The maximum deposit required of any

§ 52.14 GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Water service supplied by the city is for the use of the consumer at
the location given and the consumer agrees not to resell service, nor furnish
service to others. This will not, however, prevent a tenant from assuming the
obligation of payment.
   (B)   All consumers before piping a place for water, shall obtain from the
office of the utility the location of meter and service and other equipment
necessary for service.
   (C)   Written application shall be made for each service which shall be for

contracts. Services of all classes shall be by meter, except temporary services
(contractors, fairs, and the like, of short duration) and fire service.
   (D)   The utility will place the fire service to the property line nearest
the main, placing such valves as are necessary for the control of the service.
The consumer will be charged with the cost of making the connection and placing
the service. Fire services are for connection to sprinkler system and fire
protection systems, and using this connection for any other purpose is
prohibited. When it is found that a consumer is using water from fire service
for any other purpose than fire protection, the service shall be discontinued.
Before renewing the service, a meter of type approved for this service by the
Underwriters, shall be placed on the service, and all costs, of meter and
placing, shall be paid by consumer.
   (E)   The utility will bring services to the curb line and place curb stop
and box. The utility will place meter setting at curb, and the consumer will be
charged time and materials with the cost of this setting. The meter is
furnished by the utility. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent the meter
should be set at any other place, the line from the curb to the meter must be
suitable copper, brass, or cast iron pipe, except where exposed, and approved
by the Superintendent.
   (F)   Each property or separate location must have a separate service.
Service is given for the use of the applicant and no consumer shall be
permitted to furnish others, or other premises or property with water service.
   (G)   Each consumer must have a stop and waste cock installed in such manner
that the consumer may turn water off and on without using curb cock. If meter
is in the building stop and waste cock must be ahead of and behind the meter.
   (H)   Any change in service meter or connections after once installed, shall
be paid for by the consumer, except that the utility will make such changes as
necessary to provide required service. Any alteration in any building,
equipment, or plumbing which makes any change in meter location or connection
must be approved by the utility.
   (I)   Any negligent or willful damage to curb box, hydrant, meter or meter
setting will be paid for by the consumer.
   (J)   Meter settings are the property of the utility and no person but an
authorized representative of the utility may move, alter, connect, disconnect,
tamper with or change the meter setting in any way. Any interference with the
meter or the meter set is strictly prohibited subject to the penalties in §
52.99.
   (K)   When it is necessary to place a meter in a building, the location will
be selected by the utility and will be as close as possible to the water main.
Meters will not be placed in closets, bathrooms, bedrooms, coal bins, attics,
behind furnaces, or in any other place where the meter will not be plainly
visible and cannot be kept clean and free from injury.
   (L)   The readings of one meter will not be subtracted from readings of
another meter to obtain a consumer's consumption.
   (M)   New meter installations must be approved by the Utility
Superintendent. Old meter installations may be changed at the discretion of the
Utility Superintendent. If the Utility Superintendent determines the
installation inappropriate for any reason, the Utility Superintendent may order
the change of the location at the meter setting.
   (N)   When a meter is placed in a building any repairs necessary, except
those resulting from ordinary wear, must be paid for by the consumer. Repairs
to any meter whether at the curb or in the building, which is damaged by hot
water, electricity or heat, must be paid by the consumer. The utility may
require the consumer to place check valves and relief valves or other
protective devices in the line to prevent damage to meter.
   (O)   No person shall turn on or off or change in any way the curb cock or
meter setting on any water service, or any valve controlling any water service,
except as deemed necessary by the utility. When it is necessary to change the
curb cock or valve controlling the water service to work on water lines, it
shall be changed back to its original position on completion of the work. No
person except a representative of the utility has any authority to change the
status of a water service. No person, shall change, alter, move, remove, tamper
with, damage or operate any line, valves, machinery, equipment or property
belonging to or being a part of the system of the utility.
   (P)   Private wells are not permitted and customers are required to connect
to the city water utility, except existing wells may be used for purposes of
watering plants so long as the water has been tested and approved by the
utility. If any wells that are found not to be compliant with the Indiana State
Health Department rules regarding wells, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, then the
Superintendent shall order these persons to close their wells as required by
state law. Testing shall be done at suitable labs and shall be paid by the
customer at his expense at the time of connection to the system. Any existing
well must be detached from the system under the house and cut off and run
septic to outside of residence at the owner’s or customer’s expense. Separation
of the well will also be done at the owner’s expense. This separation must be
inspected to the satisfaction of the Utility Superintendent. The city may
require testing of these private wells at any time at the expense of the
customer. Failure to do so will cause enforcement under the terms of this
chapter. Cross connections between the utility system and any other source of
water supply is absolutely prohibited. When the utility furnishes water service
to any firm, corporation, person or persons using or being connected to another
source of water supply, the utility will require that the rules of the State
Board of Health be followed. Any use of private wells that are used in conflict
with this chapter shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall
constitute a $2,500 fine, with each day constituting a separate violation and a
fine of $2,500.
   (Q)   The utility may, at the discretion of the Utility Superintendent,
disconnect any customer who prevents the utility from reading, inspecting or
servicing any meter valves or appurtenances in any way or manner, including,
but not limited to, any animals that prevent the representatives of the utility
from inspections, readings or any other activities associated with the meter
setting or appurtenances in any manner necessary for utility purposes.
   (R)   The Utility Superintendent has the authority to make discretionary
decisions concerning any connection, disconnection, locations, or any other
necessary decisions to continue the city utility operations pending
presentation of this rationale to the Board of Works.

chapter, pretreatment of industrial wastes from contributing industries prior
to discharge of the treatment works is subject to the EPA Rules and Regulations
as contained in 40 C.F.R. pt. 403 and New Sources of Pollution dated January
28, 1981, as amended.
   (C)   Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to
pretreatment control facilities shall be submitted for approval of the Board
and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until approval in
writing is granted and an IDEM construction permit is obtained. Where such
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operating order by the owner at his or her expense and shall be
subject to periodic inspection by the city to determine that such facilities
are being operated in conformance with the applicable federal, state and local
laws and permits. The owner shall maintain operating records of the influent
and effluent to show the performance of the treatment facilities and for
comparison against the Board or its representative's monitoring records.
   (D)   The Board and its representatives may require users of the treatment
works to supply pertinent information on wastewater characteristics. This
information may be requested on a monthly or quarterly basis. Such
measurements, tests and analyses shall be made at the users' expense.
   (E)   When required by the Superintendent and subject to approval by the
Board, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying non-
residential wastes shall install a suitable control manhole(s) together with
such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole
(s), when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The
manhole(s) shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be

of the city, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all properties for
the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.
   (F)   The strength of wastewaters shall be determined, for periodic
establishment of charges provided for in this chapter, from samplings taken at
the aforementioned structure at any period of time and of such duration and in
such manner as the city may elect, or, at any place mutually agreed upon
between the user and the city. Appropriate charges for sampling and analysis
may be assessed to the user at the option of the city. The results of routine
sampling and analysis by the user may also be used for determination of charges
after verification by the city.
   (G)   Periodically, at least once each calendar quarter, the city may
monitor the discharge from any non-domestic source and bill the discharger the
cost of monitoring and analyzing for any or all controlled pollutants. The city
shall reserve the right to conduct additional inspection, testing, and
monitoring as is deemed appropriate to ensure that dischargers are in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole, except for application for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the USEPA, 40 CFR Part 136 and any subsequent revisions
subject to approval by the city. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by the customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, health and property. (The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-
hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.)
   (J)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (K)   Industrial cooling water, which may be polluted with insoluble oils or

include location of the discharge, date and time of occurrence, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions which were taken.
   (C)   This notification shall be followed, within ten days of the date of
the occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the accidental
discharge, the causes, duration including times and dates of non-compliance,
and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrences.
   (D)   Such notification will not relieve the users of a liability for any
expense, loss, or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant, or treatment
process, or for any fines imposed by the city by state or federal regulations,
rules and statutes.
   (E)   In order that employees of users be informed of city requirements,
users shall make available to their employees copies of this chapter and
together with such other wastewater information and notices which may be
furnished by the city from time to time, directed toward more effective water
pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on a
user's bulletin board or other conspicuous place advising whom to call in case
of accidental discharge in violation of this chapter. This shall be
conspicuously posted at the offices or facility of said business or entity.

established in harmony therewith.
   (E)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids into the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly,
are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water
meter, then in such case billing shall be for a single service in the manner
set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall not be less than
the number of such dwelling units times $26.33 per month. In the case of mobile
home courts the number of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as
the total number of mobile homes located and installed in the court plus any
other dwelling units served through the meter. A dwelling unit shall be
interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking
facilities are provided.
   (F)   In the event that any parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the municipal water works, and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the city, then the city shall have the right to require the owner or other
interested party, at his or her expense, to install and maintain meters, wires,
volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city.
   (G)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the city's water works and, in addition, uses water from another
source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not
acceptable to the city, then the owner or other interested party, at his or her
expense, shall install and maintain meters, wires, volumetric measuring devices
or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city.
   (H)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 2,000 cubic feet per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction
of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters
does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other
interested party shall install and maintain meters, wires, volumetric measuring
devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (I)   In order that the rates and charges may he justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered, the city shall base the charges not only on
the volume, but also on the strength and character of the sewage and wastes
which it is required to treat and dispose of. The city shall require the owner
or other user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes
discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in
such manner and by such method as the city may deem practicable in the light of
conditions and pending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the
proper charge. The owner or other user shall furnish a central sampling point
available to the city at all times.
   (J)   In the event that the Council determines that it is necessary to
extend service to customers outside the city corporation limits, the surcharge
for sewer and water shall be no greater than 50% of the rates and charges for
those customers of the city within the corporation limits.

§ 53.37 EXTRA CHARGES.
   (A)   Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes
shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.86 per cubic feet of flow each 300 milligrams, or
fraction thereof, of suspended solids in excess of 300 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge
of $.124 per 100 cubic feet of flow for each 100 milligrams, or fraction
thereof, of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 milligrams per liter of
fluid.
   (B)   To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and
analysis shall be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the
city. After charges have been established based upon the strength of sewage and
wastes, the owner may request reconsideration of these charges by the city by
submitting analysis of composite samples of the sewage and wastes subject to
such charges, certified by a registered engineer or a qualified graduate
chemist. The city may then adjust the charges to the ordinance rates required
by such analysis or may recheck the findings by additional samplings and
analysis. Requests for rate adjustments by the owner may be submitted no more
than once every 12 months.
   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day bio-chemical oxygen
demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes as
written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation.
   (D)   Except for billings to multiple users such as apartment houses, mobile
home courts and housekeeping rooms, the rates and charges may be billed to the
tenant or tenants occupying the properties served unless otherwise requested in
writing by the owners, but such billings shall in no way relieve the owner from
liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of
the properties served which are occupied by tenants shall have the right to
examine the collections records of the city for the purpose of determining
whether such rates and charges have been paid by such tenants, provided that
such examinations shall be made at the office at which said records are kept
and during the hours that such office is kept open for business.

§ 53.38 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS REQUIRED.
   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and
equitable and to maintain the sound financial position of the sewage works, the
Common Council shall cause a financial study to be made not less often than
three years. Such financial study shall include, but not be limited to, the
kind and character of industrial wastes being treated and the contribution of
industry to the costs of providing such services by the city, the financial
position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenues to provide
reasonable funds for operation and maintenance, debt service requirements and
capital improvements to the plant and system. Such investigation and
determination may be made by officers and/or employees of the city or be a firm
of certified public accountants experienced in such work.

§ 53.52 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage,
uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which
is a part of the municipal sewage works. Any person preventing or prohibiting
inspection is also in violation of this section.
   (B)   The Board of Works may immediately and without prior notice suspend
the wastewater treatment service of a discharger if it appears to the city,
based upon factors addressed in this chapter or any other city ordinance, that
an actual or threatened discharge presents an imminent danger to the welfare of
persons, to the environment, to the operation of the city's wastewater
treatment plant, or contaminates the resultant sludge and jeopardizes the
opportunity for its disposal through land application, or violates any
discharge limits. Any discharger notified of the suspension of wastewater
treatment service must immediately cease all discharges. If the discharger
fails to comply voluntarily with a suspension order, the city may immediately
physically suspend service by disconnection from the system, and/or commence
judicial proceeding to compel the discharger's compliance with the order.
   (C)   Whenever the city finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
other than that set forth in division (A) above, which justifies revocation of
a permit or suspension of service, the city will serve the discharger with oral
notice first and then written notice thereafter, either personally or by
certified or registered mail, stating the nature of the alleged violation. With
ten days of the date of receipt of this notice, the discharger must respond in
writing to the city, advising of its position with respect to the allegations.
Thereafter, the parties must meet to determine the seriousness of the
allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction of the violation. Upon establishment of a plan to correct the
violation, the Board may reconsider reconnection to the sanitary system.
   (D)   Where a violation of the city's ordinance or applicable pretreatment
regulations occurs, or if a discharger fails to comply with division (C) above
and is not corrected by timely compliance, the city may order any discharger to
show cause before them and state why the proposed permit revocation action
should not be taken. A written notice must be served on the discharger by
personal service, certified or registered, specifying the time and place of a
hearing to be held by the city. The hearing will consider the violations, the
proposed enforcement action, reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken,
and directing the discharger to show cause before the city as to why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing must
be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent, officer, or representative of a discharger. The evidence presented at
the hearing will be considered by the Board of Works and appropriate orders
with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger will be
issued.
   (E)   Any customer affected by any decision, action, or determination made
by the Superintendent, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this
chapter or in any permit issued herein, may file with the city a written
request for reconsideration within ten days of such decision, action, or
determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request
for reconsideration.
   (F)   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes
into a city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the municipal ordinance,
federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the City
Attorney may commence a judicial action for appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief.

§ 53.53 ABATEMENT.
   When a discharge of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or any other
impairment to the city's facilities, the city may assess a charge against the
user for the work required to clean or repair the facility and add such charge
to the user's charges and fees. Whenever the city suspends service due to
violation of this section or closes services by physical disconnection, the
city may assess all costs, expenses, and attorney fees to the landowner and/or
tenant whose service was suspended or disconnected.

§ 53.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or permit
condition or who discharges wastewater which causes pollution, or who violates
any cease and desist order, prohibition, effluent limitation, national standard
of performance, pretreatment or toxicity standard shall be fined in an amount
not to exceed $2,500 per day. Each day such violation occurs or continues shall
constitute a separate violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Any person who discharges sewage, industrial waste, wastewater, or
other waste into the collection and/or treatment system of the city shall be
governed by the provisions of this chapter and all applicable, local, state,
and federal laws and regulations and shall indemnify the city and be liable for
any fine, penalty, or judgment assessed against the city and/or its duly
authorized agents as a result of the person's violation of the local, state, or
federal law or regulation.
   (C)   Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or
certification in any application, report, or other document required by this
chapter or other applicable regulations, or who tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device, will, upon conviction, be punished by
the imposition of a civil penalty as required by the local and/or state
statutes.
   (D)   Fees; nonpayment; delinquency penalty; civil action to recover. If
fees assessed against real property under this chapter or as provided by
Indiana State law, are not paid within the time fixed by the municipal
legislative body, they are delinquent. A penalty of 10% of the amount of fees
attaches to the delinquent fees. The amount of the fee, the penalty, and a
reasonable attorney's fee may be recovered by the Board in a civil action in
the name of the municipality.
   (E)   Fees; non-payment; creation of lien; priority; time of attachment;
notice; subsequent owners; release.
      (1)   Fees assessed against the real property under this chapter or as
provided under Indiana law, constitute a lien against the property assessed.
The lien is superior to all other liens except tax liens. Except as provided in
divisions (E)(2) and (3) below, the lien attaches when notice of the lien is
filed in the county recorder's office under Indiana law.
      (2)   A fee is not enforceable as a lien against a subsequent owner of
property unless the lien for the fee was recorded with the County Recorder
before the conveyance to the subsequent owner. If the property is conveyed
before the lien can be filed, the municipality shall notify the person who
owned the property at the time the fee became payable. The notice must inform
the person that payment, including penalty fee for delinquencies, is due not
less than 15 days after the date of notice. If payment is not received within
180 days after the date of the notice, the amount due may be expensed as a bad
debt loss.
      (3)   A lien attaches against real property occupied by someone other
than the owner only if the utility notified the owner within 20 days after the
time the utility fees became 60 days delinquent. However, the utility is
required to give notice to the owner only if the owner has given the general
office of the utility written notice of the address to which his or her notice
is to be sent.
      (4)   The municipality shall release:
         (a)   Liens filed with the County Recorder after the recorded date of
conveyance of the property; and
         (b)   Delinquent fees incurred by the seller, upon receipt of a varied
demand in writing from the purchaser. The demand must state that the delinquent
fees were not incurred by the purchaser as a user, lessee, or previous owner,
and that the purchaser has not been paid by the seller for the delinquent fees.

§ 97.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Findings. The use of outdoor wood-fired boilers is declared to be a
nuisance due to the large volumes of smoke produced and released low to the
ground which will add to the pollutant levels in the air and can cause or
contribute to short-term health problems such as eye, nose, throat and lung
irritations, coughing and shortness of breath, and may exacerbate asthma and
other lung-related illnesses; and the general population density within the
city limits means that the negative aspects of low-to-ground wood smoke is more
likely to occur causing the health problems listed above and greatly diminish
the use and enjoyment of neighboring property.
   (B)   Purpose. To ensure against the findings of division (A) above, the
Common Council of the City of Rushville has determined that it is necessary to
establish this chapter banning outdoor wood-fired boilers within the City of

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
City Council of the City of Rushville does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Rushville are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the City of Rushville by fulfilling the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health.
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as ZONE A, ZONE AE, ZONES A1-A30,
ZONE AO, ZONE AH, ZONE AR and ZONE A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole bams, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including
but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads, or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP. As related to variances of this chapter, the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new
business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA), LETTER OF MAP REVISION
(LOMR), and LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in
a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision
by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929, a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within
the floodplain.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the start of construction
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain
ordinance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
   NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of any river or stream other than
a boundary river.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993, a

where more  comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.07. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of

   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Rushville subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of
the City of Rushville are generally identified as such on the Rush County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated January 7, 2015,
as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are
shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, Al-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the  actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See A ZONE.

is possible. No mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply, but
coverage is available in participating communities.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)

(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.39 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.07 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving, and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indians Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
151.35 through
151.42 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the City of Rushville shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.40 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
151.35 through
151.42 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.41 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment.
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
151.35 through
151.42 have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
151.35 through
151.42 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2014-20, passed 9-16-2014) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
151.35 through
151.42.
