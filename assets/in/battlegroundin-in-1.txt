§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the town, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Town of
Battle Ground Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified
ordinances,” or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter, and section
headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto, and newly enacted laws. Any previously existing law or amendment

repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters, or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons unless otherwise

or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended or its
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a

changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.

deemed to apply to any office, officer, or employee of this municipality
exercising the powers, duties, or functions contemplated in the provision,

the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority, or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties, or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority, or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers, and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.

be a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under
the section unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected
by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for

a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this

thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

officer who is injured or contracts an illness in the course of or as the
result of the performance of duties as a reserve police officer. The town’s
legislative body may at its discretion, by appropriate legislation and
appropriation, obtain policies of group insurance to insure each reserve police
officer for life, accident and sickness coverage and to meet its obligations
under I.C. 36-8-3-22 and I.C. 36-8-3-23.
   (H)   Probationary period and discharge. All reserve police officers serve
at the pleasure of the Marshal and/or the Town Police Department and the
legislative body of the town and shall serve a probationary period of six
months. Reserve police officers may be discharged at any time, for any cause,
by the Town Marshal and/or Town Police Department or legislative body of the
town. Completion of the probationary period described herein is a condition
precedent to a reserve police officer being permitted to engage in reserve
police officer duties and responsibilities as described herein.
   (I)   Authority. Reserve police officers, upon completion of their initial
training, may be granted full authority to act in the capacity of a sworn
police officer for the town. The authority granted to and provided a reserve

DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
§ 33.15 OVERVIEW.
   The town makes a commitment to provide employees a safe working environment,
to ensure that employees, equipment, and operating practices comply with health
and safety standards, and to maintain public confidence in the town and its
employees. Since the town values each employee, the town offers employees
assistance in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse problems.
(Ord. 2005-436, passed 6-13-2005)
§ 33.16 POLICY.
   (A)   The town requires all employees to report for work in a condition that
allows them to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. Employees
will not be permitted to work under the influence of alcohol or with prohibited
drugs in their systems thereby affecting job performance.
   (B)   Violation of any provision of this subchapter will be considered just
cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge, even for a first
offense. In addition, refusal to adhere to any part of the policy may be
considered an act of insubordination and also may lead to disciplinary action,

   (C)   This subchapter and related procedures may be modified by the town at
any time in order to comply with any applicable federal, state, or local laws,
or to better serve the needs of the town.

§ 33.17 PROHIBITED DRUGS.
   (A)   PROHIBITED DRUGS are defined as illegal substances, including
controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §
812) and the Code of Federal Regulations (21 C.F.R. §§ 1308.11 to 1308.15) and

   (B)   This section prohibits the illegal use, sale, transfer, distribution,
possession, or unlawful manufacture of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled
substances while on the job or on county premises (including vehicles used for
town business). These include, but are not limited to, marijuana, cocaine,
crack, PCP, heroin, LSD, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and barbiturates.

containers. Such containers are not allowed on the job or on town premises,

(Ord. 2005-436, passed 6-13-2005) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 33.19 REPORTING VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Employees must, as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of
this subchapter and report any conviction to the town under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off town premises when conducting town
business. Report of a conviction must be made to the town within five business
days after the conviction. The town will then notify the appropriate
contracting officer within ten days after receiving notice from either the
employee or from another source. (These requirements are mandated by the Drug-
Free Workplace Act of 1988, being 41 U.S.C. §§ 8101 et seq.)
   (B)   An employee who is involved with off the job illegal drug activity may
be considered in violation of this subchapter. In determining whether
disciplinary action will be imposed for this activity, the town will consider
the circumstance of each incident, including, but not limited to, any adverse
effect the employee’s actions may have on its customers, other employees, the
public, or the county’s reputation and image.
   (C)   Any questions regarding the reporting of violations should be directed
to the Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 2005-436, passed 6-13-2005)
§ 33.20 EMPLOYEE REHABILITATION.
   (A)   Health maintenance is primarily a personal responsibility, and it is
the individual’s responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance or
behavioral problems caused by alcohol or drug abuse. In an effort to assist
employees, the town will provide various means for employees and their family
members to remain aware of the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace and
to overcome drug and alcohol related problems.
   (B)   Employees with a personal alcohol or drug related problem are
encouraged to volunteer to participate in a approved rehabilitation program
upon referral from the Employee and Family Assistance Program, before work
performance becomes affected.
   (C)   Participation in a rehabilitation program will not be considered a
barrier to not a cause for disciplinary action. Employees will not be
disciplined merely because of participation in a rehabilitation program or
excused from the disciplinary consequences of conduct which is in violation of
this subchapter or any other town policies or job requirements.
   (D)   Any employee identified through a town investigation as having a
substance abuse problem also may not avoid disciplinary action by requesting to
participate in an approved rehabilitation program.
   (E)   Circumstances in each case will be evaluated to determine the course
of action to be taken (i.e., whether the employee will be offered the
opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program and/or will be subject
to discipline).

      (2)   During and after participation in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation
program for a reasonable period of time as determined by the town; and/or
      (3)   When required by law.
   (C)   If a supervisor identifies an employee with a behavior pattern and/or
job performance reasonably indicative of substance abuse, the supervisor (with
the concurrence of the next level of supervision) may recommend that the
employee have a fitness for duty examination by a physician designated by the
town. The physician will determine whether a fitness for duty examination is
necessary and whether alcohol or drug tests will be required.
   (D)   Pre-employment drug testing is part of the pre-employment physical.
The method of testing will be determined by the town. Applicants who test
positive for prohibited drugs in their systems will not be offered employment.
Any questions regarding reapplication opportunities should be directed to the
Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 2005-436, passed 6-13-2005)
NEPOTISM POLICY
§ 33.35 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Decisions about hiring, promoting, evaluating, awarding salary
increases, job assignment, terminating employees, and the awarding of contracts
for goods, services, and public works projects should be based on the
qualifications, performance, and ability of the employee or contractor. Every
attempt to avoid favoritism and conflicts of interest in employment related and
contractual decisions instills confidence of the electorate in its government.
   (B)   The purpose of this policy is to prohibit certain individuals from
being employed by the town in a position in which a relative, as defined in
this subchapter, provides direct supervision. Additionally, this policy
regulates contracting with relatives of individuals employed by the town for
goods, services, and public works projects.
(Ord. 2012-499, passed 6-21-2012)
§ 33.36 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

from the town. A BREAK IN EMPLOYMENT does not occur due to absence from the
workplace while on a paid or unpaid leave, including, but not limited to:
vacation, personal days, sick or family medical leave, or worker’s compensation
leave, or if the employment is terminated followed by immediate re-employment
by the town without loss of payroll time.
   DIRECT LINE OF SUPERVISION. An elected officer or employee who is in a
position to affect the terms and conditions of another individual’s employment.
Such effect may include, but is not limited to, making decisions about work
assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement, or performance evaluation.
Decisions and actions taken by the Town Council regarding the passage of annual
salary ordinances, budgets, and personnel policies are excluded from this
definition.
   ELECTED OFFICIAL. Town Clerk-Treasurer and members of the Town Council.
   EMPLOYED. An individual who works for or is appointed to any department or
board of the town on a full-time, part-time, temporary, intermittent, seasonal,
hourly, or contractual basis.
   MEMBER OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. The Police Chief and any police officer
appointed to the Town Police Department.
   RELATIVE. Includes any of the following:
      (1)   Spouse;
      (2)   Parent or step-parent;
      (3)   Child or step-child (includes an adopted child);

§ 33.37 EMPLOYMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Individuals who are relatives, as defined in §
33.36, of existing employees may not be employed by the town in a position that
results in one relative being in the direct line of supervision of the other
relative.
   (B)   An individual who is employed by the town on July 1, 2012, is not
subject to this nepotism policy unless the individual has a break in
employment, as defined in §
33.36, with the town.
   (C)   If an individual is employed by the town and the individual’s relative
begins serving a term of elected office, the individual may continue his or her
employment with the town and retain his or her position or rank even if that
individual’s position or rank would be in the direct line of supervision of the
individual’s relative.
   (D)   While an individual who is employed by the town and the individual’s
relative begins serving a term of elected office may continue his or her
employment with the town, that individual may not be promoted to a position or
rank if the new position or rank would place that individual within the direct
line of supervision of the individual’s relative.
   (E)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement, or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority, he or she
will not be in the direct line of supervision. See I.C. 36-4-6-11 and 36-5-2-
9.4.
   (F)   The Town Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July 1, 2012
by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from

chlorine requirement to such degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the Superintendent for such materials;
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;

      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in division (D) above, and which, in the
judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitutes a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require the pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge
to the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of division (J) below. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plans and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.

opinion of the said Inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (H)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Waste Water, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern.

the town who contributes directly or indirectly to the storm water system of
the town in an amount defined in division (D) below.
   (B)   It is hereby established that an equivalent residential unit (ERU)
shall be based upon 3,200 square feet of impervious surface area.
   (C)   All properties having impervious surface area within the town shall be
assigned an ERU, or multiple thereof, with all properties having impervious
area assigned at least one ERU.
   (D)   The storm water service charge for one ERU is hereby established at
the rate in the following table.
 
Effective Date            Monthly Rate per ERU
January 1, 2018           $6
January 1, 2019           $7
January 1, 2020           $8
January 1, 2021           $9
January 1, 2022           $10
January 1, 2023 and after $11
 
   (E)   The total service charge for a particular property shall be determined
by taking the number of ERUs assigned to a particular property and multiplying
it by the established rate.
   (F)   Residential properties shall be assessed a monthly service charge for
storm water service of one ERU. This flat fee shall apply to all residential
properties as defined herein.
      (1)   Contiguous residential properties having common ownership and
sharing a single structure containing two or fewer dwelling units shall be
assigned one ERU.

shall be individually calculated. Nonresidential properties shall be assessed a
monthly service charge for storm water service based upon the total number of
ERUs that encompasses the measured impervious surface area on the individual
property. The calculation to determine the total number of ERUs for a
nonresidential property shall be completed by dividing the total square footage
of measured impervious surface area for a property by 3,200 square feet. The
division shall be calculated to the first decimal place. Total ERUs shall not
be less than one for any nonresidential property containing measurable surface
area.
   (H)   Only whole ERUs shall be used in determining the assignment of gross
ERUs to a property. All rounding necessary to reach the appropriate whole ERU
shall be done according to mathematical convention (0 to 0.4 rounded down to
the nearest whole ERU; 0.5 to 0.9 rounded up to the nearest whole ERU).
   (I)   Non-developed residential lots within the town shall be charged a rate
not less than one-half ERUs. Non-developed property outside of residential
areas but within the town shall be charged a rate not less than one-half ERUs
per acre of non-developed land contributing to watersheds under the
jurisdiction of the town.

rendered monthly, in accordance with the regular sewage utility billing cycle,
by the utility billing division of the town for all properties subject to the
fee. Bills shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject
to the same penalties as set forth for the sewer utility. Any partial payment
of a combined utility bill shall be applied first to the storm water utility
user fee. Any unpaid storm water utility user fees shall constitute a lien on
such property except the liens of state, county, and municipal taxes and shall
be on a parity with the lien of such state, county, and municipal taxes. Such
lien, when delinquent for more than 30 days, may be foreclosed by the town in
the manner provided by the laws of the state for the foreclosure of mortgagees
on real property.
   (B)   For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for other town
services, the storm water utility user fee shall be included in the monthly
sewage utility bill rendered to the established customer.
   (C)   For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other town
services, the bill or statement for the storm water utility user fee shall be
sent to the storm water utility user as determined from the tax rolls. The
Board may render annual, semiannual, or monthly billings, to be billed in
arrears, to coincide with the property tax schedule, on such properties if
determined to be the best interest of the town.
   (D)   The owner of a property is ultimately responsible for all fees imposed
under this chapter.

notice. The Town Marshal shall send one copy of such notice to the Chief of
Traffic Division and one copy to the Traffic Violations Bureau.

governing the standing or parking of a vehicle proof that the particular
vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of any such law or
regulation, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was,
at the time of such parking, the registered owner of such vehicle, shall
constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of

where and for the time during which such violation occurred. Such presumption
may be rebutted by any proper admissible evidence of probative effect.
      (2)   The state presumption in division (E)(1) above shall apply only
when the procedure as prescribed in divisions (C) and (D) above have been
followed.
   (F)   When complaint to be issued. In the event any person fails to comply

parked illegally as to constitute a definite hazard or obstruction to the
normal movement of traffic.
      (2)   Whenever the Town Marshal removes a vehicle from a street as
authorized in this section and the town marshal knows or is able to ascertain
from the registration records in the vehicle the name and address of the owner
thereof, the Town Marshal shall immediately give or cause to be given notice in
writing to such owner of the fact of such removal and the reason therefor and
of the place to which such vehicle has been removed. In the event any such
vehicle is stored in a public garage, a copy of such notice shall be given to

structural strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was before
such catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements for new buildings of
similar structure, purpose, and location;
         (e)   Whenever any portion, member, or appurtenance thereof is likely
to fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property;

or ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one-half of that specified for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location without exceeding the
working stresses permitted for such buildings;
         (g)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled, or
settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have
materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case
of similar new construction;

because of dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction; the
removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for
the purpose of supporting such building; the deterioration, decay, or
inadequacy of its foundation; or any other cause, it is likely to partially or
completely collapse;
         (i)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any
portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used;
         (j)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members
list, lean, or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the

characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by
law in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height, and
occupancy in the same location;
         (o)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used
for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air, or
sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the Health Officer of the
county (health official) to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in
such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease;
         (p)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction is determined by the appropriate fire
official and/or State Fire Marshal to be a fire hazard;
         (q)   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public; and

submission by applicant of a plan for securing said property, as well as a plan
