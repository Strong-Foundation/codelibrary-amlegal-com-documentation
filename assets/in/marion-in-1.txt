titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Marion
Code,” for which designation “Code of Ordinances,” “Codified Ordinances,” “City

same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to

previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only, and is not a part of the section.

original position.

sick leave from year to year and to accrue unused sick leave.
   (C)   Scope. This policy applies to all civil city employees, subject to
modification by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement entered into
by the city with a bargaining representative (union), except for those
employees covered by the Police and Fire Pension Plan.
   (D)   Purpose. This policy is designed to define paid sick leave and to
enumerate rules for accrual and use of sick leave benefits.
   (E)   General.
      (1)   Each full-time employee shall be entitled to six sick days per
calendar year. Any employee who is employed by the city shall begin January 1
with six sick days. Persons who become employees of the city in subsequent
months shall begin with six sick days minus one-half sick day for every full
month they were not an employee of the city.
      (2)   If an employee leaves city employment and has taken sick leave in
excess of one-half day per month, his or her paycheck shall be adjusted
accordingly.
      (3)   An employee shall only be paid for the days he or she is off for
illness if the employee directly reports to the department head for which he or
she works within one-half hour after that department’s normal starting time.
Further, if an employee uses three consecutive sick days, a written statement
from a doctor must be presented to the employee’s department head before the
missed time can be granted as compensated sick leave. This statement may also
be required by the department head if the department head has reason to believe
that an employee is abusing the use of sick leave by chronic, periodic or
habitual absences or in some other fashion.
      (4)   If an employee is absent or anticipates being absent due to illness
more than five consecutive work days, the employee shall request extended leave
pursuant to the provisions in this personnel policy providing for leaves of
absence. The employee may be required to provide a physician’s statement of the
employee’s physical ability to fully discharge his or her duties.
      (5)   Employees can accumulate sick days from year to year up to 20 days.

(1985 Code, § 22-9-1-12.1(a)) (Ord. 29-1968, passed 9-3-1968; Am. Ord. 15-1979,
passed 8-8-1979; Am. Ord. 13-1984, passed 7-5-1984)
§ 37.02 PUBLIC POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the public policy of the city to provide all its citizens equal
opportunity for education, employment, access to public conveniences and
accommodations and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property,
including, but not limited to housing, and to eliminate discrimination or
separation based on race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin or
ancestry, since such discrimination is an impediment to equal opportunity.
Equal education employment opportunities and equal access to and use of public
accommodations and equal opportunity for acquisition of real property are civil
rights.
   (B)   The practice of denying these rights to properly qualified persons
because of race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin or ancestry is
contrary to the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity and is a
burden to the objectives of the public policy of the city and shall be deemed
discriminatory practices. The promotion of equal opportunity without regard to
race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin or ancestry is the
purpose of this subchapter.
   (C)   It is also the public policy of the city to protect employers, labor
organizations, employment agencies, property owners, real estate brokers,
builders and lending institutions from unfounded charges of discrimination.
   (D)   It is contrary to the public policy of the city and a discriminatory
practice for any owner, real estate broker, salesperson or any other person or
agent thereof:
      (1)   To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer or
to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of or otherwise make unavailable
or deny a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin or handicap;
      (2)   To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions or
privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in the providing of services or
facilities in connection therewith, because of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin or handicap;
      (3)   To make, print or publish or cause to be made, printed or published
any notice, statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a
dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation or discrimination based on
race, color, religion, sex, national origin or handicap;
      (4)   To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin or handicap that dwelling is not available for inspection, sale
or rental when such is in fact so available;
      (5)   To induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any
dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the
neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex
or national origin.
   (E)   It is contrary to the public policy of the city and a discriminatory
practice for any person whose business consists in the making of real estate
loans to deny a loan or other financial assistance to a person applying
therefore for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing or
maintaining a dwelling or to discriminate against him or her in fixing the
amount, interest rate, duration or other terms or conditions of that loan or
other financial assistance, because of race, color, religion, sex or national
origin of that person or of any person associated with him or her in connection
with such loan or other financial assistance or of the present or prospective
owners, lessees, tenants or occupants of the dwelling or dwellings in relation
to which that loan or other financial assistance is to be made or given.
   (F)   It is contrary to the public policy of the city and a discriminatory
practice for any person to deny any person access to or memberships or
participation in any multiple-listing service, real estate brokers’
organization or other service, organization or facility relating to the
business of selling or renting dwellings or to discriminate against him or her
in the terms or conditions of that access, membership or participation on
account of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
   (G)   It is against the public policy of the city and a discriminatory act
for any lending institution, including government agencies, to discriminate in
lending money, guaranteeing loans, accepting mortgages or otherwise making
available funds for the purchase, acquisition, construction, rehabilitation,
repair or maintenance of any housing unit because of the geographical location
of property or race, color, sex, handicap, national origin or ancestry of any
prospective buyer or seller.

for a term of three years.
   (B)   Commission members shall be eligible for appointment to no more than
three consecutive terms. If a member vacates his or her seat, a successor shall

under investigation.
   (D)   The Commission shall elect from its membership at its annual meeting a
Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Financial Advisor and Secretary.
   (E)   A quorum consisting of five Commissioners shall be present at all
meetings in order to conduct business.
   (F)   The expenses for carrying out the activities of the Director and

(1985 Code, § 22-9-1-12.1(c)) (Ord. 29-1968, passed 9-3-1968; Am. Ord. 15-1979,
passed 8-8-1979; Am. Ord. 13-1984, passed 7-5-1984)
§ 37.04 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   To establish and maintain a permanent office in the city;
   (B)   To appoint an Executive Director who shall be compensated for his or
her services and to retain other employees appointed by the Director;
   (C)   To set out rules, regulations and guidelines for the operation of the
office and duties and responsibilities of the Director, staff and employees;
   (D)   To create subcommittees and advisory committees as in its judgment
will aid in effectuating the purpose of this subchapter;
   (E)   To issue publications and results of investigations and research as in
its judgment will tend to minimize or eliminate discrimination because of race,
religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin or ancestry;
   (F)   To initiate or receive charges of discriminatory practices or
complaints. Upon the request of the complainant, the Commission or staff shall
aid the complainant in drafting the complaint. To be acceptable to the
Commission, a complaint shall be sufficiently complete so as to reflect
properly the name, address and telephone (if any) of the complainant; the name,
address and telephone (if any) of the respondent against whom the complaint is
made; the alleged discriminatory practice and a statement of particulars
thereof; the date or dates and places of the alleged discriminatory practice;
if it is of a continuing nature, the dates between which those continuing acts
of discrimination are alleged to have occurred; and a statement as to any other
action, civil or criminal, instituted in any other form based upon the same
grievance as alleged in the complaint, together with a statement as to the
status or disposition of those other actions. No complaint shall be valid
unless filed within 90 days after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory
practice or from the date of the termination of a published and meaningful
grievance procedure provided by a respondent employer or labor union. No
complaint shall be filed both with the city and with the state;
   (G)   To receive and investigate charges of discriminatory practices of
complainants. All investigations of complaints shall be conducted by the
Director or staff members of the City Human Relations Commission. The Director
and staff shall make reasonable effort to conciliate all issues raised during
the investigation of the case. The Director or staff members who conduct an
investigation shall not communicate their opinion and recommendations to the
Commissioners who may ultimately adjudicate the complaint. When that
investigator is unable to conciliate the complaint, and facts are sufficient
enough to support a finding of probable cause, the investigator shall refer the
case to three Commissioners appointed as hearing officers on a rotating basis
by the Chairperson of the Commission or his or her designee, who shall receive
the case and make their determination of probable cause or no probable cause.
If the recommendation of two of the three hearing officers is that probable
cause exists, that finding shall be made, and the complainant and respondent
shall be furnished with a copy of the findings of fact and recommendations. If
no conciliation agreement is reached, the case then is referred to the
Commission for public hearing. When the recommendation after the investigation
is that no probable cause exists, the complainant shall be given ten days to
make a written request, with the reasons therefore, to the Commission for
review of the finding. Upon the receipt of the request for review, the
Chairperson shall appoint a Commissioner to review that request. Whenever that
Commissioner is named for the purpose of reviewing a request for
reconsideration by the complainant, that Commissioner shall be disqualified
from any further participation in that case. The Commissioner chosen shall not
be one of the three hearing officers, except as a witness at a public hearing
on the complaint. However, if a Commissioner’s previous disqualification would
deprive the Commission of a quorum or majority, the Chairperson shall designate
which Commissioners need not be disqualified. If the reviewing Commissioner
shall reach the same decision as the three appointed probable cause hearing
officers; the decision shall be final upon approval by a majority vote of the
Commissioners who are qualified to participate in the final decision;
   (H)   To prevent any person from discharging, expelling or otherwise
discriminating against any other person because he or she filed a complaint or
testified in any hearing before the Commission or in any way assisted the
Commission in any matter under its investigation;
   (I)   To issue a temporary emergency order against any person requiring that
person to do an act preserving the possibility of a remedy during the
investigation or to refrain from doing an act damaging the possibility of a
remedy during the investigation of the complaint. However:
      (1)   No emergency order shall be issued unless a time and place for
hearing on temporary order is designated in the order;
      (2)   The hearing on the temporary emergency order shall be held within
ten days following the issuance of the temporary order, unless continued by the
Commission at the request of the respondent. At that hearing the complainant
shall show that a failure to continue the temporary order would damage his or
her remedy. The Commission shall thereupon weigh the comparative hardship to
complainant and respondent and issue a decision continuing or terminating the
temporary emergency order, pending final deposition of the complaint. If the
respondent waives that hearing without prejudice to his or her defense of the
matters charged in the complaint, the temporary order shall remain in effect
pending final disposition of the complaint;
      (3)   The Commission may by rule provide for issuance of its temporary
order and may compel compliance with any temporary order by bringing an action
in the County Circuit or Superior Court for prohibitory or mandatory injunction
upon showing that the person is subject to the Court’s jurisdiction, resides or
transacts business within the city, the proceeding is brought and that the
injunction is necessary to protect the complainant’s rights until his or her
complaint is resolved through conciliation or public hearing;
   (J)   To reduce the terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties a written
consent agreement, which the parties and a majority of the Commission shall
sign. When so signed, the consent agreement shall have the same effect as a
cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (L) below. If the Commission
determines that a party to the consent agreement is not complying with it, the
Commission may obtain enforcement of the consent agreement in the County
Circuit or Superior Court upon showing that the party is not complying with the
consent agreement, that the party is subject to the Commissions’s jurisdiction
and resides or transacts business within the city;
   (K)   (1)   To hold hearings, administer oaths, take testimony of any person
under oath, subpoena the attendance of witnesses and the production for
examination of all pertinent documents and records relating to any matter under
investigation or in question before the Commission, examine witnesses, appoint
a hearing officer or panel, make findings and recommendations, issue cease and
desist orders requiring remedial action and institute actions for appropriate
legal or equitable relief in the County Circuit or Superior Court. The
Commission shall make rules governing the issuance of subpoenas by individual
commissioners. Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena or temporary emergency
order issued under this subchapter shall be deemed an ordinance violation. Any
person who commits such an ordinance violation shall, upon conviction, be fined
as set forth in §
10.99.
      (2)   Each day any violation continues shall be deemed a separate
offense. Any fines collected under this subchapter shall be deposited in the
City General Fund. The payment of that penalty by a party shall not impair the
ability of the Commission to grant affirmative relief and compensatory damages
to the complainant, should justice so require.
   (L)   Enforcement:
      (1)   To state its findings of fact after hearing and, if a majority of
the Commissioners who hear the case finds that a person has engaged in a
discriminatory practice prohibited by this subchapter, the Commission shall
cause to be served on the person an order requiring the person to cease and
desist from that discriminatory practice and requiring that person to take
further affirmative action necessary to effectuate the purpose of this
subchapter;

§ 37.30 JOB ANALYSIS.

of which job classifications within each department are underutilized as to
minorities, females, handicapped persons or persons over 40 years of age. If
the Affirmative Action Officer determines that a job classification within a
department has such a small population that consideration of that
classification within the department by itself is not justified for the purpose
of this subchapter, he or she may combine the populations of several
classifications within one or more departments, as long as the duties and
levels or responsibility of the combined classifications are substantially
similar.

having requisite skills in the reasonable recruiting area, when data regarding
that factor is available;
      (5)   The availability of persons in the special segment group having
requisite skills in an area in which the city can reasonably recruit;
      (6)   The availability of promotable and transferable persons within the
special segment group within the work force employed by the city;
      (7)   The existence of training institutions capable of training persons
in the requisite skills;
      (8)   The degree of training which the city is reasonably able to
undertake as to means of making all job classifications available to persons in
the special segment group.
   (D)   The Affirmative Action Officer shall provide each department head with
a list of all underutilized jobs within his or her department.
   (E)   The Affirmative Action Officer shall utilize the information provided
to him or her to maintain a current list of underutilized jobs between
semiannual analysis.
   (F)   The Affirmative Action Officer and the Director shall establish
semiannual quantitative, attainable goals for hiring and promotion for each job
classification on each department which is determined to be underutilized for
any special segment group by the Affirmative Action Officer as a result of his
or her semiannual utilization analysis. These goals shall be formulated so that
if they are met, each classification in each department shall be fully utilized
for each special segment group by January 16, 1985.
   (G)   The results of the utilization analysis and the goals set shall be
presented by the Director to a regular Council meeting.

increase the participation of special segment group persons on boards or
committees concerned with promotions, grievances and hiring.
   (C)   Any department head who intends to subject any employee to involuntary
separation and disciplinary action shall inform the Affirmative Action Officer
of the intended action and the detailed reasons for it. The Affirmative Action
Officer shall review that intended action and the justification asserted for it
and shall make an independent determination of whether that action is
justified. If the Affirmative Action Officer finds that the action is not
justified, he or she shall submit reasons for reconsideration to the Mayor and
the department head. The decision of the Mayor will be final.
   (D)   The Affirmative Action Officer and each department head shall assure
that physical facilities, job placement and work are assigned on a non-
discriminatory and non-segregated basis.
   (E)   Each department head shall designate employees with appropriate
abilities as training counselors to help new employees adjust to the work
environment.

   (A)   The Personnel Director and the Affirmative Action Officer shall, based
on the job descriptions established under
§ 37.30, establish or review the qualifications required for each new job
classification and the selection criteria used in choosing employees for each
job classification from the applicants for employment.
   (B)   The Personnel Director and the Coordinator shall determine which
qualification requirements and selection criteria for all job qualifications
and selection criteria, other than licenses or certifications which are
required by law to perform any classification and any requirements necessary to
obtain those licenses and certificates tend to adversely affect underutilized
persons. These determinations shall be based on census data gathered by the
United States Bureau of the Census, prior experience of the city in hiring
employees or other reliable sources.
   (C)   The Personnel Director and the Affirmative Action Officer shall
eliminate each job qualification or selection criterion identified as tending
to exclude a special segment group, unless it can be demonstrated that:
      (1)   The qualification or criterion is necessary for the safe and
efficient performance of the job; and
      (2)   There are no other qualifications or criterion which could be
substituted for it which would also tend to predict that an applicant would
perform the job safely and efficiently and which would tend to exclude fewer
persons in the special segment group.
   (D)   When tests are used for selection, promotion or other decisions
relating to a potential employee or existing employee, those tests shall be
validated EEOC approved tests. These tests shall be administrated relative to
EEOC guidelines.
(1985 Code, § 22-9-3-1(i)) (Ord. 16-1980, passed 9-2-1980)
§ 37.34 MATERNITY LEAVE.
   The city shall not impose an arbitrary time during pregnancy at which a

disability leave policy or by a statement from the employee’s attending
physician.

   (B)   The following procedures shall be used in the recruitment of city
employees:
      (1)   All employment advertising, job announcements and recruiting
brochures shall identify the city as an “Equal Opportunity Employer;”
      (2)   All employment advertising and recruiting activities, including
contacts with employment sources, schools, colleges and training institutions
shall be directed to all qualified applicants regardless of race, color, creed,
sex, age, handicap, national origin, political affiliation or religion;
      (3)   Discriminatory or unnecessary restrictions due to age, sex,
physical characteristics, education and experience shall be deleted from all
recruiting announcements. Only bona fide requirements shall be specified;

qualifications, personalized mailing shall be sent to placement officers of
colleges and universities with a predominance of special segment group

encouraged on the part of special segment group employees to facilitate the
recruitment of special segment group applicants;
      (6)   Job announcements shall be issued in readable and understandable

§ 37.37 SELECTION.
   (A)   Once recruitment has been completed, the vacant position shall be
filled by using the whole list certification process. This process requires
that all applicants for the position who meet minimum qualifications and are
identified through recruitment activity shall be given equal consideration,
including the interviewing of each candidate. The best applicant shall
subsequently be chosen with emphasis on overcoming underutilization. If a
person from the special segment group is not chosen by the appointing authority
in an underutilized job classification, the appointing authority shall submit
in writing why a special segment person has not been selected. That written
documentation shall be retained for a period of three years.
   (B)   Before any applicant is notified of employment, the Affirmative Action
Officer shall review all applications and the appointing authority’s interview
form to determine if the candidate for the vacant position was chosen on the

action against the party accused and request the Mayor to override the
discriminatory hiring decision.

Promotional and Miscellaneous Account. The City Council is authorized to budget
and appropriate funds from the revenues of the water and sewer utility to pay
the expenses incurred in promoting the betterment of the City of Marion,
Indiana, through the accounts created.
   (B)   Expenditures from these accounts may include, but are not necessarily
limited to, the following:
      (1)   Membership dues and local, regional, state and national
associations of a civic, educational or governmental nature, which have as
their purpose the betterment and improvement of municipal utility operations;
      (2)   Direct expenses for travel, meals and lodging in conjunction with
municipal business or meetings or organizations to which the municipal utility
belongs;

development for the municipality, including meeting room rental, decorations,
lodging, meals and travel;
      (4)   Commemorative plaques, certificates or objects such as

Utility Service Board. Claims for expenses under this section will be allowed

(Ord. 5-1985, passed 3-5-1985)
§ 38.04 TAX ABATEMENT GUIDELINE SUPPORT.
   (A)   Manufacturing/Industrial based projects should be considered for the
maximum abatement schedule allowed under Indiana State Code - ten years on real
property and on personal property (equipment). An abatement should not exceed
the useful life of personal property. This preference for manufacturing/
industrial based projects needs to be shown in order to induce and encourage
industrial enhancements of the community. High tech, or technologically based
industries, should be included in this classification.
   (B)   Commercial abatements should be considered for no more six years,
unless an unusually large and impactful benefit to the community can be
demonstrated. Under normal commercial development circumstances, six year
abatement scheduled should be considered only in geographic areas where the
abatement incentive is needed to encourage development. These areas could
include the central business district (downtown area), the Urban Enterprise
Zone, the South Marion Business District, or similar areas. The by-pass,
interstate exchange, and similar areas should be considered for no more than
three year abatement schedules. Variables that should be considered when
determining the appropriate tax abatement schedule for commercial projects
include: number of new and permanent full-time jobs being created, wage scale
of positions being created, geographic location, level of investment,
additional municipal services required, and overall positive impact on the
community.
   (C)   Residential tax abatements should be offered for no more than three
years. Special consideration should be given to new sub-division development,
due to the private infrastructure development for the city, and to urban in-
fill projects, for making a more efficient use of existing municipal services.
Even in these two areas, however, tax abatement scheduled should not exceed
three years. Rehabilitation and repair of existing structures may be eligible
for up to five years of tax abatement if it qualifies under Indiana law by
substantially increasing the assessed valuation. Routine maintenance such as
painting, re-shingling, etc. shall not qualify for tax abatement unless it
results in a substantial increase in the assessed valuation.
   (D)   Please note that any tax abatement guidelines should be used as
general procedural statements only. The city council should maintain a certain
level of flexibility in its program in order to best serve the citizens of
Marion. It could be harmful to lock into a rigid formula. All abatements should
be considered on a case-by-case basis in order to ensure the efficient use of
the tax abatement program. High priority shall be given to job creation as well
as job retention. Whenever possible, the Common Council shall be allowed
sufficient time to study and examine a proposed tax abatement. Thus, as a
general rule, tax abatements should not be heard by the Common Council on the
same night as it is heard by committee, unless there is an emergency.
   (E)   The Abatement committee is designated as the City Council's
negotiating arm on the issue of tax abatement. The abatement committee may make
recommendations outside of these guidelines in exceptional circumstances. This
resolution shall be reviewed and evaluated at least annually.

by the individual tract owner shall be submitted, with the appropriate fee, for
review to the Mayor or his or her designee who will then forward it to the
President of the City Council with a recommendation that it either be accepted
or rejected.
      (2)   If the Mayor or his or her designee recommend acceptance and the
President of the City Council agrees, he or she may approve the statement of
benefits by simply signing the same and the tax abatement will go into effect.
      (3)   If either the Mayor's designee or the president of the City Council
feels the abatement should not be granted or would like the application
reviewed by the entire Council, the matter shall be referred to the entire City
Council for consideration on its merits as any other tax abatement would be.
   (B)   If the City Council authorizes the streamlined procedure, then all
tracts in the economic development target area so designated shall be available
to apply for the city's three-year tax abatement on those tracts for a period
of up to five years from the granting date, with such three-year abatement to
run for three years after it is granted.
   (C)   The residential developer may extend the period of designation as an
economic target development area beyond the initial five-year period by appeal
directly to the entire City Council in the fourth year of the designation, the
Council may grant an extension of time for the designation at it's discretion.
   (D)   The Mayor or his or her designee shall report to the full Council each
quarter to provide information on each parcel approved under the streamlined
procedure including the common address, owner, and value property abated.

premises shall be deemed an ordinance violation as to all. The Utility may
enforce compliance with this chapter by shutting off the supply of water to
all; however, that action shall not be taken until the customer not in
violation of this chapter has been given written notice and a reasonable
opportunity to attach his or her service pipe, at his or her own expense to a
separately controlled curb stop.
   (K)   A new service pipe between the distribution main and a building shall
be run in a direct line whenever it is practicable and possible without bends
and at a depth of not less than four and one-half feet.
   (L)   No pipe having joints shall be driven. Service pipes shall not be laid
in the same trench with sewers or any other conduit unless written approval has
been given by the Utilities Engineering Department.
   (M)   New service lines shall be connected directly to a water distribution
main, which is immediately adjacent to the property requesting service. If an
adequate distribution main is not available immediately adjacent to the
property requesting service the property owner shall petition for a water main
extension in accordance with §
51.36.

or other deterioration. If replacement is necessary due to increased demand by
the customer, that replacement shall be at the customer's expense.
   (B)   The service pipe and its fixtures from the curb stop to the building
served, the meter excepted, shall be maintained at the expense of the customer
or owner of the property. Any leaks or other defects in the pipe or fixture
shall be promptly repaired by the customer or owner. A service line or private
main extended to property not adjacent to a utility water main, whether
extended through public or private property, shall be maintained by the
customer or owner, unless that line or main has been accepted in writing for
maintenance by the Utility. If needed repairs are not made to that service line
or private main within seven days of written notification by the Utility, the
customer or property owner may be charged $5 per day for each day following
that seven day period of grace that the water leak or other defect is allowed
to continue.
   (C)   All meter boxes and lids shall be maintained in good repair by the
owner at his or her expense. In the event that the shut-off is located inside
the meter pit, the Utility shall maintain the service pipe up to the shut-off
valve on the inlet side of the yoke and shall also furnish and maintain the
meter. The owner shall maintain the meter yoke and service pipe leading from
the outlet side of the yoke and shall be responsible for all changes in grade
or location of the meter box.

§ 51.27 CROSS CONNECTIONS.
   No customer shall allow or cause the construction or maintenance of a cross
connection. A cross connection is any physical arrangement, including non-
working cross connection control devices, whereby a public water supply is
directly connected, either continuously or intermittently, with any
contaminated or otherwise un-potable liquid or material that may be imparted to
the public water supply. The policy of Marion Utility Service Board (MUSB)
further addresses cross connection and backflow hazards, application and
installation requirements, testing, inspection, and compliance issues in
keeping with the Indiana Administrative Code, as further referenced therein.
The Cross Connection Control Policy of MUSB is hereby incorporated by reference
into this section. MUSB does not assume responsibility for damage, sickness, or
death arising from the existence of a cross connection or from the use or
failure of a backflow prevention device, whether approved or not approved.

§ 51.30 METERING.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified in the contract between the Utility and
the customer or by the tariff on file, the water supplied shall be measured by
a meter or meters of standard manufacture, furnished and installed by the
Utility in accordance with current standards. The customer shall provide for
this purpose, free from expense to the Utility, a suitable place near the
service entrance either in the basement in an approved meter box or in a
location, which is approved by the Utility before installation.
      (2)   The Utility shall designate the size of the meter to be used for
serving any customer. Each building to be served directly from the main must be
supplied by at least a three-quarter inch ID service. If the service is larger
than this, the Utility reserves the right to designate the number of meters
that can be supplied by that service.
      (3)   All meters or other appliances and equipment which are furnished by
and at the expense of the Utility and which may at any time be on the
customer's premises shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by this chapter,
be and remain the property of the Utility. The customer shall protect that
property from freezing and from any loss or damage. No person except a
representative of the Utility shall remove that property or tamper with it.
      (4)   Ordinary repairs shall be made by the Utility without expense to
the customer. Repairs of damage caused by carelessness or neglect by the
customer shall also be made by the Utility but the cost of those repairs shall
be charged to the customer.
      (5)   A meter shall be tested for accuracy if the customer requests it.
If the test establishes the accuracy of the meter to be within 98% and 102% the
Utility shall charge the customer $5 for making the testing. The customer may
have a representative present when the meter is tested.
(1985 Code, § 36-9-2-14(r))
   (B)   Inability to read meter. If the Utility is unable to gain access to an
inside meter setting in order to obtain a reading for one full year, the
Utility shall send the customer a letter requesting arrangements for access
within regular working hours or service will be discontinued.
(1985 Code, § 36-9-2-14(dd)) (Ord. 4-1980, passed 3-18-1980; Am. Ord. 32-2006,

§ 51.31 BASIS FOR BILLING.
   (A)   All charges for water usage, other than for un-metered fire service or
other special purposes, shall be calculated upon the registration of the meter
or meters installed.
   (B)   The Utility shall make every effort to read industrial, residential
and commercial meters on a regular basis. Those readings shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount of water used. If a meter fails to measure accurately or
is not read for any reason, the customer shall be billed an estimated charge
based on the average of the previous billings. The first billing made after the
meter is read shall be adjusted according to the meter reading.
   (C)   If water is taken through more than one meter, and if that arrangement
is for the convenience of the customer, then each meter shall be read and
billed separately. If water is taken through more than one meter for the
convenience of the Utility, then the meter readings shall be aggregated and
billed as one reading.
   (D)   All water passing through meters shall be charged for, whether used,
wasted or lost through leakage. However, the MUSB may, at its discretion,
adjust individual customer water charges for hidden leaks. A hidden leak is
defined as: any leak which in ordinary usage cannot be detected by loss of
pressure, sound, or sight of running water.

§ 51.32 DENIAL OR DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE.
   (A)   Denial of service. The Utility reserves the right to refuse an
application for service if the applicant is indebted to the Utility for prior
service rendered at any location. The Utility shall make known to the applicant
the reason for that refusal. The Utility shall also refuse to turn water
service on to a property having delinquent sewer service charges outstanding.
   (B)   Discontinuance without notice.
      (1)   The Utility reserves the right to discontinue service without
notice to any customer:
         (a)   When an emergency exists.
         (b)   For unauthorized use of water.
         (c)   For an unapproved cross connection of a customer's water pipes
to any other source of water supply or for permitting any condition to exist
about his or her premises that causes or might cause pollution of the public
water supply.
         (d)   Upon order of any authority having jurisdiction of that matter.
         (e)   For any tampering or knowingly permitting any tampering with any
service pipe, curb stop, meter or meter seal.
         (f)   For any fraudulent representation or concealment related to
consumption for use of water.
      (2)   Water service discontinued for any of the foregoing reasons shall
be renewed immediately and without charge, except for a charge for the
estimated loss of water revenue in items (e) and (f) above, to a customer upon
the correction of the condition causing the discontinuance.
   (C)   Discontinuance after five-day notice.
      (1)   The Utility reserves the right to discontinue all water service to
all or any part of the premises of a customer who has been given at least five
days written notice, either mailed to him or her at his or her address as shown
on the records of the Utility or delivered personally to him or her or to a
person on his or her premises, that his or her water service shall be
discontinued in whole or in part if any situation as listed below continues:
         (a)   Delinquency in the customer's account with the Utility in
connection with charges for water or sewer service supplied, meter or service
maintenance or contractual payment for facilities.
         (b)   Failure to provide and maintain an adequate cash deposit
guaranteeing payment of water and sewer bills as requested by the Utility.
         (c)   Wastage of water due to a leak in a privately owned water main,
service pipe or appurtenance between the curb stop and the meter, in a private
fire protection system or in any other un-metered facility connected directly
or indirectly to the Utility's distribution mains.
         (d)   Failure to maintain free and non-hazardous access to the
premises and to the water meter so that representatives of the Utility may take
meter readings, make all necessary inspections and maintain, replace or remove
the meter.
         (e)   Failure to maintain an approved meter setting, including pits
and vaults.
         (f)   Installing a new service pipe and appurtenances and altering or
removing existing service pipes and appurtenances including the meter without
the written authority of the Utility.
         (g)   Vacancy of premises.
         (h)   Violation of any provision of this chapter.
      (2)   Water service discontinued for one of the foregoing reasons shall
be renewed by the Utility upon application when the conditions under which that
service was discontinued has been corrected, when all charges to the customer
have been paid, and when access to the premises may be had during regular
working hours. A charge commensurate with the cost of turning off and turning
on the service may be made. If shutting off or renewing the service involves
any excavating, the cost of that work shall be an additional charge against the
customer.
   (D)   Whenever the Utility has turned off a water service, the customer
shall not turn it back on nor shall he or she cause any other person to turn
such service on.
   (E)   The discontinuance of service shall not terminate a contract between
the customer and the Utility nor shall it abrogate any minimum charge, which
may be effective. The remedies provided the Utility in this chapter shall not
be exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies, which the Utility
has at law or in equity.

§ 51.35 PRIVATE FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE.
   (A)   The entire private fire protection service on a customer's premises
shall be subject to inspection and tests by the Utility at such times, as it
deems necessary.
   (B)   Before any modifications are made to any private fire service
protection system or before service is furnished to any new private fire
protection system connected to or proposed to be connected to and supplied with
water from the Utility's distribution mains, final plans of that fire
protection system shall be filed with and approved by the Utility Engineering
Department. The following shall be shown on the final plans:
      (1)   The number of sprinkler heads to be served;
      (2)   The sizes and location of the system piping;
      (3)   The sizes and locations of all connections to the Utility's
distribution mains;
      (4)   The sizes and locations of all valves;
      (5)   The sizes and locations of all hose connections, reels or cabinets;
      (6)   The sizes and locations of storage tanks connected to the fire
system; and
      (7)   The outlet sizes and locations of all fire hydrants.
   (C)   All fire protection lines within buildings shall be installed so that
all pipes shall be easily accessible for inspection at any time. Underground
pipes outside of buildings shall be placed and maintained at a minimum depth of
four and one-half feet. All private fire protection lines, hydrants and
metering facilities shall be maintained by and at the expense of the customer.
   (D)   No connection with a fire protection system shall be permitted to
supply water for general purposes unless the connection has been approved by
the customer's fire underwriter and unless the general-purpose water is
metered. If such a connection is approved, it shall be made outside the
building to be served. Both the fire protection line and the general purpose
line shall be separately valved in accordance with the Utility's specifications
to permit either to be turned on or off without affecting the other.
   (E)   A private fire protection system without a tank shall be equipped with
an alarm valve and a check valve. A system with a tank shall have one alarm
valve and two check valves.
   (F)   An un-metered private fire service is furnished for the sole purpose
of supplying water for the extinguishments of accidental fires and the use of
water from such a service connection for any other purpose shall be deemed an
ordinance violation.
   (G)   Hydrants and other fixtures connected to a private fire service
connection may be sealed by the Utility. That seal shall be broken only in case
of fire or as specially permitted by the Utility. The customer shall
immediately notify the Utility when any such seal is broken.
   (H)   Where a service tap on a Utility distribution main provides water for
both fire and general purposes to a customer or customers, separate charges
will be made for each purpose to each customer by the Utility in accordance
with the established rules and schedule of rates.
   (I)   A private fire service, at the option of the customer and after the
approval of his or her fire underwriter, may be connected to his or her metered
water service. The minimum monthly charge for those combined fire and general-
purpose uses shall be as set out in this chapter.
   (J)   Any additional investment cost incurred by the Utility in that
metering shall be paid by the customer. Maintenance of the general water
service meter will be at the expense of the Utility.
   (K)   If a private fire system is to be tested under the regulations of the
fire service underwriters, the customer shall notify the Utility of that
proposed test, stating the day and the hour when it is to be made, so the
Utility may have a representative present for the test.

§ 51.36 INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE.
   The Utility shall not be responsible in damages for any failure to supply
water service or for interruption of the supply of water, or for defective
piping on the customer's premises, or for damages resulting to a customer or to
third persons through the use of water or the presence of the Utility's devices
on the customer's premises, unless due to fault, negligence or culpability on
the part of the Utility. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any
failure or delay in case that failure or delay caused by strikes, the acts of
nature, unavoidable accidents or contingencies beyond its control and not due
to fault, neglect or culpability on its part.

§ 51.37 WATER MAIN EXTENSION POLICY.
   (A)   If any person desiring service from the Utility requests a water main
extension, that person shall pay for the cost of the extension. The purpose of
this requirement is to place the cost of the installation of local water mains
upon the owners of the properties benefitted. Water transmission mains, feeder
mains and over-sizing of local water mains will be paid for by the Utility
providing funds are available. The term LOCAL WATER MAIN means a main, which
from its size and character, is designed and intended to supply water needs,
with adequate volumes and pressures only for properties abutting the street,
alley, easement or other public land in which the main is laid but which is not
designed and intended to feed collateral mains necessary to supply non-abutting
properties.
   (B)   This extension requirement shall be subject to the specific provisions
of the following division:
      (1)   Free extensions. The Utility shall, upon written request for
service from a prospective customer or a group of prospective customers located
in the same neighborhood, make free of charge an extension necessary to give
service to the petitioning prospective customers when the total estimated
revenue for a period of six years, from the prospective customer or customers
is approximately equal to the cost of the extension, if, in the judgment of the
Utility, the patronage or demand for water service shall be of a permanent
nature warranting the expenditure involved.
      (2)   Extension above free limit. If the extension required in order to
furnish service at any point within the city limits, or for any suburb adjacent
or contiguous to those limits, is greater than the free extension specified in
this division, that extension should be made if:
         (a)   Petition for service. Upon the presentation of a written
petition for water service by an interested person or persons, the Utility
shall enter into an agreement with those petitioners covering the necessary
main extension, describing the installation, the method of apportioning costs
among the petitioners, the total estimated cost if possible and other relevant
facts and undertakings. This agreement shall contain a statement by the
petitioners that they are willing to pay their proportionate share of the main
extension if the project is constructed. Detailed engineering design shall not
proceed if the petitioners do not agree to pay the necessary cost of the
extension over and above the free limit as described in this division. The
petition shall be valid for one year. An extension of time may be granted by
the Utility. Preliminary engineering investigations shall be conducted at the
Utility's expense for the benefit of petitioners. If those investigations
require an excessive amount of time and cost in the judgment of the Utility
Manager, a charge shall be applied to cover the cost prior to that initiating
work.
         (b)   Engineering and detailed cost estimate. When the petitioners
agree in writing to pay their proportionate share of the main extension, the
Utility shall conduct the necessary field survey work and engineering design
resulting in a detailed engineers' estimate of the cost of the project. Based
upon the engineers' estimate, the project cost shall be allotted
proportionately between the petitioners.
         (c)   Contract for service. Upon completion of the engineers'
estimate, the Utility shall enter into a water main extension contract with
said petitioners, which shall include a description of the installation, the
estimated cost, the method of apportioning costs among the petitioners, and an
arrangement for payment and other relevant facts and undertakings.
         (d)   Initial deposit. Prior to advertising for bids or starting
construction as the case may be, the petitioners shall be required to deposit
their share of the cost of the main extension with the Utility. The total
initial deposit may be either in a cash payment or by an irrevocable letter of
credit acceptable to the Utility and issued by a national banking association
or a bank chartered under state law or secured in any other manner which is
mutually acceptable to the parties and which guarantees payment of the deposit
immediately upon completion of construction of the extension. When the total
initial deposit has been made, the Utility shall advertise for bids on the
project, award the bid and begin construction. Upon receipt of firm bid prices,
the estimated project cost shall be adjusted to actual and the cost to the
petitioners adjusted accordingly.
         (e)   Cost basis. The amount to be paid by petitioners for a main
extension shall be the total costs of contractual labor and expense, utility
labor and expense, material including handling charges and hauling costs,
inspection, testing, disinfecting, overhead and engineering. Where feasible,
petitioners may, by agreement with the Utility, furnish all or part of the
foregoing cost elements, except inspection and testing. All those cost elements
furnished shall conform to the standards of the Utility and the Utility shall
be given certified statements of the actual costs of those elements paid for by
the petitioner.
         (f)   Engineering and over-sizing. Main extension design and
specifications shall either be prepared by the Utility Engineering Department
or be approved by the Utility Engineer before installation by others. No pipe
size smaller than that required to give that party an adequate supply of water
including water for fire protection, nor less than eight inches in diameter
shall be used, unless in the Utility's opinion, that installation shall not
materially improve the flow characteristics of the system. If the design for
future use or other engineering considerations indicate the need for a water
main larger than eight inches, then the Utility shall assume the cost for over-
sizing if funds are available. The computation of cost, either actual or
estimated, shall be based on an eight inch main, unless a larger or smaller
main as determined by the Utility, is reasonably necessary to serve the
proposed customer or customers, including fire protection service. In this
event the cost, estimated or actual, shall be based on the size of main
required.
         (g)   Ownership of mains. After completion and acceptance by the
Utility, the water main extension shall become the property of and shall be
maintained by the Utility. The Utility may connect additional water mains to an
extension without incurring any financial obligations to persons sharing the
cost of the first extension.
         (h)   Refund provision. The contact between the Utility and the
original petitioners shall provide that any person who did not share the
original cost of the extension and who wishes to use the extension within 15
years from the date of the acceptance of that extension shall be required to
pay a fair and proportionate share of the original cost of the extension. The
amount of the share collected from such new customer shall be based on a fixed
connection charge as follows:
TAP  CONNECTION FEE
SIZE
TAP                   CONNECTION FEE
SIZE
3/4 inch connection   $800
1 inch connection     $1000
1-1/2 inch connection $1200
2 inch connection     $1400
2-1/2 inch connection $1600
3 inch connection     $2000
4 inch connection     $3000
6 inch connection     $4000
8 inch connection     $6000
10 inch connection    $8000
12 inch connection    $10,000
 
This additional share shall be refunded equitably to the original depositors
annually or more frequently at the discretion of the Utility. The total amount
refunded shall not exceed the amount of the original cost of the extension.
         (i)   Exclusion of new subdivisions.
            1.   New subdivisions shall be excluded from eligibility for refund
agreements. The developer shall pay the entire cost of the necessary water main
construction and recover the cost in the lot price.
            2.   Water main extensions from the terminus of existing water
mains to the subdivision, which would be subject to future connections, are
eligible for refund agreements.
         (j)   Recording extension contracts. To insure collection of share and
connection charges for those providing funds for local water main
installations, the Utility shall file the original water main extension
contracts with the County Recorder.
         (k)   Waiver of protest to annexation. Petitioners for water main
extensions and water service outside the city limits shall be required to
execute a written agreement that the owner and his or her successors in title
and assigns waive any rights to remonstrate against or otherwise object to,
interfere with or oppose any pending or future annexation by the city as a
condition of receiving that water main extension and water service for that
property.
         (l)   Lateral extensions. The Utility may connect additional water
mains to an extension without incurring any financial obligation to person
sharing the cost of the first extension. However, the Utility shall not permit
a prospective customer whose property is contiguous to the first extension to
obtain service from an additional extension installed laterally from that first
extension unless the customer pays a proportionate share of the cost of the
first extension. The Utility shall collect in advance from the owner of that
property a fixed connection charge as follows:
 
TAP                   CONNECTION FEE
SIZE
3/4 inch connection   $800
1 inch connection     $1000
1-1/2 inch connection $1200
 
TAP                   CONNECTION FEE
SIZE
2 inch connection     $1400
2-1/2 inch connection $1600
3 inch connection     $2000
4 inch connection     $3000
6 inch connection     $4000
8 inch connection     $6000
10 inch connection    $8000
12 inch connection    $10,000
 
This additional lateral connection fee shall be refunded to the original
depositors annually or more frequently at the discretion of the Utility. The
total amount refunded shall not exceed the original cost of the extension.

blowdown wastewater);
         (b)   Contributes a process wastestream which makes up 5% or more of
the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment
plant; or
         (c)   Is designated as such by the Board on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   The Board may determine that a user subject to categorical
pretreatment standards is a NSCIU rather than a SIU on a finding that the user
never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical
wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown
wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the
following conditions are met:
         (a)   The user, prior to Board's finding, has consistently complied

(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.016 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users must comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40
CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. Effluent limitations promulgated by
the federal act shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent than
those in this chapter. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR
Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and any future promulgated regulations
are hereby incorporated.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Board may impose
equivalent mass limits in accordance with §
52.016(D) and 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Board shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   (C)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   (D)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a CIU may request that the Board convert the limits
to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to
mass limits is within the discretion of the Board. The Board may establish
equivalent mass limits only if the CIU meets all the conditions set forth in 40
CFR 403.6(c)(5).
   (E)   Once included in its permit, the CIU must comply with the equivalent
limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical
standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (F)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (G)   Any CIU operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass limits
calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the Board within two
business days after the CIU has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any CIU not
notifying the Board of such anticipated change will be required to meet the
mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
   (H)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Board may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to CIUs.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.017 STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   A user shall comply with state pretreatment standards applicable to the
user. If the state pretreatment standards are less stringent than the national
pretreatment standards or local limits applicable to the user, the user shall
comply with the more stringent standards. The state pretreatment standards, as
amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference into this
chapter.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.018 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The Board is authorized to establish local limits, by ordinance,
order, in wastewater discharge permits, in other control documents, or in other
notice to the user, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). The local limits allocation
for a given pollutant shall not exceed the most recent calculated maximum
allowable industrial loading for that pollutant. Local limits may be allocated
to any user whose discharge exceeds or has the potential to exceed the most
recent calculated domestic background concentrations.
   (B)   Local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the POTW or as specified in the SIU wastewater discharge permit or other
control document. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total
metal unless indicated otherwise. The Board may impose mass or concentration-
based limitations.
   (C)   The Board may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs) for any SIU or
other user, as needed, to implement this chapter. BMPs may be implemented
through a wastewater discharge permit, other control document, order, or other
notice to the user. BMPs are pretreatment standards and enforceable under this
chapter.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.019 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The Board reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.020 DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Board may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.021 DISCRETIONARY ACTION.
   Where circumstances so warrant the Board may agree to arrangements with
users which modify the terms of this chapter if that arrangement complies with
the NPDES permit of the Board and all other federal and state laws and
regulations governing the operation of the wastewater treatment plant.

§ 52.040 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the event that a user is exceeding the limitations as set forth in
§§
52.015 through
52.021, the Board shall direct the user causing the discharge of any such
materials to cease and desist from those activities or operations which cause a
violation of established discharge standards or to provide wastewater treatment
as necessary to comply with this chapter and to achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §§
52.015 through
52.021 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the board,
whichever is more stringent.
   (B)   Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated,
and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Board for review, and shall
be acceptable to the Board before such facilities are constructed. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the Board under the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Any facility classified as an industrial treatment plant per 327 IAC
5-22 shall meet the operator certification requirements in accordance with 327
IAC 5-22, as amended.

   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Board may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from other facility wastestreams, and
such other conditions as maybe necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Board may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and
flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge
permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
unless a waiver is granted by the Board (normally not applicable to residential
dwellings). All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Board and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the
user at their expense. Such interceptors shall be maintained such that the user
does not violate the pretreatment standards in this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Waste from garbage grinders shall not be discharged into a
sanitary sewer except:
         (a)   Wastes generated in preparation of food normally consumed on the
premises; or
         (b)   Where the user has obtained authorization for that specific use
from the Board, and agreed to undertake whatever self-monitoring is required to
enable the Board to equitably determine the user charges based on the waste
constituents and characteristics.
      (2)   These grinders shall shred the waste so that all particles shall be
carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the sanitary sewer.
Garbage grinders shall not be used for grinding plastic, paper products, inert
materials or garden refuse.
   (E)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

52.015 through
52.021. Those facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's
expense.
   (B)   The Board shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The Board may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and
implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to
control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Board may develop such a plan for
any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at
a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Board of any accidental or

(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.103 SIU PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   All SIUs must, at a frequency determined by the Board submit no less
than twice per year (June and December, or on dates specified) reports
indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are
limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative,
the SIU must submit documentation required by the Board or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the SIU.
   (B)   The Board may authorize a CIU to forego sampling of a pollutant
regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the CIU has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the CIU (see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)). This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the SIU wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer
than five years. The CIU must submit a new request for the waiver before the
waiver can be granted for each subsequent SIU wastewater discharge permit.
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the CIU
must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with the definition of authorized or duly authorized representative of the user
§
52.004, and include the certification statement in §
52.113(A) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(H)).
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results maybe used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Board must be included as
a condition in the CIU's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and
any information submitted by the CIU in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Board for three years after expiration of the waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the CIU's
permit by the Board, the CIU must certify on each report with the statement in
§
52.113(C) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the CIU.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the CIU's operations,
the CIU must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of §
52.103(A), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Board,
and notify the Board.
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards/except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (C)   All SIU periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
52.113(A).
   (D)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (E)   If a SIU subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently
than required by the Board, using the procedures prescribed in §
52.133, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.104 NON-CIU COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE REPORTS.
   Any non-CIU which is not in compliance with this chapter shall develop a
compliance schedule by which time the user shall meet the discharge
prohibitions or requirements in §§
52.015 through
52.021. The schedule should contain increments of progress, which correspond to
specific dates for their completion. All users subject to these conditions
shall submit a progress report to the Board no later than 14 days following
each date in the compliance schedule. This report shall state if it complies
with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if
the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no
event shall more than six months elapse between progress reports.

   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, any user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Board of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Board, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   SIUs are also required to notify the Board immediately of any changes
at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.108 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Board within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Board within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the user is not required if the Board performs sampling at the
user's facility at least once a month, or if the Board performs sampling at the
user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when
the user or the Board receives the results of this sampling, or if the Board
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the user. If the Board
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the user, the Board will perform
the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation
and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.109 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. The user
shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the discharge. All
notifications to EPA and the state must take place no later than 180 days after
the discharge commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under §
52.105. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.100,
52.102 and
52.103.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Board, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

SAMPLING AND COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.130 REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE.
   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.131 CONTROL MANHOLE.
   All users who discharge pollutants other than sewage to the POTW and who
make a new connection or modify an existing connection to the POTW shall
install a control manhole unless the Board determines that a control manhole is
not required. In addition, the Board shall have the authority to require any
user, at the user's expense, to install a control manhole if the Board
determines that such a manhole is necessary to protect the POTW.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.132 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Board or other parties approved by EPA.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.133 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Board. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Board, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Board, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day

§ 52.134 RIGHT OF ENTRY - INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Board shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Board ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Board shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (B)   The Board shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct independent
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (C)   The Board may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy. When the monitoring
facility is constructed in the public right-of-way or easement, in an
unobstructed location, the location of the monitoring facility shall provide
ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples and analysis. Whether constructed on public or private
property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the
Board's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Board and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Board access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.135 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Board has been refused access to a building, structure, or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Board
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, the Board may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Grant
Circuit or Superior Court, Grant County, Indiana.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 52.150 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Board's inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as
confidential information and shall be available to the public without
restriction.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT
REMEDIES
§ 52.170 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, other control
document, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
Within ten days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Board.
Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Board to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.171 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Board may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance, Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
52.173 and
52.174 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.172 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Board may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, other control
document, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Board and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user as defined in §
52.004 and required by §
52.066(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.173 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, other control
document, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Board may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.174 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, other control
document, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Board
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.175 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Board finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, other
control document, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, a fine may be assessed in accordance with Board policy. The
amount of the fine may be determined on an individual basis at the Board's
discretion and in an amount not to exceed the maximum fine allowed under state
law. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the
case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation. Administrative fines are
punitive in nature and are assessed to recapture the full or partial economic
benefit of noncompliance and to deter future violations.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall be assessed in accordance
with current Board policy. A lien against the user's property shall be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Board to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Board may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Board may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.176 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Board may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangermentto the health or welfare of persons. The Board may
also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Board
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Board may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Board that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in §
52.176 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Board prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under §§
52.172 or
52.176.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for. the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
52.015 through
52.021.
      (6)   Failure to comply with administrative enforcement remedies in this
chapter.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
52.172 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Board shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.178 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any user affected by any decision, action or determination, including
cease and desist orders, made by the Board, interpreting or implementing the

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 52.230 CIU UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
CIU. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C), below, are met.
   (C)   A CIU who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the CIU can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The CIU has submitted the following information to the Board within
24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the CIU seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   CIUs shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   CIUs shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.231 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.015(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.015(B)(3) through (7) and (9) through (17) if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Board was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.232 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section,
      (1)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Board, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Board of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Board may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Board may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.

SURCHARGE SAMPLING AND VOLUME DETERMINATIONS
§ 52.250 SAMPLING AND TESTING FOR SURCHARGES OR USER CHARGES.
   (A)   The discharged sewage shall be sampled during each surcharge billing
period for a minimum of a one day period, i.e., 24 hours, by means of a
composite sample. An extended sampling period of up to one week, i.e., seven
continuous days, or reduction may be requested to enable the gathering of a
sample representative of a business' sewage. The extension or reduction of the
sampling period beyond the initial one day sampling period may be requested by
either the sewer user involved or the Board. If an extended sampling period is
requested, the parameter values used to calculate the surcharge shall be the
arithmetical average of the individual values. If a user has multiple
discharges of sewage, each discharge shall be sampled according to quality. The
volume of each discharge shall be determined by actual measurement or by means
of process usage. If significant process changes are made to affect quality of
any discharge, resampling may be requested by either the user involved or the
Board.
   (B)   The sample shall be measured for the following parameters:
Carbonaceous Biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) total suspended solids (TSS) and/
or phosphorus. These tests shall be conducted in accordance with the Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 136, Guideline Establishing Test Procedures
for the Analysis of Pollutants.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.251 DEPOSIT.
   The utility may require from each applicant for wastewater service a cash
deposit of $60 as a guarantee against the non-payment of bills for service.
However, if the applicant is an owner of real property whose credit is approved
by the utility, the deposit may be waived. If the customer's bill remains
unpaid for a period of five days after the date of the final bill or the date
of discontinuance of service, the amount of that bill shall be deducted from
the deposit and the balance, if any, will be remitted to the depositor.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
§ 52.252 WASTEWATER VOLUME DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Metered water supply. User charges and fees shall be based upon the
total amount of water used from all sources unless, in the opinion of the
Board, significant portions of water received are not discharged to a sanitary
sewer. The total amount of water used from public and private sources shall be
determined by means of public meters or private meters, installed and
maintained at the expense of the user and approved by the Board.
   (B)   Metered wastewater volume and metered diversions. For users where, in
the opinion of the Board, a significant portion of the water received from any
material sources does not flow into the sanitary sewer because of the principal
activity of the user or removal by other means, the user charges and fees shall
be applied against the volume of water discharged from such premises into the
sanitary sewer. Written notification and proof of the diversion of water shall
be provided by the user if the user is to avoid the application of the user
charges and fees against the total amount of water used from all sources. The
user may install a meter of a type and at a location approved by the Board and
at the user's expense. These meters may measure either the amount of sewage
discharge or the amount of water diverted. These meters shall be tested for
accuracy at the expense of the user when deemed necessary by the Board.
   (C)   Estimated wastewater volume.
      (1)   Users without source meters. For users where, in the opinion of the
Board, it is unnecessary or impractical to install meters, the quantity of
wastewater may be based upon an estimate prepared by the Board. This estimate
shall be based upon a rational determination of the wastewater discharged and
may consider such factors as the number of fixtures, seating capacity,
population equivalent, annual production of goods and services or such other
determinants of water use necessary to estimate the wastewater volume
discharged.
      (2)   Users with source meters. For users who, in the opinion of the
Board, divert a significant portion of their flow from a sanitary sewer, the
user charges may be based upon:
         (a)   Direct measurement of the diverted flow; or
         (b)   An estimate of the volume prepared by the user provided the user
obtains wastewater discharge authorization and pays the applicable user charges
and fees. The estimate shall include the method and calculations used to
determine the wastewater volume and may consider such factors as the number of
fixtures, seating capacity, population equivalents, annual production of goods
and services, or such other determinations of water use necessary to estimate
the wastewater volume discharged.
(Ord. 9-2016, passed 6-7-2016)
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
§ 52.270 PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.
   The Board may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up
and operating the Board's pretreatment program.

public dedicated or public owned right-of-way shall not be subject to a user
fee.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 53.022 BASE UNITS AND APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The amount of impervious area subject to the user fees shall be
determined by the Board. The Board may make proper allowances in determining
the base units allocable to a user and may round the total amount of impervious
area to always result in base units expressed as a whole figure.
   (B)   Appeal procedure. If, in the opinion of any user, the amount of base
units attributable to such user is inaccurate, the user shall have the right to
contest said calculation in the following manner.
      (1)   The user shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal the amount
of base units, which shall be returned to the Director of Utilities with a copy
of a survey or other verifiable documentation supporting the user's claim.
      (2)   Upon review of the user's claim, the Director of Utilities shall
render a written determination that either the original calculation should be
affirmed or the user should be assigned a new figure of base units. The
Director of Utilities' determination is subject to review by the Board.
      (3)   If the user receives a new figure for base units which is lower
than the original amount assigned to such user, the user shall be credited
accordingly for any overpayment made from the date the original base unit
calculation was implemented; provided, however, that such credit shall not
exceed the overpayment for a period which extends beyond the immediately
preceding 12 calendar months. Said credit shall apply to future service
provided to the user until the overpayment has been fully satisfied. If the
user's petition is denied, said opinion shall be forwarded to the user by
certified mail, return receipt requested. The user shall then have seven days
from date of receipt to request reconsideration by the Board. The user shall
submit a copy of the original petition and supporting documents to the Board
and any additional facts concerning the dispute. The Director of Utilities
shall submit a copy of the determination denying the user's claim, along with
any supporting documents. Thereafter, the Board shall designate a hearing
officer who shall conduct, as soon as practicable, an informal hearing to
determine and resolve the dispute based upon the documentation submitted and
oral testimony of the user. The hearing officer shall render a written decision
at the close of the hearing or within 30 days thereafter. The determination by
such hearing officer shall constitute the final administrative determination
and shall be binding on both parties. The hearing shall be electronically
recorded. A transcript of the hearing shall be provided at a cost of $1 per
page.
      (4)   A party or person aggrieved by the final administrative
determination shall have the right to a judicial review of such determination
in accordance with the provisions of the Indiana Administrative Adjudication
Act.
      (5)   Dispute or appeal of the amount of base units attributable to a
user shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the user fees.

§ 53.023 BILLING PROCEDURES.
   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city
in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (A)   The user fees for all users shall be prepared and billed monthly.
   (B)   The user fees may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the
properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such
billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which
are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the
collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills
have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall
be made at the office at which said records are kept and during the hours that
such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates
or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 17 days after the date of mailing of
the bill.

§ 53.024 CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED RETENTION BASIN.
   (A)   For any user that has a qualified retention facility on the property
being charged pursuant to this chapter, such user is entitled to a credit to be
determined by the Board. Procedures used to calculate the credit and the factor
for determining the impact of increased runoff volume shall be prescribed and
set by the Board.
   (B)   Calculation of discharge from developed sites and storm water
detention/retention basins, as well as storm water runoff volumes from
developed and undeveloped sites shall use methodology which is in accordance
with acceptable engineering practice. Peak discharge, hydrograph, flood
routing, and runoff volume procedures used by the Soil Conservation Service,
the Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of Reclamation, among others, are
considered acceptable.
   (C)   Any credit given to a user shall reduce the amount of base units
attributable to such user, but no credit may reduce the initial base units by
more than 50%. Before such credit is granted, the user must establish that its
facility meets the definition of a qualified retention facility. In addition,
such credits shall be subject to an annual review by the Board to determine
continuing compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND CONNECTIONS
§ 53.040 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-storm
water discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable
as required by federal and state law. This subchapter establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives
are:
   (A)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user.
   (B)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system.
   (C)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 53.041 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system
generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by
the Board.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 53.042 AUTHORIZED AGENT.
   The Board shall be the authorized agent for the city to insure that the
provisions of this chapter are carried out.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 53.043 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this subchapter
are minimum standards; therefore this subchapter does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will insure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 53.044 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system any materials, including
but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge
to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated), fire fighting activities, and any other
water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management as being necessary to protect public health and
safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the Board or its authorized agent prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections. No person shall construct, use,
maintain or continue the existence of illicit connections to the storm drain
system. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this subchapter if the
person connects a line conveying wastewater to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
(Ord. 18-2005, passed 6-21-2005; Am. Ord. 43-2005, passed 1-3-2006)

§ 53.046 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The Board or its authorized agent shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Board or its authorized
agent.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Board or its authorized agent
the ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Board or its authorized agent shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Board or its authorized agent to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The Board or its authorized agent has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Board or its authorized agent
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the access to a permitted facility
are a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility
with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the Board or its authorized
agent reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Board or its authorized agent has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the Board or its authorized agent
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
through the use of BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section.

of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Board or its authorized agent in person
or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the Board or its authorized agent in three business days of the phone notice.

industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.

right-of-way, whether in a paved area or not, must obtain a right-of-way cut
permit before any construction work is started. Subject, however, to the
provisions permitting emergency cuts contained in division (M)(3)(b) under
permits.
         (b)   All special provisions which are attached by the City Engineer
must be adhered to before any restoration will be accepted.
      (4)   Utility.
         (a)   All utility pole placements, or other above ground utility
facility placements, shall be regulated by the city. Utilities must obtain a
right-of- way cut permit before any construction work is started.
         (b)   The utility shall be responsible for the design of the utility
facility to be installed within the right-of-way. The city will be responsible
only for the review and approval of the utility's proposal with respect to the
location of the utility facilities to be installed on new construction and the
manner of installation as related to the city's standards and specifications.
Approval of the permit does not relieve the utility of responsibility for the
design. The city does not alter current regulations or authority for installing
utilities nor for determining financial responsibility for replacing or
adjusting utilities. The city limits itself to matters which preserve the safe
operation, maintenance and integrity of the city rights- of-way.
      (5)   Back yard utility or drainage easements.
         (a)   As specified in the municipal ordinance, "No person shall
excavate or dig in any of the streets, highways, alleys, or public grounds of
the city without first obtaining a permit from the city".
         (b)   By ordinance, back yard utility or drainage easements fall under
the jurisdiction of the city and will require a right-of-way cut permit before
any construction work is started. The utility shall be responsible for the
design of the utility facility to be installed on new construction within the
right-of-way. The city will be responsible only for the review and approval of
the utility's proposal with respect to the locations of the utility facilities
to be installed and the manner of installation as related to the city's
standards and specifications. Approval of the permit does not relieve the
utility of responsibility for the design. The city does not alter current
regulations or authority for installing utilities nor for determining financial
responsibility for replacing or adjusting utilities. The city limits itself to
matters which preserve the safe operation, maintenance and integrity of the
city right- of-way.
      (6)   Exceptions.
         (a)   Right-of-way cut permits are required for excavation on public
right-of-way within the corporate city limits only on properties dedicated to,
and accepted by the city. Subdivisions under construction whose rights-of-way,
easements or other public grounds have not yet been accepted are required to
meet the subdivision regulations as spelled out in the subdivision zoning
ordinance with approval by designated authorities, but are not required to
apply for a right-of-way cut permit. Upon construction completion, and
acceptance of said public grounds, any excavations thereafter will require a
right-of-way cut permit as indicated above.
         (b)   Right-of-way or public grounds dedicated to public agencies
other than the city, or to private agencies or individuals, do not fall under
city jurisdiction regarding right-of-way cut permits, e.g. state highway right-
of-way or other public grounds such as: State Road 18, 9, 37 & 15 right-of-way,
U.S. Post Office property, and the like. Any excavation within said public or
private grounds must be granted authorization by appropriate parties. It is the
responsibility of the contractor/utility to obtain permits or authorizations.

         (p)   Copy. A copy of the permit must be on site during working hours
as soon as possible after it is obtained.
      (4)   Fee schedule.
         (a)   Fees for right-of-way cut permits.
            1.   Fees for right-of-way cut permits shall be administered by the
City Engineer, or an appointed representative, using the following guidelines:
               a.   Right-of-way cuts, street cuts, or alternatives to street
cuts Permit Fee: $25.
               b.   Permit fee may be waived at the discretion of the City
Engineer.
            2.   Please note that pavement cuts shall be restricted on streets
that have been resurfaced within four years of the date of permit application.
Where alternative methods are not possible, such as in cases of emergency
repairs or taps on existing facilities located under pavement, fee charges may
be adjusted as follows:
   Pavement 0 to 12 months old      $400/each cut
   Pavement 12 to 24 months old   $300/each cut
   Pavement 24 to 36 months old   $200/each cut
   Pavement 36 to 48 months      $100/each cut
            3.   If the applicant demonstrates that it has exercised timely due
care in the placement, testing, maintenance and/or repair of the underground
facility for which access is required, the permit fee shall be $10. In the
event of a dispute between the applicant and the City Engineer as to the amount
of the permit fee, the matter shall be referred to the Board of Public Works
and Safety for resolution. The permit shall, however, be issued at the time of
application subject to fee modification as set out in division (N)(4)(a)2.
            4.   Combined permits (bar hole testing, running new lines, and the
like). The projects or series of cuts may be combined into one permit and only
one permit fee charge as determined by the City Engineer.
         (b)   Sidewalks.  In the case of a permit issued for the purpose of
installing or replacing a sidewalk within the right-of-way, and inspection for
correctness of forms and grade will be required before any concrete can be
poured. A permit for sidewalk installation will thus be $10.
         (c)   Residential driveway approach. In the case of a permit issued
for the purpose of installing or replacing a residential driveway approach
within the right-of-way, an inspection for correctness of forms and grade will
be required before any concrete can be poured. A permit for a residential
driveway approach installation will thus be $10.
         (d)   Commercial driveway approach. In the case of a permit issued for
the purpose of installing or replacing a commercial driveway approach within
the right-of-way, an inspection for correctness of forms and grade will be
required before any concrete can be poured. A final inspection will also be
required. A permit for a commercial driveway approach installation will thus be
$10.
         (e)   Permit denial.  If a permit is denied, a refund shall be given
to the applicant. If applicant feels that denial is unjustified, he may appeal
that decision through the Board of Public Works and Safety.
      (5)   Traffic control procedures.
         (a)   The main reason for adequate traffic control is to provide
safety for the workers and motorists. Additionally, the city may be held liable
if motorists become involved in accidents due to poor traffic control at a
street cut repair.
         (b)   Basically, there are three important components of traffic
control:
            1.   To get the work done.
            2.   To keep traffic moving with a minimum of disruption.
            3.   To maintain safety. Safety is achieved by advance warning for
motorists, visibility, protection of the work area and clear directions to
traffic.
         (c)   Traffic controls for utility construction and maintenance
operations shall conform with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
Streets and Highways. All construction and maintenance operations should be
planned with full regard to safety and keeping traffic interference to an
absolute minimum.
         (d)   On arterial streets or streets within the Downtown Business
District, as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, construction or maintenance
operations interfering with traffic shall need to be coordinated with the City
Engineer in order to establish working hours.
      (6)   How to make a cut. All cuts shall be made in accordance with this
section. All edges or joint of existing pavement shall be thoroughly cleaned
and tack coated prior to the placement of hot asphalt surface using a
mechanical asphalt machine to provide level asphalt placement.
         (a)   Street repairs to leave the pavement in a condition at least as
good as, if not better than, the condition prior to the repairs. In most cases,
particularly in the case of extensive excavation repairs, it is desirable to
survey the existing pavement condition with a representative from the
Engineering Department prior to the work. After completion of the work, survey
the pavement condition again to verify that the pavement condition has been
maintained or improved. In the case of minor repairs, these pavement surveys
can be made by visual observation.
         (b)   Avoid weakening or destroying the existing pavement around an
excavation with heavy construction equipment, stock piling, or delivery of
materials, etc. When damage does occur, remove the damaged pavement extending
the limits of the street repair before replacing the pavement. No stockpiling
of backfill or road building materials is permitted on the pavement.
         (c)   Right-of-way street cut repair details. Some examples of methods
that are not acceptable and corresponding acceptable methods are provided in
the following examples:
            1.    Existing pavements should be removed to clean, straight lines
parallel and perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Do not construct patches
with angled sides and irregular shapes. All repairs should be full lane
width.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2801.gif]
   Do not construct patches with angled sides and irregular shapes.
            2.    Avoid patches within existing patches. If this cannot be
avoided, make boundaries of the patches coincide. All repairs should be full
lane width.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2803.gif]
   Avoid patches within existing patches.
            3.    Do not leave strips of pavement less than one-half lane in
width from the edge of the new patch to the edge of an existing patch or the
lip of the gutter.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2805.gif]
   Do not leave strips of pavement less than one-half lane in width.
            4.    In concrete pavements, remove sections to existing joints, or
new saw cut joints at mid- slab, that are in good repair. In damaged concrete,
limits of removal should be determined in the field by a representative of the
city Engineering Department.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2807.gif]
   In concrete pavements, remove sections to existing joints.
            5.    Asphalt and concrete pavements should be removed by saw
cutting or grinding. Avoid breaking away the edges of the existing pavement or
damaging the remaining pavement with heavy construction equipment.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2809.gif]
   All edges shall be saw cut.
            6.    In the case of a series of patches or patches for service
lines off a main trench, repair the pavement over the patches and overlay when
spacing between patches is less than ten feet. In cases where existing pavement
is in poor condition and may require overlay within the next few years, this
requirement may be modified or waived by the city Engineering Department.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2811.gif]
   The patched area must include any existing patches within ten feet.
            7.   Completed street repairs should have rideability at least as
good as, if not better than, the pavement prior to the repairs. A driver may be
able to see a street repair, but in the case of a quality repair, should not be
able to “feel” it in normal driving. A patch should provide a smooth ride with
smooth transitions on and off the repair and all joints should be located
outside the wheel path. Overlays should be placed by first removing the
existing pavement to the desired depth by grinding or milling, and then placing
the pavement flush with the adjacent surfaces. Overlays with feathered edges
are not acceptable.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2813.gif]
   Patches may not decrease rideability.
            8.    Surface tolerances for street repairs should meet the
standard for new construction. That is, the finished surface of the street
repair should be tested with a ten foot straightedge parallel to the centerline
or perpendicular across joints. Variations measured from the testing face of
the straightedge to the surface of the street repair should not exceed 1/
4 inch.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2815.gif]
   Surface tolerances for street repairs should meet the standard for new
construction.
            9.    Transverse patches on arterial and collector streets shall be
overlaid across the entire width for a distance of ten feet minimum on all
sides of the trench either by milling or excavation of existing materials.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2817.gif]
   Trenches must be patched minimum ten feet on all directions.
            10.   Do not allow the edges of patches to fall in existing wheel
paths. The edges of patches parallel to the direction of traffic shall be
limited to the boundaries of lanes or to the centerline of travel lanes.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2819.gif]
   Do not allow the edges of patches to fall in wheel paths.
             11.    Patches should have a smooth longitudinal grade consistent
with the existing roadway. Patches should also have a cross slope or cross-
section consistent with the design of the existing roadway.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2821.gif]
   Patch slope and grade must match existing pavement.
            12.   When the proposed excavation fails within ten feet of a
section of pavement damaged during the street cut repair, the failed area shall
be removed to sound pavement and patched. Scarring, gouging, or other damaged
pavement adjacent to a patch shall be removed and the pavement repaired to the
satisfaction of the city Engineering Department.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2823.gif]
   Damaged pavement within ten feet of a patch must also be patched.
            13.   For patches in asphalt, a tack coat shall be applied to all
edges of the existing asphalt before placing the new pavement. After placing
the new asphalt, all seams (joints) between the new and existing pavements
shall be sealed with an asphalt tack coat or rubberized crack seal material.
Avoid frequent changes in width of patches. For future maintenance, this
simplifies removal of adjacent pavement failures.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d16af51eb8c737b6e613632d06df38192613a2d5/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2825.gif]
   Patches must avoid frequent width changes.
             14.   Pavement markings. During the repair if any pavement
markings are damaged or removed i.e.: Stop Bars, Turn Arrows, Lettering or
Center Line markings the contractor will be responsible for repair and, or
replacing these pavement markings under the direction of the city Engineering
Department.
         (d)   Grassed and lawn areas. In established lawn areas, all repairs
shall be restored within 12 inches of the surface then topped off with a
minimum of 12 inches of top soil restoring all contours. The area shall then be
fertilized, seeded, and mulched. If the slope is greater than 3.1 or if the
area has been previously sodded, restoration of grass shall be made by sodding
or with straw mats. At 30 days after completion and restoration of a cut in a
portion of an established lawn within the public right-of-way, the permit
holder shall inspect the cut and if it has settled below the adjacent surface,
the permit holder shall fill and compact the settled area and re-seed or re-
sod. The permit holder shall inspect the cut again 30 days following the second
restoration, and if the cut has again settled below the surface, shall fill and
compact the settled area and re-seed. Such inspections shall continue every 30
days until an inspection discloses the cut has not settled more than two inches
below the adjacent surface in any 30 day period. The permit holder’s bond will
not be released until the seeded area shows 75% re- growth and meets the
settling requirement above.
      (7)   Standards and specifications for construction. By this section,
under excavation repair, the city established standards and specifications to
be followed by utilities/contractors when making installations or repairs
within the city right-of-way. These standards, along with any modifications or
revisions subsequently approved by the city, are in effect and will be enforced
as follows:
         (a)   Excavation repair. Whereas, the Board of Public Works and Safety
deems it necessary to establish a firm policy for the backfilling of excavation
and replacement of pavement disturbed as a result of making an opening or
excavation in any street, these specifications are set forth and the compliance
therewith shall be a requirement of obtaining a permit for said opening or
excavation as set forth in the Marion Municipal Code. It shall be the
obligation of any person, firm or corporation obtaining a permit for an opening
or excavation in the public right-of-way to backfill the excavation and replace
the pavement as set forth in these specifications.
            1.   Bedding. Sewer, water, gas lines shall be bedded with
compacted granular material to a maximum height of 12 inches above the top of
the line. All bedding shall be thoroughly compacted by mechanical tamping. The
use of a backhoe bucket or wheel rolling will not be allowed.
            2.   Backfilling.
                 a.   If protection of under- ground facilities does require
the used of clay backfill, then the entire depth of the excavation shall be
filled with granular material, backfill shall be pit run, or pit run and course
sand and stone placed in 12-inch layers with each layer being thoroughly
compacted by means of mechanical or pneumatic tamping.
               b.   Frozen material shall not be used as backfill.
               c.   The last 12 inches to grade shall be #53 crushed stone and
shall be tamped in place. Number 53 crushed stone shall be rounded one or two
inches higher than grade in the center of the trench, and shall be maintained
by the contractor until the surface finish is applied.
               d.   Cold mix asphaltic concrete may be used a temporary measure
if the temperature so requires and if hot mix is not available. When hot
asphaltic concrete becomes available, the temporary cold mix shall be removed
from patch and replaced with hot mix. Hot mix shall be rolled or compacted in
place insure proper density and wearing characteristics.
               e. Replacing the pavement and base. Concrete shall:
                  i.   Be high early strength type.
                  ii.   Have compressive strength of 4,000 PSE after 28 days.
                  iii.   Have 4 to 6% entrained air.
                  iv.   Be placed with uniform depth.
               f.   When repairing concrete surfaces:
                  i.   Concrete shall be broom finished to conform to the cross
section and profile of the roadway, and the edges trowled to be neat and
uniform.
                  ii.   If an opening is to extend from one joined section of
existing pavement into another, a butt joint or contraction joint of two inches
in depth shall be constructed on the alignment of the original joint.
                  iii.   If opening is to be more than 20 feet in length and no
original joints are provided, then contraction joints shall be constructed so
that no joint spacing is greater than 20 feet.
               g.   Curing concrete.
                  i.   As soon as newly placed concrete acquires its initial
set, but no more than 12 hours after placing, an approved method of curing
shall be initiated which will not discolor or disfigure the pavement.
                  ii.   Concrete shall be closed to traffic for 48 hours when
the temperature is above 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and 72 hours when the
temperature is at least 35 degrees Fahrenheit.
                  iii.   No person shall place concrete without the prior
consent of the City Engineer if the temperature is less than 35 degrees
Fahrenheit.
               h.   Hot asphaltic concrete pavement.
                  i.   Materials and application shall meet the specifications
for hot asphaltic concrete as prescribed for maintenance materials for the
ISHSS.

               o.   The producer may use water as reducing admixtures and also
air-entraining admixtures when used in accordance with the admixture's
manufacture's recommendations. The flowable fill may have air content form 0
through 25% by volume
               p.   Before any flowable fill is placed, any pipes, structure,
or other objects that might be displaced by the placement of the flowable fill
shall be adequately anchored, braced, or otherwise secured.
               q.   The mixture shall be delivered and discharged using ready-
mix trucks approved for use by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
               r.   A copy of the batch ticket for the delivered flowable fill
shall be required to be turned into the City Engineering Department upon
completion of repairs to the street cut.
               s.   Flowable fill shall not be placed on frozen ground.
               t.   Flowable fill shall be protected from freezing until
material has stiffened and bleeding water subsided. When the temperature of the
air at placement is below freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit), the City Engineer
may require that freezing protection extend for as long as 48 hours.
               u.   Flowable fill placement for non-residential streets are as
follows:
                  i.   When used with concrete: Place the flowable fill to
minimum of six inches below finished surface of the adjacent pavement prior to
placing six inches of class A concrete. The concrete may be placed as soon as
bleeding has subsided. The concrete shall be protected from traffic for a
minimum of 48 hours, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer of his
designated representative.
                  ii.   When used with hot asphalt: Place the flowable fill to
a minimum of six inches below finished surface of the adjacent pavement prior
to placing a four and one-half inches of HMA #5 Base and one and one-half
inches of HMA #11 Surface meeting current INDOT Specifications for 402 asphalt
paving.
               v.   Flowable fill placement for residential streets are as
follows:
                  i.   When used with concrete: Place the flowable fill to
minimum of four and one-half inches below finished surface of the adjacent
pavement prior to placing four and one-half inches of class A concrete. The
concrete may be placed as soon as bleeding has subsided. The concrete shall be
protected from traffic for a minimum of 48 hours, unless otherwise approved by
the City Engineer of his designated representative.
                  ii.   When used with hot asphalt: Place the flowable fill to
a minimum of four and one-half inches below finished surface of the adjacent
pavement prior to placing a three inches of HMA #5 Base and one and one-half
inches of HMA #11 Surface meeting current INDOT Specifications for 402 asphalt
paving.
               w.   Flowable fill placement in unpaved streets or alleys are as
follows: When used with concrete. Place the flowable fill to minimum of six
inches below the adjacent grade. After the flowable fill has cured for 24
hours, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer of his designated
representative, six inches of compacted #73 crushed stone placed in three-inch
lifts meeting current INDOT specifications, shall be placed and compacted.
               x.   Flowable fill placement if unable to place concrete or
asphalt within the specified time are as follows:
                  i.   The flowable fill may be placed to match the finished
surface of the adjacent pavement and exposed to traffic after water bleeding
has subsided or one hour has passed, whichever is longer, for a maximum of 24
hours. Within 24 hours of opening to traffic, the excess material must be
removed and repairs be made pursuit to the aforementioned divisions.
                  ii.   Any request for waiver of the flowable fill requirement
shall be made in writing to the City Engineer. It shall be at the sole
discretion of the City Engineer whether to approve or disapprove of any such
request. If such wavier is granted, granular backfill, meeting current INDOT
Specifications for B Borrow, # 53, #73 compacted aggregate, may be used when
placed in six-inch lifts and compacted to 95% of the maximum dry density, as
determined by accepted AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials) standards and procedures, and confirmed by test
results from INDOT certified laboratory.
            3.   Castings and manholes. Castings, manholes, and the like
adjusted to grade shall be backfilled with concrete to within two inches of the
final surface. The final inches shall be brought to grade with hot asphaltic
concrete and compacted using hand tamps, mechanical tamper, or roller.
            4.   Maintenance of traffic. If a cut in the pavement cannot be
completed during normal working hours, the cut shall be protected by either
temporarily backfilling, steel plated, or barricaded.
               a.   Temporary backfill. When cut is temporarily backfilled. The
top four inches shall consist of a cold mixed bituminous coated aggregate.
               b.   Steel plate. When a cut is steel plated, the plate shall be
of sufficient size and thickness to carry the traffic. The steel plate shall be
properly fastened down so as not to create a hazard.
               c.   Barricade. When barricades are used, a minimum of four
lighted standard Type II traffic barricades shall be placed and fenced with
colored fencing material.
               d.   Due to high traffic volumes on certain streets within th
city, cuts made on the streets listed in division (O) shall be steel plated or
temporarily backfilled. The use of barricades on these streets shall not be
allowed, except as directed by the Engineer.
            5.   Permanent surface restoration (to include asphalt or
concrete).
               a.   i.    All faces of exposed curbing shall be tacked below
the finished pavement elevation. The restoration of the surface of all cuts
shall be completed by such methods and in such manner that the plane of the
surface of the repair, at time of completion and thereafter, will be all
contiguous surfaces and will create no dissymmetry with the topography of the
roadway. Also, the final surface elevation shall be at the same elevation as
the original surface. The surface restoration may be made by using milling, or
future technologies approved by the city Engineering Department, unless a
specific method is required by the permit or by the Inspector. As a part of the
permanent surface restoration the permit holder may be required to share in the
cost of adding roadway improvements which include but are not limited to
resurfacing, adding curbs, curb cuts, sidewalk or items necessary to meet
requirements of the American’s with Disabilities Act or the city Engineering
Department design standards.
                  ii.    Patch configuration requirements. The following cases
shall require resurfacing as indicated in §
98.39(N)(6):
                     (i)    When a diagonal cut is made, the area shall be
"squared" off. Any lane impacted within the squared off area shall be
completely resurfaced.
                     (ii)    When an excavation is cut on any streets, any lane
impacted shall be completely restored for the entire length of the excavation.
                     (iii)    In addition to the above, if the cut on a street
overlaps the centerline of an existing road, the street shall be restored from
curb line to curb line or from lane to lane so that the area affected has been
properly restored.
                     (iv)    Any street lane markings, i.e.: long line, skip
line, arrows, that are damaged during street cut repair will be replaced with
like material. Faded marking replacement will be approved by the Engineering
Department.
                     (v)    Further clarification on approved practices for
street cut repair can be found in permanent surface restoration details.
               b.   Brick streets. Brick streets shall be restored to their
original surface condition and pattern. At the discretion of the Engineering
Department, brick alleys shall be restored to their original surface condition
and pattern. Special attention needs to be given to the Historical Areas. All
streets within the Historical Areas must be restored to their original
condition.
               c.   Brick sidewalks. Brick sidewalks shall be restored to their
surface condition and pattern. All other areas will be at the discretion of the
Department.
               d.   Driveways.
                  i.    Prior to any removal of driveways, residential or
commercial, a 24-hour notice to the owner of the affected property will be
required either by personal notification or door hanger. If removal is started
without this notification, the Engineering Department will have the right to
stop the activity until the properly owner is satisfied that they have time to
make arrangements for ingress and egress.
                  ii.    Brick driveways shall be restored to their original
surface and pattern.
                  iii.    Concrete pavement shall be repaired with concrete to
original specifications. The existing driveway thickness shall be matched, but
the minimum thickness shall be six inches for residential drives. The concrete
shall be finished flush with the existing pavement and textured to a rough
broom finish. The perimeter of the cut shall be crack sealed. Class A concrete
shall be used throughout. The new concrete shall be protected against excessive
dehydration by the application of a membrane type curing compound (white
pigment). The new concrete shall be protected from all traffic for 48 hours. If
this is done by the use of plates, the plates shall be steel with a minimum 3/
4 inch thickness. These plates shall be secured so as not to move and
constitute a hazard when they are open to traffic.
               e.    Asphalt pavement and driveways: shall be repaired with
asphalt. The existing driveway thickness shall be matched, but the minimum
driveway thickness for residential drives shall be six inches of compacted
aggregate two inches of binder on and inch of surface on compacted subgrade.
All edges or joints of existing pavement shall be thoroughly cleaned and
tacked.
               f.    Gravel or stone alleys shall be restored to original
condition.
            6.   Inspection and testing. A city Engineering Department
Inspector may require inspection of subgrade repair prior to flowable fill
being placed. If granular backfill is used, the Inspector may be present during
backfill operation. The permit holder may be required to provide to the city
Engineering Department test results as requested. The Inspector additionally
may perform random testing. Activation of permits serves as notification for
inspections. The Inspector may require documentation (delivery tickets and
required test certifications) verifying proper materials and installation
procedures.
            7.   Substantial deviations from these regulations shall not be
made without written approval from the city Engineering Department. The
Engineering Department may grant variances and/or waivers of any portion of
these regulations.
            8.   Appeal. Any person affected by these regulations and who
objects to a decision made or action taken, may appeal in writing within ten
working days the decision or action to the City Council for administrative
review.
      (8)   Permit time limit, maintenance of traffic.
         (a)   Permit time limit.
            1.   Upon approval of the permit, applicant shall have 30 days in
which to complete final repairs. In the event that construction may require
additional time for completion, an extension may be granted to applicant at no
additional cost provided said extension is applied for prior to expiration of
permit time.
            2.   During those months of late fall months of winter when hot
bituminous asphalt mix is not available the cut shall be temporarily repaired.
All temporary winter repairs shall be final repaired by June 1 of any given
year.
            3.   Where a right-of-way cut permit is issued in conjunction with
a building permit, the permit time limit shall be extended to coincide with the
time limitations enforced by the building permit.
         (b)   Excavation time limit. All cuts in the pavement area shall be
open to traffic at all times except when the contractor is working at the site.
If the cut in the pavement cannot be completed in the working day, it shall be
adequately barricaded with a minimum of four lighted approved barricades and
fenced with colored fencing material. State highways and truck routes within
the city shall be steel plated and properly fastened so as not to create a
hazard.
      (9)   Long term responsibility for the cut.
         (a)   By authority of the municipal ordinance, and by the terms of the
granting of the right-of-way cut permit, the applicant agrees to maintain the
work in connection with the permit for a period of two years from the date of
acceptance of the completed work.
         (b)   In the event of a failure of the workmanship or materials, the
contractor/utility will be notified in writing, and given a specified period of
time in which to make repairs. If repairs have not been made within the
allotted time, the city will make the repairs, or contract for the repairs,
with the cost of said repairs being charged to the applicant. If payment is not
received within 60 days after repairs are complete, the repair costs shall be
charged against the bond.
      (10)   Penalties for non-compliance. Any contractor/utility doing work
without a permit is subject to citation for violation of a city ordinance which
could result in fines as spelled out as follows: Unless otherwise provided in
this code, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of this code
shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $5,000.
      (11)   Alternatives to pavement cuts. 
         (a)   Untrenched construction. Permits may be issued for cuts to be
made into unpaved areas, however, pavement cuts will be discouraged on any
streets and any streets surfaced or resurfaced within a four-year period prior
to the date of application. Presently, three methods of untrenched construction
are used in the state to replace damaged pipes and avoid pavement cuts.
Replacements can be made by jacking, coring, or boring.
         (b)   Pits. The pits for the untrenched construction shall be located
a minimum of ten feet from the edge of the street. Pits should be excavated no
more than 48 hours in advance of untrenched construction and backfilled within
48 hours after construction is completed. While the pits are open, they shall
be marked and protected by barricades. Shoring is required for any excavation
over five feet. The shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and
maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads during
construction.
         (c)   Jacking. Jacking is one of the most popular untrenched methods
for pipes less than six inches in diameter. A casing or corrosion-resistant
carrier must be used. Driving works most effectively in compressible soils. A
study thrust, hammering or vibrating is needed to drive the pipe with a pilot
shoe. Driving should not be used for long distances. Long drives may wander far
from the desired line and grade.
         (d)   Boring. Boring is another popular alternative to street cuts.
Large pipes can be jacked through oversize bores and carved progressively ahead
of the pipe. The auger should not exceed the outside diameter of the following
pipe by more than one inch. The spoil is mucked back through the pipe. Line and
grade are easy to control. A grout backfill is used for pipes more than 12
inches in diameter and for overbreaks, unused holes, or abandoned pipes.
         (e)   Coring. Coring is the third alternative to street cuts. This
method is mainly used when driving becomes too difficult in had soils. Line and
grade are fairly easy to control with coring. A small casing (six inches or
less) without a pilot shoe is drilled into the difficult soil. The soil enters
the pipe as it advances. Then the core is removed by a sluicing, during or
after the drilling.
      (12)   Overhead power and communication lines.
         (a)   Factors. A safe traffic environment, the appearance of the
roadway, and the efficiency and economy of roadway maintenance are critical
factors which require the city to regulate above ground utility locations.
Ground-mounted utility facilities should be placed as far as practical from the
traveled way and beyond the clear zone. (A clear zone is that roadside border
area, starting at the edge of the traveled way, available for use by errant
vehicles.)
         (b)   Type of Construction. Any longitudinal installations of overhead
lines within the city right-of-way should be limited to single pole type
construction. Joint-use single pole construction is encouraged, as allowed by
the National Electrical Code, at locations where more than one utility or type
of facility is involved.
         (c)   Vertical clearance.  The minimum vertical clearance for overhead
power and communication lines above the roadway and the lateral and vertical
clearance from bridges should conform with the current National Electrical
Code. Greater clearances should be used where required by state law, regulation
or policy.
         (d)   Location. Ground-mounted facilities shall be located at or as
near as practical to the right-of-way line as possible. Where there are curbed
sections the utilities should be located as far as practical behind the face of
outer curbs but not less than 24 inches and, where feasible, behind the
sidewalks. Guy wires to ground anchors and stub poles should not be placed
between a pole and the traveled way where they encroach upon the clear zone.
      (13)   Locating existing utilities. It shall be the responsibility of the
contractor/utility to determine the location of any underground utilities in
the area of the excavation prior to commencing work.
         (a)   To assist in utility location, following is a list of telephone
numbers to call, and the utility they apply to:
            1.   Call 1-800-382-5544 from within Indiana, or 1-800-428-5200
from outside Indiana two days before you dig to locate electric, gas and
telephone lines ("Holey-Moley").
            2.   Call (317) 662-1243 for water line locations.
            3.   Call (317) 662-1243 for sewer line locations.
            4.   Call (317) 662-0071 for Marion Cablevision line locations.
            5.   Call (317) 668-4375 or (317) 668-4383 for Indiana Gas Co.
dispatcher.
         (b)   Approval of a right-of-way cut permit in no way relieves the
Utility or Contractor or any duty or responsibility for any damage, loss or
liability regarding the location of utilities.
         (c)   Marking of utilities. The city requires all public agencies,
utilities, contractors, other associations, manufacturers and all other groups
involved in underground excavation to adopt the Utility Location and
Coordination Council (ULCC) Uniform Color Code for temporary making of
underground facilities as follows:
            1.   Red. Electric power lines, cables, conduit and lighting
cables.
            2.   Yellow. Gas, oil, steam, petroleum or gaseous materials.
            3.   Orange. Communication, alarm or signal lines, cables or
conduit.
            4.   Blue. Water, irrigation and slurry lines.
            5.   Green. Sewers and drain lines.
      (14)   A copy of the permit must be on site during working hours.
   (O)   The use of barricades shall not be used on the following streets
within the city, except as directed by the City Engineer.
Adam Street         From S.R. 15 (38th St.) to 2nd Street

determine that the alarm reference is a nuisance alarm, then they shall deliver
to the building owner and occupant a notice that the system is to be inspected
and/or repaired by a licensed fire alarm contractor or electrician within 15
days. Once the owner certifies to the Department that the repair has been made
in a timely fashion, they are deemed to have complied and any further response
to the property will be addressed as if it where a first response. If the
repair is not undertaken, all subsequent responses to that location shall
considered false alarms until such time as the repair is made and a
certification of the repair is presented to and approved by Fire Department
personnel.
      (2)   False fire alarm. In the event of a second activation of a fire
alarm system deemed to be a false alarm, the owner shall be served with a
letter for excessive false fire alarms attached with a fire alarm activation
report by the Department, indicating that it has responded to the business two
times and both deemed to be a false call, and if it responds to a deemed false
alarm for a third time within one calendar year, the Fire Department shall
direct that the alarm user submit a report of service/repair within 15 calendar
days of receiving the letter, and provide a completed certificate of inspection
of testing and maintenance. A fine for the third false alarm shall be paid by
the owner within 15 days of the posted date served.
      (3)   Schedule of penalties. The fine schedule as follows:
         (a)   Third false alarm: $300;
         (b)   Fourth false alarm: $400;
         (c)   Fifth false alarm: $500;
         (d)   After the fifth false alarm $600 thereafter in the same calendar
year;
         (e)   If firefighters respond to a fire alarm and they find that the
alarm company is working on the system without prior notification to the Fire
Department, as required by the State Fire Marshal's Office, the alarm company
working on the system will be fined $500;
         (f)   For false alarms resulting from intentionally pulling a fire
alarm without an emergency, the person who pulled the fire alarm and/or the
parents responsible for a juvenile who pulled the fire alarm will be fined
$1,500. A child must be at least 12 years old to be considered a juvenile.
         (g)   Tampering with a life safety system will result in a fine of
$2,500 and the filing of a report for possible criminal charges.
   (C)   Examples of alarms that do not qualify as a penalty of this section:
      (1)   An activation of the alarm caused by a fire or smoke;
      (2)   A qualified person testing the alarm system who has notified the
Fire Department prior to the test;
      (3)   An alarm caused by someone who is not an employee smoking near a
detector, unless the building has posted signs stating that no smoking is
permitted on the grounds of the building.
   (D)   Guidelines.
      (1)   A fire alarm contractor, alarm user, or any individual shall not
conduct testing or perform repair work on any fire alarm system, sprinkler
system or fire suppression system without first notifying the Fire Department
dispatch center that such testing or repair work is being performed. Violation
of this provision shall result in the imposition of a fine.
      (2)   During the 15-day period after the receipt of a letter for
excessive false fire alarms, the owner shall have 15 days to correct the
problem, which will not be counted toward the year’s total false fire alarms,
provided the problem is corrected.
      (3)   Newly installed fire alarms.
         (a)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any newly
installed fire alarm system for a period of 45 days from the date of
installation.
         (b)   In an existing building, the 45 days begin when the installation
of the new system is completed. In new construction, the 45 days begin when the
installation of the system is completed and an occupancy permit is issued.
         (c)   Should any service fine assessed pursuant to this section remain
unpaid in excess of 30 days, a late fee shall be assessed and shall be payable
in addition to the original fine. The late fee shall be $25.
   (E)   All fines collected from all penalties will be deposited into Account
339-91 labeled as Education and Instruction.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.65 APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION RECEIPT.
   (A)   No owner of real estate within the city shall permit it to be leased
for any purpose that includes any person using the premises as their living
quarters, until a registration receipt covering each rental unit in the
building has been obtained. If any property is being sold on contract and/or
quitclaim deed, the owner shall provide a copy of the recorded contract and/or
quitclaim deed to the Building Department to avoid responsibility for
registration.
   (B)   A registration receipt shall be obtained by applying for the receipt
at the City Building Department, and by paying an annual registration fee for a
parcel of real estate upon which a rental unit(s) is located, or an annual
registration fee for each hotel or rooming house. The initial registration fee
shall be submitted at the time the application is made.
      (1)   At the time application is made, the owner of the real estate shall
supply the Building Department with the name and physical address of the owner,
the street address of the property being registered, the nature and use of the
rental building, its number of units, and the name and physical address of any
property manager.
      (2)   The owner of a property whose physical address is not within the
state must appoint an agent or property manager residing within 30 miles of the
property. The failure to appoint an agent or property manager is a separate
violation. An agent or property manager must be at least 21 years of age. The
agent or property manager must be available to government officials by
telephone 24 hours a day. The owner’s failure to make certain that the agent or
property manager is available and maintains the property will result in a $500
civil penalty for each parcel in violation. Post office box numbers are not
acceptable.
      (3)   For any dwelling in which the owner does not reside, the name,
address and telephone number of the owner, or his or her agent or responsible
person, if any, shall be:
         (a)   Supplied in writing to the occupants of the dwelling; and
         (b)   Posted in a public or prominent place on the premises, visible
from outside the structure, or in the alternative, provided to the City
Building Department. The information shall be legible, accurate, and kept up-
to-date. Post office box numbers are not acceptable.
   (C)   An inspection officer may conduct an inspection of each rental unit if
the Building Department has reason to believe, or receives a complaint, that
the rental unit does not comply with all requirements of this section, any
other applicable ordinance, and all applicable state laws.
      (1)   The inspection will not be made if the rental unit meets the
exception provided in I.C. 36-1-20-4.1(c).
      (2)   The owner or the owner’s representative shall be entitled to 72
hours written notice from the inspection officer prior to conducting the
inspection.
      (3)   In the event that the owner, or the tenant if occupied, refuses to
allow the inspection officer to conduct the inspection, the inspection officer
or appointed agent shall apply for a warrant to make the inspection pursuant to
the following terms.
         (a)   If the owners or those in possession of a building refuse
inspection, an inspection officer of the Building Department may obtain an
inspection warrant from any court of record in the county in which the building
is located, in order to determine if the building is an unsafe building. The
court shall issue the warrant subject to the following conditions.
            1.   The person seeking the warrant must establish that the
building to be searched or inspected as part of a legally authorized program of
inspection that naturally includes the building, or that there is cause for
believing that a condition, object, activity or circumstance legally justifies
a search or inspection of that building.
            2.   An affidavit establishing one of the grounds described in
division (C)(3)(b) must be signed under oath or affirmation by the affiant.
            3.   The court must examine the affiant under oath or affirmation
to verify the accuracy of the affidavit.
         (b)   The warrant is valid only if it:
            1.   Is signed by the judge of the court and bears the date and
hour of its issuance above that signature, with a notation that the warrant is
valid for only 48 hours after its issuance;
            2.   Describes (either directly or by reference to the affidavit)
the building where the search or inspection is to occur so that the executor of
the warrant and owner or the possessor of the building can reasonably determine
what property is authorized for inspection by the warrant;
            3.   Indicates the conditions, objects, activities or circumstances
that the inspection is intended to check or reveal; and
            4.   Is attached to the affidavit required to be made in order to
obtain the warrant.
         (c)   A warrant issued under this section is valid for only 48 hours
after its issuance, must be personally served upon the owner or possessor of
the building, and must be returned within 72 hours.
   (D)    After payment of the required fee, the Building Department shall
issue to the owner of every registered rental unit a registration receipt and
an inspection certificate, when applicable.
   (E)   If a rental unit that has been vacant for at least 12 months is
inspected and does not meet all of the requirements of this section, the
Building Department may issue a rental registration receipt, if the violations
do not make the unit unsafe, and a cash bond is posted with the Building
Department in the amount of $500, or the reasonably estimated cost of the
required repairs if greater than $500.
      (1)   The cash bond will be forfeited to the city if the repairs are not
made within 180 days of posting the cash bond. The forfeiture of the cash bond
does not relieve the owner from the obligation to make the required repairs,
nor does the forfeiture create any obligation on the city to make the required
repairs.
      (2)   If the repairs are made within 180 days, the Building Department
will return the cash bond to the party posting the bond, and will issue an
inspection certificate.
   (F)   Each registration receipt shall be valid for a period of one year and
must be renewed annually. Each registration receipt shall be renewed by its
expiration date by submitting the registration fee to the Building Department.
In the event that the registration fee is not paid within 30 days after its
expiration date, a late fee will be assessed, and the renewal will be backdated
to its prior expiration date. Any registration receipt issued shall be valid
for the annual period, commencing on the anniversary date of the original
expiration date, and not as of the date of payment. Payment of the registration
fee shall not be considered a defense to any action filed by the city to
enforce the provisions of this section, if such action was filed prior to
payment of the registration fee.
   (G)   The registration receipt applies to the rental unit and not to the
owner of the property. However, within 30 days of the sale of the equitable or
legal title to any property registered under this section, any person acquiring
equitable or legal title shall notify the Building Department of their name and
address. No new registration fee shall be due until the expiration date of the
current registration receipt.
   (H)   Each owner of a rental unit warrants at each change of tenant that the
rental unit meets the registration set forth in this section. This warrant is
implied in the very act of renting the unit, and liability for it may not be
removed by any act or agreement, either written or verbal, of either the owner
or the prospective tenant.

survey, at all reasonable times, all rental units subject to §
150.65(C) and the inspection warrant provisions of I.C. 36-7-9-16. The owner,
or the owner’s representative, and/or occupant of every rental unit shall give
the inspection officer free access to such rental unit and its premises at all

inspection officer.
      (3)   Upon completion of the initial inspection, the city shall leave the
occupant a written notice that the inspection was conducted.
      (4)   This provision shall not be construed to limit or restrain the
right of the inspection officer to inspect any other building or premises.

owner’s representative, access to any part of the dwelling or rental unit or
its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of making such repairs or
alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this
section.
   (C)   The Building Department shall issue to the owner of every registered
and inspected rental unit, if applicable, an inspection certificate as proof
that the unit passed inspection.
   (D)   At each change of tenancy, every owner or the owner’s representative
shall provide the occupant with a copy of the inspection certificate, if
applicable. The copy shall become part of the warranty of habitability of the
premises provided for in §
150.65(H). In the case of hotel or rooming house, the inspection certificate
shall be posted in a conspicuous place within the facility.
   (E)   If an inspection officer finds that a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming
house, rooming unit, or any other building or structure fails to comply with
any standard set forth in this section, any other city ordinance, or any state
statute, he or she shall give notice of the alleged violation to the owner of
the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, rooming unit, or any other building
or structure. The notice shall be in writing and shall reasonably describe the
violation found. The notice shall further specify the date by which the
violation must be corrected. The notice shall be served upon the owner or the
owner’s representative, and the occupant of the dwelling, dwelling unit,
rooming house, rooming unit, or any other building or structure.
   (F)   A building that the inspection officer finds to be unsafe shall be
repaired so that it meets acceptable standards within 15 days of the notice
described in division (E). Any other violations shall be repaired within 30
days of the notice of a violation described in division (E). If the violations
cited are not corrected, a reinspection fee shall be levied against the person
(either owner or occupant) responsible for correcting the violation cited.
Reinspection may continue until the violations are corrected. The reinspection
fee may be waived if the inspection officer finds that substantial progress has
been made with regards to each separate violation noted, or that the failure to
correct the violation is not within the control of the person responsible for
correcting the violation cited.
   (G)   If a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, rooming unit, or any
other building or structure is cited for violations of this section, no new
violations shall be cited at the time of the reinspection for the original
violation, unless such new violations make the property unsafe.
   (H)   Nothing in the preceding division should be construed to require an
investigation by the Building Department or any city employee prior to the city
filing a complaint against the owner of real estate who fails to obtain a
required registration receipt.
   (I)   An inspection officer’s attire shall contain the official city logo.
The inspection officer shall prominently display and present a city-issued
identification. If an occupant is present, the inspection officer shall
identify himself or herself, and the purpose of the inspection. The inspection
officer shall enter the premises only if permitted to do so.

the order was issued or counsel for the person to whom the order was issued is
present at the hearing, the Board of Public Works and Safety may not modify the
order so that it is more stringent than the Building Commissioner’s original
order.
   (J)   The findings made and action taken by the Board of Public Works and
Safety shall be in writing, and shall be available to the public upon request.
However, neither the Building Commissioner nor the Board of Public Works and
Safety is required to give any person notice of the findings and action, other
than those persons having a substantial property interest.
   (K)   If the Building Commissioner finds it necessary to take emergency
action concerning an unsafe premise in order to protect life, public safety or
property, he or she may take that action without issuing an order or giving
notice to any person having a substantial property interest. However, this
emergency action must be limited to removing any immediate danger. The action
shall be taken only when it is not feasible to give notice and hold hearings as
provided by division (C) of this section. Any person to whom such emergency
action is directed shall comply therewith, but shall be afforded a hearing
before the Board of Public Works and Safety as soon as possible.
   (L)   The Board of Public Works and Safety may recover the costs incurred by
taking emergency action, by filing a civil action in the Circuit or Superior
Court of Grant County against persons who held a fee interest, life estate
interest, or equitable interest of a contract purchaser in the unsafe premises
at the time the Building Commissioner found it necessary to take the emergency
action.
   (M)   Any person required to vacate an unsafe premise under the emergency
action of this section may challenge the emergency action to vacate in the
Circuit or Superior Courts of Grant County by challenging the Building
Commissioner’s determination that there is an immediate danger to life or
safety of any person. The Building Commissioner shall have the burden of
proving that an emergency action is necessary to prevent immediate danger to
the life and safety of any person occupying or using nearby property.
   (N)   If a cited violation is not corrected within the designated time
period and the Building Commissioner finds that the building is unsafe pursuant
to this chapter, the city may file a complaint with the Grant County Superior
Courts or Grant County Circuit Court to assess any fine provided by this
chapter, to seek an injunction as provided by state statute, or any sanction
allowed by this chapter or state statute.
   (O)   If a cited violation is not corrected within the designated time
period and the Building Commissioner does not find that the building is unsafe
within the meaning of this chapter, the city may file a complaint with Grant
County Superior Courts or the Grant County Circuit Court to assess any fine
provided by this section.
   (P)   Any rental unit for which the Building Department has issued an order
finding the building or premises to be unsafe shall be so designated and
placarded by the inspection officer.
   (Q)   No rental unit placarded as unsafe shall again be used for human
habitation until the written approval is secured from the Building Department,
the Board of Public Works and Safety, or a court of law. The inspection officer
shall remove the placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the finding
that the building is unsafe have been eliminated.
   (R)   No person shall deface or remove any notification of the inspection
officer that any rental unit has been declared unsafe for human habitation.
   (S)   The order of the Board of Public Works and Safety expires two years
after the notice of the order
is given unless one or more of the following events occurs within that two-year
period.
      (1)   A complaint requesting judicial review is filed by any party having
a substantial property interest.
      (2)   A contract for action required by the order is let at public bid.
      (3)   A civil action concerning the property is filed either by the city
or any person having a substantial property interest.

§ 150.99 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person who commits any of the following acts is subject to a fine
not to exceed $500. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate offense.
      (1)   A person who fails to obtain a registration receipt as required by
§
150.65;
      (2)   A person who fails to correct a violation cited in accordance with
this chapter, whether it makes the premises unsafe, or whether it violates this
chapter, a city ordinance or a state statue;
      (3)   A person who removes or defaces the notification of the inspection
officer that a rental unit has been determined to be unsafe.
   (B)   Any building or premises that is unsafe within the meaning of the
ordinance shall be subject to any other sanction provided by law, including,
but not limited to, injunctive relief or obtaining a performance bond to insure
the correction of any unsafe conditions.
   (C)   A person failing to comply with an order of the Board of Public Works
and Safety issued pursuant to this chapter in connection with an unsafe
building or premises may be subjected to any other sanction provided by the
ordinance.

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-
4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the city does hereby adopt the
following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 19-2014, passed 11-18-2014)
§ 151.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters.
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
      (6)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health.
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains.
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas.
(Ord. 19-2014, passed 11-18-2014)
§ 151.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevation or depths are shown.
      ZONE AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown
within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-
A30.)
      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses
are shown within this zone.
      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a
common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition,
which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-
bearing walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular
Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of
roads, or similar projects;
      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements, etc.;
      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling
operations;
      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
      (7)   Storage of materials; or
      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing
structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or
gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. Is a certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY and FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination
thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to as floodplain
regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and
floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for non-
residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations,
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest elevation described among the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure.
      (2)   The top of the basement floor.
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure.
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars.
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle."
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation
is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.

any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare
or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being
carried downstream.
   ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD. The flood that has a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An official republication of a community's FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain
boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Anything which is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULAR PROGRAM. The phase of the community's participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations
determined in a FIS.
   REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is
as defined in §
151.04(B). The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-
PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided
for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to
be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that
intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in
flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Marion subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the
City of Marion are generally identified as such on the Grant County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 9, 2014 as well
as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown
on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration
of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMS (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

§ 151.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of
Marion.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter's
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Grant County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated December 9, 2014 and the corresponding
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 9, 2014 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Marion, delineated as
an "A Zone" on the Grant County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated December 9, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall
be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be
applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements.
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the City
of Marion, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of
Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development
permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain
development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance
and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for
the City of Marion. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding
$2,500 or that set in §
10.99 of this code.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator, acting on behalf of the city, shall
inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood
Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Ord. 19-2014, passed 11-18-2014)
§ 151.05 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Designation of Administrator. The Common Council of the city hereby
appoints the Zoning Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of
this chapter and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.

      (6)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (7)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (8)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (9)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of §
151.06(A), all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from
flood damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any structure having a floor area
greater than 400 square feet.
         (b)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing structure (excluding the value of the land).
         (c)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred.
         (d)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days.
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning

structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of §
151.06(B)(4).
      (3)   Non-residential structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
§
151.06(B)(4). Structures located in all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu
of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in §
151.05(C)(12).
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements
of elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area).
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above
the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other

partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
         (f)   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
         (g)   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction
in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
         (h)   Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/
venting agreement acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood
vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will
violate the requirements of §
151.06,(B)(4). The affidavit shall be recorded in the office of the Grant
County Recorder.
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the
structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area
below the lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six
feet) shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community
will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement
shall be recorded in the office of the Grant County Recorder.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following:
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test showing
compliance shall be retained in the permit file.
         (b)   The fill shall extend 15 feet beyond the foundation of the
structure before sloping below the BFE.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
      (6)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as
a result of a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
151.06(B)(4).
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (b)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not
been substantially damaged by a flood:
            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §
151.06(B)(4).
            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days;
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as stated
earlier in this section.
      (7)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet
the following standards:
         (a)   Shall not be used for human habitation.
         (b)   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials.
         (c)   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum
resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (d)   Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the FPG.
         (f)   Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in §
151.06(B)(4).
      (8)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral
movement.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA
for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
151.04(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §
151.06 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
      (3)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the
efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse
affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the
regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 C.F.R. 65.12.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in §
151.06 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of

County, Indiana.
   (C)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter; and
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.

the community.
      (4)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.

development.
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site.
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
151.06(E) or (G)(1) may be granted.

Natural Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
151.06(B), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation (See §
151.07(E)).
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See §
151.07(E)).

      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by applicant

Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (F)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (G)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in §
151.07, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.

§ 152.035 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   From the standpoint of economy of time and money, it is recommended
that the subdivider consult early and informally with the Executive Director of
the Commission (hereinafter called “Director”) for advice and assistance. This
will enable the subdivider to become familiar with these and other regulations
as they affect the area and will prevent unnecessary and costly revisions. The
subdivider should present a sketch in inexpensive and tentative form showing,
in a general way, the proposed development, the exiting conditions within the
area proposed for subdivision and of surrounding lands, but this procedure is
not mandatory. This shall not require formal application, fee, or filing of a
preliminary plat, nor shall it be deemed a preliminary plat.

BOUNDARY AND LOT IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.070 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all
requirements contained in
§§ 152.050 et seq. of these regulations, including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of
debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the
Commission. At the expiration of the performance bond, the county may enforce
the provisions of the bond where compliance with the provisions of this section
or any other applicable law, ordinance, or regulation has not occurred.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on each of the created lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway
access to buildings on such lots from the appropriate approved street.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, and waterways.
      (2)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated.
         (a)   Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,600 feet
nor be less than 264 feet in length.
         (b)   Blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be less
than 1,000 feet in length or exceed 2,600 feet in length.
      (3)   In long blocks the Commission may require the reservation of
easements through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks not less than ten feet wide,
may be required by the Commission.
         (a)   Through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long or at other
appropriate locations.
         (b)   At the end of culs-de-sac where deemed essential to provide for
circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation, or other community facilities.
   (B)   Lot dimensions.
      (1)   General. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards in
the City of Marion Advisory Zoning Ordinance. Side lot lines shall be at right
angles to the street lines (or radial to curing street lines) unless a
variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of
corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing
the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth and width of properties
reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for all of the off-street parking and loading facilities
required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in
the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Waterbodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains
a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute
the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots.
         (a)   The Commission may approve an alternative allocation of
interests whereby the ownership and responsibility for safe maintenance of the
water body is so placed that it will not become a local government
responsibility.
         (b)   No part of the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning
Ordinance may be satisfied by land that is under water.
         (c)   Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from
the street from which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation
of a culvert or other structure of a design approved by the county or
jurisdictional engineer.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots. Double frontage
lots and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to
provide for the separation of residential development from the traffic on
bordering arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation affecting the subdivided lots.
      (2)   Access from primary and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access for a primary or secondary arterial street. Where
driveway access from a primary or secondary arterial street may be the only
possible access for several adjoining lots, the Commission may require that
such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards from multiple access to such streets. Where possible, driveways
should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into
traffic on primary or secondary arterials.
      (3)   Access to collector streets. Where possible, lots in single-family
residential subdivisions fronting on collector streets shall be avoided. Lots
at the corners of intersections between local and collector streets shall front
on the local street and have driveway access to it only, not to the collector
street. In multiple family residential areas entrances to group parking lots
shall have access only to collector streets (where possible) and such entrances
shall be widely spaced.
      (4)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to it be limited by one of the following means:
         (a)   The lots back onto the primary arterial. The lots front onto a
parallel local street. No access shall be provided from the primary arterial
and screening shall be provided within a strip of land along the rear property
line of such lots;
         (b)   A series of culs-de-sac, or loop streets entered from and
designed generally to be at right angles to an access street that is at some
distance from and parallel to the arterial street, with the rear lines of their
terminal lots backing onto the arterial;
         (c)   A marginal access or service road should be separated from the
primary arterial by a landscaped and/or decoratively fenced grass strip. The
access road shall be at widely spaced suitable points.
   (D)   Soil preservation, grading, and seeding.
      (1)   Soil preservation and final grading. No certificates of occupancy
shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the
approved construction plans.
         (a)   The lot shall be pre-covered with top soil having an average
depth of at least six inches which shall contain no particles over two inches
in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered by
buildings or included in the streets.
         (b)   The grade shall have not been changed or natural vegetation
seriously damaged. Topsoil that was removed from residential lots shall be
redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover between the
sidewalks and curbs and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
      (2)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm water drainage pattern for the area, and
drainage plans adopted by the Drainage Board or any participating jurisdiction.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid the accumulation of storm water on
any one or more lots from adjacent lots. It shall be the responsibility of the
lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for
in the approved construction plans.
      (3)   Lawn-grass seed and sod. No certificate of occupancy shall be
issued until re-spreading of soil and seeding of lawn have been completed;
except that between October 15 and March 15, the applicant shall submit an
agreement in writing to the Administrator signed by the developer and the
property owner that re-spreading of soil and seeding of the lawn will be done
during the immediately following planting season.
      (4)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks,
stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste material of any kind shall be
buried in any land or left or deposited on any area of the subdivision at the
time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public
improvements, whichever is sooner.

§ 152.114 NATURE OF STORM WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry away
by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as a result of the improvement(s). Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual,
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the jurisdiction's construction standards and specifications.
The purpose of this section is to establish minimum storm water management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public within the city MS4 area. This section seeks to meet
that purpose through the following objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      (2)   Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
      (4)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   This section shall be applicable to all subdivision, planned
development or other improvement location permit applications, unless eligible
for an exemption or granted a waiver by the Plan Commission under the
specifications of division (L) of this section. These standards apply to any
construction activity disturbing one acre or more of land. The following
activities may be exempt from these storm water performance criteria:
         (a)   Any forest harvesting or agricultural activity which is
consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan
prepared or approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, as
applicable.
         (b)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures;
         (c)   Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
unless such activities are part of a larger common plan of development; and
         (d)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary
by the Plan Commission.
      (2)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in division (C) of this section, decisions on
permitting and on-site storm water requirements shall be governed by special
storm water sizing criteria found in the current storm water design manual.
This criterion is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the
redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the Director of
Marion Utilities.

at the discretion of the local review authority, based on improvements in
engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Storm water
treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these
design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality
performance standards.
   (G)   Waivers to storm water management requirements.  
      (1)   Every applicant for an improvement location permit meeting the
applicability requirements under division (B) of this section shall provide for
storm water management as required by this section, unless a written request is
filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the storm water management
plan requirements shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for approval. The
minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in
part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the
following conditions applies:
         (a)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this section.
         (b)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the Plan Commission and the implementation of the plan is
required by local section.
         (c)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or
greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a
legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of
the storm water practice.
         (d)   The Plan Commission finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
         (e)   Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
            1.   The generation of storm water from the site;
            2.   The size and cost of storm water storage; and
            3.   The pollutants generated at the site.
These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the current design
manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be
determined by the Plan Commission.
      (2)   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Plan
Commission may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided.
However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission that the variance will not result in the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
         (a)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         (b)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (c)   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
         (d)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
property.
      (3)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for storm
water management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements
by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional storm
water authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         (a)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant
of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These
lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide
permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat,
         (b)   The creation of a storm water management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private,
that currently lack storm water management facilities designed and constructed
in accordance with the purposes and standards of this section,
         (c)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund storm water
management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland
delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macro
invertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species
studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of storm water management
practices.
   (H)   Fee in lieu of storm water management practices. Where the Plan
Commission waives all or part of the minimum storm water management
requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate storm
water facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant
shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the Plan
Commission. When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required storm water
management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule (unless the developer and the storm water authority agree on a
greater alternate contribution) established by the Plan Commission, and based
on the cubic feet of storage required for storm water management of the
development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to
an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the
developer prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development.
   (I)   Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant
may obtain a waiver of the required storm water management by entering into an
agreement with the Plan Commission for the granting of an easement or the
dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-
site storm water management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by
the applicant and the Plan Commission prior to the recording of plats or, if no
record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the improvement location
permit.
   (J)   General performance criteria for storm water management. Unless judged
by the Plan Commission to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all
sites:
      (1)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices
to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with
specified design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These
practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and
to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking
lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment
for both water quality and quantity.
      (2)   All storm water runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the (jurisdictional storm water authority). In no case
shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp
of Engineers (ACE) or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (3)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual
recharge from pre-development site conditions.
      (4)   For new development, structural storm water treatment practices
shall be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total
suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
         (a)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQV);
         (b)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in the local storm water design manual;
         (c)   Constructed properly; and
         (d)   Maintained regularly.
      (5)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criteria, shall be provided as prescribed in the Indiana Handbook
for Erosion Control in Developing Areas (most recent version).
      (6)   Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices.
      (7)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
storm water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
      (8)   Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
      (9)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the
(jurisdictional storm water authority) to determine if they are subject to
additional storm water design requirements.
      (10)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the County
Storm Drainage Manual shall be used for sizing all storm water management
practices.
   (K)   Basic storm water management design criteria.
      (1)   Minimum control requirements. All storm water management practices
will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g.,
recharge, water quality, channel protection, 10- year, 100-year) as identified
in the current County Storm Drainage Manual or Indiana Handbook for Erosion
Control in Developing Areas are met, unless the Plan Commission grants the
applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In
addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than
that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Plan Commission reserves
the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to
control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
      (2)   Site design feasibility. Storm water management practices for a
site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the
factors that should be considered:
         (a)   Topography;
         (b)   Maximum drainage area;
         (c)   Depth to water table;
         (d)   Soils;
         (e)   Slopes;
         (f)   Terrain;
         (g)   Head; and
         (h)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas.
Applicants shall consult the County Storm Drainage Manual for guidance on the
factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a storm water
management practice.
      (3)   Conveyance issues. All storm water management practices shall be
designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
         (b)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
         (c)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
         (d)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
The County Storm Drainage Manual and the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control
in Developing Areas shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for
conveyance for each of the approved storm water management practices.
      (4)   Pretreatment requirements. Every storm water treatment practice
shall have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment, in accordance with
the pretreatment requirements found in the Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control
in Developing Areas. Certain storm water treatment practices are prohibited
even with pretreatment in the following circumstances:
         (a)   Storm water is generated from highly contaminated source areas
known as "hotspots";
         (b)   Storm water is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, non-storm water discharges;
         (c)   Storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater
recharge area; and
         (d)   Certain geologic conditions exist that prohibit the proper
pretreatment of storm water.
      (5)   Treatment/geometry conditions. All storm water management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat storm water runoff according to the
specifications outlined in the County Storm Drainage Manual and Indiana
Handbook for Erosion Control in Developing Areas. These specifications will
designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to an
approved storm water management practice.
      (6)   Landscaping plans required. All storm water management practices
must have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the
practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan
must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or soil conservation
district.
      (7)   Maintenance agreements. All storm water treatment practices shall
have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance
easements required to access and inspect the storm water treatment practices,
and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of
the storm water treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant
specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm
water treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for
land disturbance activities.
      (8)   Non-structural storm water practices. The use of non-structural
storm water treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance
on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of
storm water that must be managed can be earned through the use of non-
structural practices that reduce the generation of storm water from the site.
These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the current design
manual and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural
practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered
by subsequent property owners.
   (L)   Requirements for storm water management plan approval.
      (1)   Storm water management plan required for all developments. No
application for an improvement location permit, subdivision plat or planned
development will be approved unless it includes a storm water management plan
detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting
from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be prepared
by an individual approved by the Plan Commission and must indicate whether
storm water will be managed on-site or off-site and, if on-site, the general
location and type of practices.
      (2)   Storm water management concept plan requirements. A storm water
management concept plan shall be required with all permit applications and will
include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential
impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on
the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures
proposed for managing storm water generated at the project site. The following
information shall be included in the concept plan:
         (a)   A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural storm water management
and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed
land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to
various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements;
the limits of clearing and grading. A written description of the site plan and
justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required;
         (b)   Sufficient engineering analysis to show that the proposed storm
water management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in
compliance with this section and the specifications of the County Storm
Drainage Manual;
         (c)   A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the
site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project
and a description of the watershed and its relation to the project site. This
description should include a discussion of soil conditions, vegetation cover,
topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular
attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development.
         (d)   A written description of the required maintenance burden for any
proposed storm water management facility.
         (e)   The Plan Commission may also require a concept plan to consider
the maximum development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless
of whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum
potential; and
         (f)   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously
developed site, an applicant shall be required to include within the storm
water concept plan measures for controlling existing storm water runoff
discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this section to
the maximum extent practicable.
      (3)   Final storm water management plan requirements. After review of the
storm water management concept plan, and modifications to that plan as deemed
necessary by the Plan Commission, a final storm water management plan must be
submitted for approval. The final storm water management plan, in addition to
the information from the concept plan, shall include all of the following
information:
         (a)   Contact information, including the name, address, and telephone
number of all persons having a legal interest in the property and the tax
reference number and parcel number of the property or properties affected;
         (b)   Topographic base map. A 1" = 100' topographic base map of the
site which extends a minimum of 100 feet beyond the limits of the proposed
development and indicates existing surface water drainage including streams,
ponds, culverts, ditches, and wetlands; current land use including all existing
structures; locations of utilities, roads, and easements; and significant
natural and manmade features not otherwise shown;
         (c)   Calculations. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for
the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storms
specified in this section. Such calculations shall include description of the
design storm frequency, intensity and duration, time of concentration, soil
curve numbers or runoff coefficients, peak runoff rates and total runoff
volumes for each watershed area, infiltration rates, where applicable, culvert
capacities, flow velocities, data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff
for the design storms referenced in the Storm Water Design Manual, and
documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test results.
         (d)   Soils information. If a storm water management control measure
depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then
a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site
boring logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of required soil
borings or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine
the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the
control measure.
         (e)   Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of all
storm water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair
procedures to ensure their continued function. These plans will identify the
parts or components of a storm water management facility that need to be
maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for
the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance
program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall
be included in the plan.
         (f)   Landscaping plan. The applicant must present a detailed plan for
management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished, including
who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is
preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by
the soil conservation district.
         (g)   Maintenance easements. The applicant must ensure access to all
storm water treatment practices at the site for the purpose of inspection and
repair by securing all the maintenance easements needed on a permanent basis.
These easements will be recorded with the plan and will remain in effect even
with transfer of title to the property.
         (h)   Maintenance agreement. The applicant must execute an easement
and an inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of
land served by an on-site storm water management measure in accordance with the
specifications of this section.
         (i)   Erosion and sediment control plans for construction of storm
water management measures. The applicant must prepare an erosion and sediment
control plan for all construction activities related to implementing any on-
site storm water management practices.
         (j)   Other environmental permits. The applicant shall assure that all
other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to
approval of the final storm water design plan.
         (k)   Performance bond/security.
            1.   The Plan Commission may, at its discretion, require the
submittal of a performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in
order to insure that the storm water practices are installed by the permit
holder as required by the approved storm water management plan. The amount of
the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction
cost of the storm water management practices approved under the permit, plus
25%. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure
to complete work specified in the storm water management plan.
            2.   The installation performance security shall be released in
full only upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a
registered professional engineer that the storm water practice has been
installed in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions
of this section. The Plan Commission will make a final inspection of the storm
water practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and
the provisions of this section. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of
the performance security based on the completion of various development stages
can be done at the discretion of the Plan Commission.
   (M)   Construction inspection.
      (1)   Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the
Plan Commission in advance before the commencement of construction. Regular
inspections of the storm water management system construction shall be
conducted by the staff of the Plan Commission or certified by a professional
engineer or their designee who has been approved by the jurisdictional storm
water authority. All inspections shall be documented and written reports
prepared that contain the following information:
         (a)   The date and location of the inspection;
         (b)   Whether construction is in compliance with the approved storm
water management plan;
         (c)   Variations from the approved construction specifications; and
         (d)   Any violations that exist. If any violations are found, the
property owner shall be notified in writing of the ature of the violation and
the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any
violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received
approval by the Plan Commission.
      (2)   As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-
built"plans for any storm water management practices located on-site after
final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design
specifications for all storm water management facilities and must be certified
by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the Plan Commission is
required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
      (3)   Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from
which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared
or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from
the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following
criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
         (a)   Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over 90% of the seeded area;
         (b)   Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable
of controlling erosion;
         (c)   Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
75% of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation;
and
         (d)   Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the
minimum 75% survival for one year is achieved.
In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted
with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management
techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan will
explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who
will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is
preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by
the soil conservation district, and must be approved prior to receiving a
permit.
   (N)   Maintenance and repair of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has
a storm water management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the storm
water management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the
facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the Plan Commission, or
their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property
owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to
meet design standards and any other provisions established by this section. The
easement agreement shall be recorded by the Plan Commission in the land
records.
      (2)   Maintenance covenants.  
         (a)   Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be
approved by the Plan Commission and recorded into the land record prior to
final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for
when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the
storm water management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for
periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between
scheduled cleanouts. The Plan Commission, in lieu of a maintenance covenant,
may accept dedication of any existing or future storm water management facility
for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this
chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by
easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
         (b)   Requirements for maintenance covenants. All storm water
management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to
document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the
requirements of this section and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs
may include: removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins,
inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary
replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be
addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the Plan Commission, and the
inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to
ensure proper functioning of the storm water management facility.
      (3)   Inspection of storm water facilities. Inspection programs may be
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or
pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES storm
water permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other storm water
treatment practices.
      (4)   Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control
facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made
between private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer
or combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the Plan Commission the
right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for
the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it
has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this section is occurring
or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance
or correction of a violation of this section.
      (5)   Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water management
facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and
repairs, and shall retain the records for at least ten years. These records
shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility and at
other reasonable times upon request.
      (6)   Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or
refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the Plan
Commission, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the
facility in proper working condition. In the event that the storm water
management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the
Plan Commission shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the storm
water management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the
responsible person shall have ten days to effect maintenance and repair of the
facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the Plan Commission may
assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any
penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or
prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the
tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the county.

§ 152.115 DEDICATION OF DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (A)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
course, drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way shall be provided, granted or dedicated to the county or
appropriate jurisdiction conforming to the line of such watercourse. The width
and construction of both shall be adequate for the purpose of drainage
maintenance.
      (1)   Where possible the drainage shall be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   No building may be permitted within 75 feet of any legal drain,
unless written variance from the Drainage Board is granted.
   (B)   Drainage easements.
      (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
then perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the rights-of-way
lines and with satisfactory access to the street.
         (a)   Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
         (b)   Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
      (2)   The applicant shall dedicate by drainage or conservation easement
land on both sides of exiting watercourses of a width to be determined by the
Commission and, in the case of legal drains, the County Drainage Board.
      (3)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat before final approval is granted.
      (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be included in
the computations for determining the number of lots allowable under average
density procedures nor for computing the area requirement for any individual
lot.

§ 152.267 INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT.
   (A)   Public provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute or other
provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any
other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever

restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
      (2)   Where the provision of the easement, covenant, or private agreement
or restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher
standards than the requirements of this chapter and such private provisions are
not inconsistent with this chapter or determinations thereunder, then such

§ 152.272 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision
regulations. Such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations. The Commission shall not approve variances
unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other nearby property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner contradict the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or Official Map as interpreted by the
Commission and the jurisdictional engineer;
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will secure the objectives of the standards or requirements of
these regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. An approved petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat
application is filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
   (D)   Modifications. Variance modifications must be submitted in writing to
the Commission. These modifications shall be referred immediately to the
appropriate participating jurisdiction for their approval or rejection. If such
participating jurisdiction approves of such modifications in writing, or fails
to either approve or disapprove within 30 days after the same has been referred
to them, the Commission may modify such requirements, standards and
specifications so as to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, and
prevent detriment to the use and value of said land. However, nothing herein
shall be construed as altering or conflicting with the powers and duties of the
Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-900, as amended. No authority
to modify shall exist in the Commission if the appropriate participating
jurisdiction by writing disapproves such modification.

§ 153.002 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience and general welfare.
   (B)   It is not the intent of this chapter nor should it be the result of
this chapter that any usage of land existing at the time or prior to the
passage of this chapter which was illegal or unlawful under former zoning
ordinances or regulations should become legal or lawful under the terms of this
chapter.
(1985 Code, § 36-7-4-600(1.2))
§ 153.003 NONINTERFERENCE WITH GREATER RESTRICTIONS OTHERWISE IMPOSED.
   It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul
any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties, nor to interfere
with or abrogate or annul any ordinance, other than expressly repealed hereby,
rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued and not in conflict
with any of the provisions of this chapter or which shall be adopted or
provided, except that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the
use of buildings or land or upon the height of buildings or requires larger
open spaces or greater lot area per family than are required or imposed by such
easements, covenants or agreements between parties or by such ordinances,
rules, regulations or permits, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
This provision shall not be construed to require that the Commission shall
administer any easement, covenant or other agreement, unless expressly provided
herein.
(1985 Code, § 36-7-4-600(1.3))
§ 153.004 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

may total not more than 50% of the total gross floor area coverage of the lot.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use incidental, related, appropriate and clearly
subordinate to the main use of the lot or building, which accessory use does
not alter the principal use of the subject lot or affect other properties in
the district.
   ADVERTISING STRUCTURE. Any structure used as an outdoor display, designed
for or upon which there is a notice or advertisement, pictorial or otherwise,
regardless of size and shape, for the purposes of making anything known, the
origin or sale of which is not on the property with such advertising structure.

of nonconforming uses shall be measured from the date of such reclassification
or change. The advertising sign structure must remain substantially (90%) the
same as it was on the effective date of the provisions of this chapter as
amended. Reasonable repair and maintenance of the advertising sign structure
not to exceed 10% of the current annual replacement cost, including changing of
the advertising message, is not a change, which would terminate nonconforming
rights.

§ 153.005 NONCONFORMING USE SPECIFICATIONS.
   The lawful use of a building or premises, existing on December 15, 1971, may
be continued although such use does not conform to all the provisions thereof,
except as hereinafter provided.
   (A)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout a building, provided no
structural alterations are made therein, except those required by law.
   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or greater restrictions, provided no structural changes are made in the
building. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use or
to a use permitted in a district of greater restrictions, it shall not
thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use of a less restricted district.
   (C)   No building shall be erected upon any premises devoted to a
nonconforming use, except in conformance with this chapter.
   (D)   No nonconforming mobile home may be removed and replaced unless the
new mobile home complies with all use and district requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been issued before the effective date of this chapter and the construction of
which has been diligently prosecuted within 90 days of the date of such permit,
and which entire building shall be completed according to such plans within one
year of the effective date of this chapter.
   (F)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or premises is
discontinued for a period of one year, the use of same shall thereafter conform
to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (G)   When a building containing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire,
explosion, act of God or the public enemy to more than 80% of its insured value
and is not rebuilt within one year it shall not be restored except in
conformity with the regulations of the district within which it is located.
   (H)   These provisions apply in the same manner to a use which may become a
nonconforming use due to a later amendment to this chapter.
   (I)   Any nonconforming open use of land shall be discontinued on or before
December 15, 1976.
   (J)   A nonconforming building, nonconforming only as to the yard
regulations, may not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the additions
or enlargements conform to all the requirements of the district in which it is
located; provided however, that said additions or enlargements may be located
in a required yard if they do not encroach into any portion of any required
yard to a greater extent than the existing nonconforming building encroaches
therein, but in no event shall any such additions or enlargements reduce the
width of a side yard or the depth of a front or rear yard to less than 50% of
that required by the yard requirements of the district in which the lot is
located, and the total of all such additions or enlargements so encroaching
into any required yard shall not exceed in height or length the height or
length of that portion of the adjoining nonconforming building which extends

   (K)   No change of use may be on any parcel or in any structure, not
including any change in structure or physical character of the parcel or
structure, prior to the issuance by the Zoning Administrator of a change of use
permit. A change of use permit shall be required when a substitution of a
nonconforming use occurs or when use changes between major SIC Code groups
occur. If a change of use results in a change of structure requiring an
improvement location permit pursuant to this chapter, the new use shall meet
all district and use requirements of this chapter.

§ 153.021 DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICTS.
   The Districts identified above are described as follows.
   (A)   Agriculture District. The AG District is established in recognition of
agriculture as the predominant and basic use of land throughout much of the
city and for the conservation thereof. Permitted uses in these districts
include all forms of agricultural uses, plus special exceptions as indicated in
Appendix A.
   (B)   Residential Districts. Six districts, RS, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, are
established for residential use in conformity with the types of neighborhoods,
which have occurred, and are likely to develop in the areas so designated on
the Zone Maps. The Districts differ primarily with respect to requirements of
lot size, building ground floor area, and the number of families which may be
housed in one building. The specific requirements for each residential district
are discussed in §
153.041. Various uses permitted within each district are shown in Appendix A.
      (1)   RS.   This single-family district has been established principally
to include lands that are generally characterized by two or more of the
following conditions: substantial differences in topographic relief; extensive
tree cover; heavy mucky or easily erodable soils; unusual drainage
characteristics; outside areas of utility development; or are currently being
developed in a distinctive pattern not adaptable to the customary manner of
subdividing land for residential purposes. Requirements for minimum lot sizes
and ground floor areas of structures are substantially greater than those of
the other residential districts.
      (2)   R1.   This is a single-family, low-density residential district.
The minimum lot size and building area are less than the RS District. R1
Districts usually include new and developing single- family neighborhoods and
subdivisions.
      (3)   R2.   This district is primarily a medium density single-family
district. The R2 requirements as to minimum lots and ground floor area of
buildings are less than those specified for residential districts RS and R1.
This district frequently applies to existing residential neighborhoods and
comparable expansions thereof.
      (4)   R3.   This district is established to include areas of relatively
low density two-family and multiple-family residences permitted on a density of
use basis, with the minimum lot size being increased for more than one family
in a building. Single-family residences are also permitted on a density basis
somewhat higher than R2 Districts. The R3 requirements as to minimum lot and
ground flood area of buildings are less than those for residential districts
RS, R1, and R2.
      (5)   R4.   This is a medium density residential district with single,
two-family, and multiple family residences permitted. The minimum lot and
ground floor requirements are substantially less than those for residential
districts RS, R1, R2, and R3.
      (6)   R5.   This is relatively high-density residential district with all
types of residential development permitted. The minimum lot and ground floor
requirements are the lowest of any residential district.
   (C)   Commercial Districts. Seven commercial districts, PB, AB, LB, CB, CC,
GB, and SC, are established to meet the specific requirements for the several
classes of business uses needed to give adequate service throughout the city as
related to present and future development.
      (1)   PB.   This district is established as a buffer, generally between
commercial and residential districts permitting selected professional and
business uses having limited contact with the public.
      (2)   AB. This district is established to include areas that are in close
proximity to expressway interchanges or recreation uses and at appropriate
intervals along major thoroughfares and are designed to provide uses
appropriate to the limited accommodation and service needs of these areas.
      (3)   LB.   District LB is designed and located in neighborhoods to
accommodate the primary and service needs of the locality. Although limited in
area occupied, the district is important to the economic welfare of the
community in placing “convenience” and “impulse” goods shops close to the
consumer.
      (4)   CB.   The CB District is established to include areas that are
intended to serve as the Central Business District for urban places.
      (5)   CC. This is a special district, applicable to the Central Core of
the downtown. It is established to provide for the special needs of this area,
by waving certain requirements in regard to parking, sign regulations and the
like, which are necessary in other commercial districts.
      (6)   GB. This is a general business district providing for all types of
business and service uses, including warehouse and storage facilities as well
as some light industrial operations.
      (7)   SC.   This district provides for the need for retail shopping
facilities in planned shopping centers in developing commercial areas of the
municipalities. SC districts shall frequently include completely planned
shopping environments in single ownership.
   (D)   Industrial Districts. Three districts, I1, I2, and I3, are established
to meet the present and future needs of the city for industrial development
operations, including some ancillary services for industry and employees. A
brief description of the industrial districts follows.
      (1)   I1.   This district incorporates many of the existing industrial
developments and provides for their expansion. Generally, the permitted uses
will include only those where all of the operations, including the storage of
material, are confined within a building and the performance characteristics
are compatible with uses permitted in neighboring districts.
      (2)   I2.   This district is established to provide for general
industrial operations utilizing both enclosed and unenclosed space for storage,
fabricating and manufacturing.
      (3)   I3. This district is established to provide for general industrial
operations in the processing of raw materials for the production of basic
commodities.
   (E)   Airport Zone District. The AZ District is established to be applied to
the city’s Municipal Airport. Certain commercial and industrial operations may
be permitted by special exception.
   (F)   Mobile Home Park Districts. This district is established to provide
for mobile home parks with exclusive occupancy by mobile homes as residences.

§ 153.022 ZONE MAP.
   (A)   Zone Map. The Zone Maps, which accompany this chapter, show the
boundaries of and the area covered by the districts. These maps are
incorporated by reference into this chapter, with two copies being on file in
the office of the City Clerk and available for public inspection. The
notations, references, indications and other matters shown on the Zone Maps are
as much a part hereof as if they were fully described herein.
   (B)   Boundaries: in general.
      (1)   The boundaries of the districts established by this section are as
shown on the Zone Maps, which are a part of this chapter. Such boundaries may
be changed only by amending this chapter.
      (2)   The exact location of split zone boundaries in regards to
individual tracts of land shall be determined as follows.
         (a)   When the exact boundaries of a district are uncertain, they
shall be determined by use of the scale of the Zone Map.
         (b)   When a right-of-way is vacated, the districts adjoining each
side are respectively extended to the center of the area so vacated.
         (c)   If the boundary line of a district divides a lot having frontage
on a street so that the front part of the lot lies in one district and part of
the lot lies in another, the restriction that applies to the front part of the
lot applies to the entire lot.
         (d)   If the boundary line of a district divides a lot in a manner
essentially perpendicular to a street, that restriction which applies to the
larger part of the lot applies to the entire lot.
         (e)   If the boundary of a district divides a through lot, the
district that applies to the greater frontage applies to the entire lot, except
that if one frontage is designed arterial, the district of that frontage shall
apply. If the frontage is equal, the Board shall determine the intent of the
Zone Map.
         (f)   In the case of further uncertainty, the Board shall interpret
the intent of Zone Map as to the location of the boundary in question.
      (3)   In the event of annexation of lands to the city or a town, the
zoning classification existing at the time of annexation shall remain until
changed by amendment procedures.
   (C)   Boundaries: in Shopping Center Districts. Boundaries in Shopping
Center Districts are affixed by the Commission and posted by it on the Zone
Map. Each such District shall be at least six acres in area and some part of it
shall be within 1400 feet of the location corresponding to the location of an
SC symbol shown on the Zone Map. The location of such a symbol may be changed
only by amending this chapter.

lot area required.
      (2)   Where a lot has a minimum width or depth less than that prescribed
by this section, and said lot was of record under one ownership at the time
that the area was first zoned whereby the lot became nonconforming, said lot
may be used subject to all other requirements of the district in which such lot
is located.
   (C)   Ground floor. The ground floor area requirements for dwellings, as set
forth in the districts, shall apply. Dwellings shall not be changed except in
conformity with these regulations.
   (D)   Building height. All buildings hereafter designed or erected and

         (e)   Lamp posts.
         (f)   Mail boxes.
         (g)   Name plates.
         (h)   Parking spaces, provided however that such spaces shall not be
calculated as part of any required off-street parking spaces and that they
shall be connected to an access way or driveway to the required off-street
parking or other parking spaces not in the required front yard.
         (i)   Utility installations for local service (such as poles, lines,
hydrants and telephone booths).
         (j)   Retaining walls.
         (k)   Trees, shrubs, plants and flowers.
         (l)   Walks.
      (2)   Accessory to the residential use of land shall be the keeping of
four or fewer dogs or other small animals normally kept as pets and at least
six months old, not including indoor caged pets.
      (3)   Residential accessory uses shall include garages, sheds, pools,
patio decks, guesthouses and other structures.
   (B)   Setbacks of accessory buildings in residential districts. If an
interior lot abuts a corner lot or alley separating them and the front yards of
the two lots are perpendicular to each other, an accessory building on the rear
lot line of the corner lot may be located no closer to the street abutting the
interior lot than the principal building on the interior lot, but no closer
than five feet.
   (C)   Restrictions along streams.
      (1)   No structure other than a fence may be erected and, if erected in
violation of this section, no
such structure may be used if the location of the structure is within 75 feet
of the meander, or high- water, line of any stream shown on the Zone Map.
      (2)   Within the areas covered by the restrictions imposed by subsection
(1), no use is permitted other than the following, and upon application for an
improvement location permit if required under this chapter:
         (a)   Agricultural uses;
         (b)   Forestry;
         (c)   Public utilities;
         (d)   Recreation, not including buildings.
      (3)   Such application for an improvement location permit shall be
accompanied by a letter from the County Drainage Board stating that the
proposed use is in accord with the provisions of the Indiana Drainage Code
(I.C. 36-9-27).
   (D)   Land filling standards.
      (1)   All plot plans, submitted to the Plan Commission for approval,
under the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and this chapter, shall provide
for the collection and management of all storm and surface water drainage. The
drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer to provide
for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subject real property and
the drainage area of which it is a part. The system shall be constructed and
installed in accordance with this chapter, the Comprehensive Plan and the
requirements of the Plan Commission. (See §§
152.114 and
152.115). The filling of lands not included in a flood hazard area is
permitted, provided all requirements of state statute and regulations (for
example, 329 I.A.C. 2-3) are met. Violations of this section and regulation
shall be referred to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for enforcement. In order to insure the
maintenance of a properly designed and installed drainage system, the following
divisions shall be required as a provision of the restrictive covenants of all
recorded plats and plot plan approvals.
         (a)   Drainage swales (ditches) along dedicated roadways and within
the right-of-way, or on dedicated drainage easements, are not to be altered,
dug out, filled in, tiled, or otherwise changed without the written permission
of the Plan Commission. Property owners must maintain these swales as sodded
grass-ways, or other non-eroding surfaces. Water from roofs of parking areas
must be contained on the property long enough so that said drainage swales or
ditches will not be damaged by such water. Driveways may be constructed over
these swales or ditches only when appropriate sized culverts or other approved
structures have been permitted by the City Engineer. Culverts must be
protected, especially at the ends, by head walls or metal end sections, and, if
damaged enough to retard the water flow, must be replaced.
         (b)   Any property owner altering, changing, or damaging these
drainage swales or ditches will be held responsible for such action and will be
given ten days notice by registered mail to repair said damage, after which
time, if no action is taken, the city will cause said repairs to be
accomplished, and the bill for such repairs will be sent to the affected
property owners for immediate payment.
      (2)   General drainage considerations. The purpose of this division is to
protect the safety, health, and general welfare of the citizens of the city by
requiring compliance with accepted standards and best practices for storm water
drainage. (See §§
152.114 and
152.115). This division does not create any liability on the part of the city,
the Plan Commission, or any elected or appointed official or employee thereof,
for any damages that result from reliance on this division or any alterations
required to conform to the engineering requirements established hereunder or
any administrative decisions lawfully made thereunder. Any land alteration must
be accomplished in conformity with the drainage requirements. Where any
apparent conflict exists between drainage requirements of this chapter and
similar requirements of any state or federal agency which has jurisdiction of
the work involved, the most stringent requirements shall be applicable and
compliance with this chapter shall not excuse non-compliance with any other
applicable provision of law, ordinance, or regulation.
   (E)   Miscellaneous residential restrictions.
      (1)   In an RS, R1, R2, R3, R4, or R5 District.
         (a)   An accessory building may not be erected before the principal
building, except on a farm; and
         (b)   Other than provided in division (A) of this section, all
accessory buildings and structures shall be erected in a side or rear yard.
         (c)   In the case of a through lot, the area at each end of the lot
between the setback line and the middle of the street shall be treated as if it
were part of the front yard.

   (F)   Advertising sign structures eligible for characterization as legal
nonconforming. Any advertising sign structure located within the city
jurisdiction on the date of adoption of this chapter which does not conform to
the provisions of this chapter is eligible for characterization as a legal
nonconforming advertising sign structure and is permitted, provided it also
meets the following requirements:
      (1)   The advertising sign structure was covered by an advertising sign
structure permit or variance on the date of adoption of this section if one was
required under applicable law, or, if no advertising sign structure permit was
required under applicable law for the advertising sign structure in question,
the advertising sign structure was in all respects in conformity with the

nonconforming sign shall retain such status in perpetuity subject to normal
maintenance and reduction.
   (G)   If land is annexed to the City of Marion subsequent to the effective
date of this chapter, any signs which do not conform to this chapter at such
time shall have legal nonconforming status if:
      (1)   Under applicable federal, state, and county regulations, the sign
was legal in all respects immediately prior to annexation;
      (2)   The sign is a permanent sign; and
      (3)   The annexation was not conditioned upon the removal or modification

replaced;
      (3)   The permit, variance, or condition under which the advertising

         (b)   The size of the advertising structure is increased;
         (c)   The use changes.
   (I)   In order to maintain and continue a legally nonconforming advertising

is located.
      (3)   The advertising structure must remain substantially the same as it
was on the effective date with the provisions of this chapter as amended.

      (4)   The legally nonconforming advertising structure and/or sign may be
sold, leased, or otherwise transferred without affecting its status, but its
location may not be changed.
      (5)   A legally nonconforming advertising sign structure removed as a

nonconforming advertising structure, or legally nonconforming portion of the
structure, whichever the case may be, provided that the sign area existing when
it became legally nonconforming shall not be increased. There are exceptions to
actual existence as follows.
         (a)   Where a permit or variance was granted for the construction of
an advertising structure prior to the effective date of passage and the
advertising sign structure owner acted in good faith and expended sums in
reliance thereon. This exception shall not apply in instances where large
numbers of permits were applied for and issued to a single sign owner,
obviously in anticipation of the passage of the sign ordinance amendment
governing advertising structure.
         (b)   The legally nonconforming advertising structure may continue as
long as it is not destroyed, abandoned, or discontinued. If permitted by the
sign ordinance and re-erected in kind, exception may be made for nonconforming

tortious acts.
         (c)   Any legally non-conforming advertising structure, which for a
designated period of time of six months displays obsolete advertising matter or

advertising structure damaged in excess of 60% of its replacement cost shall be
considered destroyed.
         (d)   Where an existing legally nonconforming advertising structure
ceases to display advertising matter, a reasonable period of time to replace
advertising content is established by the sign ordinance. Where new content is
not put on a structure within 30 days after the passage of the designated
period of time of six months, the use of the structure as a nonconforming
outdoor advertising sign structure is terminated and shall constitute an
abandonment or discontinuance. This established period may be waived for an
involuntary discontinuance such as the closing of a local road or state highway
for repair in front of the advertising sign structure.
         (e)   All signs and advertising structures shall conform to the
requirements of both this chapter and “The Highway Advertising Control Act of
1967,” as amended; and should the two be in conflict with each other, the
requirements of the more restricting shall apply. “The Highway Advertising
Control Act of 1967” affects all Federal Aid Primary Highways as established by
the State Highway Commission.
      (J)   Any advertising structure which is in violation of this chapter and
which is in existence and installed upon the date of enactment of the ordinance
codified in this chapter shall be removed or altered so as to comply with this
chapter at the property owner’s expense and as otherwise provided by law.
   (K)   Illegal advertising structure, statement of installation date:
      (1)   Any lessor or lessee of property to which a nonconforming sign or
structure is attached shall furnish to the Director of Planning, upon request
in writing, the date of the erection or installation of such sign or
advertising sign structure;
      (2)   A false statement knowingly given by the lessor or lessee or
failure to apply and/or furnish such information within ten days constitutes a
waiver of any rights granted to any property owner, lessor or lessee as to the
maintenance of any nonconforming sign or advertising sign structure by this
chapter and such sign or advertising sign structure shall be removed or altered
to conform within 30 days after demand that such be done in writing by the
Director regardless of the ownership or the date of installation of such sign
or advertising sign structure;

conform within 30 days by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (L)   Any advertising sign structure not meeting such requirements is an
unlawful sign.
   (M)   After notice and public hearing, any sign permit granted in accordance
with the provisions of this section may be revoked upon a finding by the Board
of Zoning Appeals that the sign or sign program for which the permit was
granted advertises the availability or sale of goods, property, or services no
longer available, or is constructed, installed, or maintained in a manner that
is not in accordance with the approved application.
   (N)   Abandonment shall be the voluntary act of the lessee and/or lessor to
discontinue the use of a sign and/or structure for a period of 90 days or more.
An abandoned nonconforming structure may be occupied, and the nonconforming

   (A)   Purpose. In addition to the zoning districts listed and their
associated regulations set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, additional
regulations and requirements are imposed upon the State Route 18 Corridor and
the interchange of SR18 and I-69 interchange, more commonly known as the I-69
Corridor Overlay Zone, or "Overlay Zone". In said Overlay Zone, the city
desires to enhance the visual appearance and image of the corridor and
interchange and advance the public welfare through the resulting benefits to
the economy and quality of life for the city. The intersection of Interstate 69
and State Route 18 form an important entrance point and gateway corridor to the
City of Marion. The city recognizes the importance of SR 18 as a thoroughfare
for regional traffic, the impact its character has on the image of the
community, and the need to provide restrictions and guidelines in order to
enhance the visual appearance and image of the Corridor.

Township.
         (b)   East: 200 feet east of the centerline of County Road 700E in
Monroe Township.
      (2)   Along I-69: The boundaries extend approximately one-half mile on
either side of I-69 bounded more specifically by the following:
         (a)   North: the centerline of County Road 100N.
         (b)   East: a line measured 200 feet east of, and parallel to, the
centerline of County Road 700E.
         (c)   South: a line measured 2,640 feet south of, and parallel to, the
centerline of SRI 8.
         (d)   West: a line measured 200 feet west of, and parallel to, the
centerline of County Road 600E.
   (C)   Applicability. The restrictions, regulations, and guidelines on
development and construction set forth by the Overlay Zone shall apply to the
following:

and therefore increases potential square footage for construction.
      (2)   Parking lot and other surfaced elements. Natural filtration of
water through soil is the simplest way to control the volume of run-off and
pollutants associated with run-off, which is a direct advantage of permeable
pavement. Therefore, all surface areas constructed with permeable pavement
materials, including porous asphalt, porous concrete, plastic grid systems, or
block pavers are not counted towards the impervious surface cover calculations
and therefore increase potential square footage of impervious construction.
   (D)   Architectural design requirements. In reviewing the architectural
design of a building(s) proposed to be built in the Overlay Zone, factors to be
considered by the Overlay Committee and the Commission shall include but are
not limited to:

but shall not occupy more than 50% of the entire area on any side of the
building. If an approach driveway cuts into a planting area adjacent to the
building, additional planting area equal to the area displaced by the driveway
shall be added to the building perimeter planting. These perimeter planting
areas need not be rectangular in shape as long as the required total area is
landscaped and dispersed on at least three different sides of the building.
      (5)   Property perimeter plantings. A property perimeter planting area
shall be a minimum of five feet in width and shall be provided along the common
perimeter of the property except for frontage areas. Perimeter planting areas
are not in addition to the required yard areas. Perimeter property plantings

created and established certain surfaces and areas which include all of the
land lying beneath the noise sensitive area, approach surfaces, transitional
surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Marion
Municipal Airport. Such surfaces are shown on Marion Municipal Airport
Imaginary Surfaces Map, Airport Height Restrictions Map, and Airport Noise
Sensitive Area Map consisting of three sheets, and dated May 10, 2010 which is
attached to this chapter and is made a part hereof. For height limitation
purposes, an area located in more than one of the following surfaces is
considered to be only in the surface with the more restrictive height
limitation.
   (B)   The various surfaces are established and defined as follows.
      (1)   Utility runway visual approach surface. The inner edge of this
approach surface coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The approach surface expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250
feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (2)   Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach surface. The inner
edge of this approach surface coincides with the width of the primary surface
and is 500 feet wide. The approach surface expands outward uniformly to a width
of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

§ 153.103 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land within any surface established by this chapter in such a manner as to
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of the pilots
using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create
bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the
landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.

§ 153.104 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any
change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this chapter and is diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport to indicate to
the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the airport.

§ 153.105 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses.
      (1)   Except as specifically provided herein, no material change shall be
made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise
established, and no tree shall be planted in any surface created unless a
permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for
a permit shall include evidence that a Determination of No hazard to Air
Navigation has been issued by the FAA per Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)
Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace (and all amendments, revisions,
or superseding laws) for the structure or demonstrate that notice to the FAA
was not required. Each application shall also include evidence that a permit
for the structure has been issued from the Indiana Department of Transportation
per I.C. 8-21-10, Regulation of Tall Structures (and all amendments, revisions,
or superseding laws) or demonstrate that a permit from the Indiana Department
of Transportation was not required. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for
a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless
a variance has been approved in accordance with §
153.105(D). In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal surface,
conical surface and transition surface no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such surfaces.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in §
153.102(B)(12)).
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or free to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Commission
determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more
than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with
the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the Board of Zoning
Appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal, application
or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and
relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Marion Board of
Aviation Commissioners for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the Marion Board of Aviation Commissioners does not respond to the
application within 21 days after receipt, the Board of Zoning Appeals may act
on its own to grant or deny said application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Board of Zoning Appeals, this condition may be modified to
require the owner to permit the airport at its own expense to install, operate,
and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

§ 153.106 ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to administer and enforce the
regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be
made to the Commission upon a form published for that purpose. Applications
required by this chapter to be submitted to the Commission shall be promptly
considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be forthwith transmitted by the Commission.

§ 153.121 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   (1)   The special exceptions listed in the districts as provided in
this chapter and their accessory buildings and uses may be permitted by the
Board in the districts indicated, in accordance with the procedure set forth in
this section.
      (2)   The special exceptions listed are those customarily located in the
community. When an appeal is taken to the Board upon the denial of an
application for an improvement location permit for a use not specifically
stated or implied elsewhere in these regulations and not listed, the Board
shall refer the matter of this proposed use to the Commission for consideration
of an amendment to the regulations.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit for
a special exception by the Zoning Administrator, it shall be referred to the
Commission for investigation as to the manner in which the proposed location
and character of the special exception will affect the Comprehensive Plan. The
Commission shall report the results of its study to the Board within. The Board
shall then proceed with a hearing on the application in the manner prescribed
in the ordinance adopting these regulations. Following the hearing and upon an
affirmative finding by the Board that:
      (1)   The proposed special exception is to be located in a district
wherein such use may be permitted; and
      (2)   The requirements set forth in the district and this section for
such special exception will be met; and
      (3)   The special exception is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of these regulations, will not substantially and permanently injure the
appropriate use of neighboring property and will serve the public convenience
and welfare, the Board shall order the Zoning Administrator to issue an
improvement location permit for the special exception.
   (C)   Commitments regarding a special exception use may be required or
accepted by the Board in the manner provided in
§ 153.180.
   (D)   An existing use which is listed herein as a special exception, and
which is located in a district in which such special exception may be
permitted, is a conforming use. Any expansion of such special exception
involving the enlargement of the buildings, structures and land area devoted to
such use shall be subject to the procedures described in this section.
(1985 Code, § 36-7-4-600(6.0))
§ 153.122 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   An improvement location permit for a special exception may not be
issued until the application has been approved by the Board and the Zoning
Administrator has been notified by the Board of the approval.
   (B)   Special exceptions may be revoked as follows.
      (1)   If a person to whom an improvement location permit has been issued
for a shopping center or a planned development fails to begin construction
within 24 months after the permit is issued, fails to complete 30% of the total
plan within 36 months after the permit is issued or within 12 months after
construction was begun (whichever period expires later), or fails to comply
with the approved plan, he may be required upon written request of any
interested person to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. However,
an order to show cause may not be issued for failure to begin construction on
time if in the meantime construction has begun.
      (2)   If a person to whom an improvement location permit has been issued
subject to this chapter fails to comply with the provisions and conditions of
the special exception as granted by the Board within 24 months from the date of
approval of the special exception, or other period as specified by the Board as
a condition of approval of the special exception, he may be required upon
written request of any interested person to show cause why the permit should
not be revoked. However, an order to show cause may not be issued for failure
to comply with such provisions if in the meantime construction has begun. If
construction has begun, the Board may direct the Zoning Administrator to
proceed with enforcement procedures as outlined in this chapter.
      (3)   In a proceeding to show cause under subsections (1) or (2), the
Board shall hold a public hearing, of which written notification shall be
published according to law and sent by registered mail to the holder of the
permit. This notice must be published and mailed at least ten days before the
date set for the hearing.
      (4)   At the hearing, evidence may be presented by any person present. If
on the evidence the Board finds that the holder of the permit has filed as
described in subsection (1), it shall revoke the permit. However, if it
considers the failure correctable within six months, it may defer revocation
and continue the hearing until a specified day within that period.
   (C)   Upon application by the holder of any improvement location permit for
a shopping center or planned development, the Board may change the plan on
which the permit is based. The Board shall handle the application as if it were
an original application for an improvement location permit for a special
exception. If it approves the application, the Board shall notify the Zoning
Administrator who shall issue an amended permit reflecting the approved change.
