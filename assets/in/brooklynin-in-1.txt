authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date of that ordinance or
subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.

attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express that intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word
or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest

   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
that section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, to the

contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

   (A)   Introduction and purpose.
      (1)   It is the policy of the town to provide a safe working environment
for all town employees. The use of alcoholic beverages or any other drug is
highly detrimental to the safety and productivity of employees in the
workplace. Being under the influence of any drug or alcoholic beverage while in
the workplace, while on duty, or while operating a vehicle or equipment owned
or leased by the town may be detrimental to the health and safety of all
employees. All employees of the town shall obey the laws and ordinances of the
United States, State of Indiana, Morgan County, and the town.
      (2)   The purposes of the Drug-Free Workplace Policy of the town
includes:
         (a)   Establishing and maintaining a safe working environment for all
town employees and maintaining a Drug-Free Workplace Policy in compliance with
the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 702 et seq.) and the State of
Indiana Drug-Free Workplace Executive Order 90-5 of 1990;
         (b)   Ensuring the reputation of the town within the broader
community;
         (c)   Reducing the number of accidental injuries to persons or
property; and
         (d)   Reducing absenteeism and tardiness; improving productivity; and
minimizing civil and criminal liability.

helpful.
      (2)   The Town Council shall have the responsibility and sole discretion
of enforcing the Drug Free Workplace Policy.

alcohol or other drug abuse with treatment, counseling, or other remedial
actions.
   (D)   Informing employees.
      (1)   Each employee shall be informed of the dangers of drug abuse in the

reinstated for employment after a layoff or leave of absence may be required to
submit to a drug screen test.
      (2)   Town employees and job applicants may be requested to provide
bodily substance samples (such as blood, breath, urine, hair, or other bodily
substances) to determine the prohibited use of alcohol or other drugs. Results
of any drug testing shall remain in the employee's confidential medical file.
      (3)   An employee will only be requested to submit to an alcohol or drug
test when the Town Council President, a person designated to act in his
absence, or a department head has reasonable suspicion that the employee has
used alcohol or other drugs or is impaired from the use of alcohol or other
drugs during employment hours with the town. In the event an employee is
requested to submit to an alcohol or drug test the Town Council President, a
person designated to act in his absence or a department head shall complete a

         (b)   Observation of alcohol or other drugs or containers
traditionally used for alcohol or other drugs;

         (e)   Information provided by reliable or credible sources of any of
the above.

         (a)   The death or injury of a town employee or a member of the
general public; or
         (b)   Damage to public or private property and/or equipment to the
extent that the equipment or vehicle must be towed from the accident scene. The
town reserves the right to order post-accident tests as it deems appropriate
based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the accident. Post-
accident tests may include screens for both alcohol and other drugs.
      (5)   Post-shooting testing shall be required when a police officer in a
line-of-duty incident shooting causes death or serious bodily injury to an
officer of other person. Post-shooting tests shall include screens for both
alcohol and other drugs.
      (6)   Any town employee who is convicted of a drug-related crime which is
a felony or misdemeanor under Indiana law or the law of the United States
arising out of conduct while on official town business or when serving as a
representative of the town shall notify the Clerk-Treasurer and the Town
Council President of the conviction in writing within 5 days of the conviction

beverage or any other drug during his or her working hours.

in his or her absence, the Vice-President) shall determine the immediate action
to be taken after consulting with the Clerk-Treasurer. Immediate action may
include retesting at the request of the employee, suspension, a request to
provide further information, the calling of an executive session or any other
reasonable action deemed appropriate for maintaining a drug free workplace.
      (4)   If any immediate action is taken by the Town Council President (or,
in his or her absence, the Vice-President), copies of the form provided to him

alcoholic beverage with an alcohol concentration equivalent of at least .04
gram of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the persons blood or 210 liters of the
persons breath) shall be "prima facie evidence" of a violation of the policy
subject to rebuttable evidence which the town employee has the burden of
presenting and proving. Rebuttable evidence may include a valid prescription
prescribed before the test for the drug which is the basis for the violation of
the policy.
   (H)   Penalties and consequences.
      (1)   If an applicant who is conditionally considered for employment or a

employment will also be denied.
      (2)   Enforcement of this policy may include discharge, suspension (with
or without pay) for up to 30 days, denial of employment, assisting employees

      (4)   Any employee who tests positive for alcohol or any drug on any drug
screen initiated for cause by the town or its grant-related contractors shall
be suspended without pay or removed from any grant-related employment for a
period of 30 days. If, at the end of 30 days, the employee can demonstrate
successful participation, at his or her own expense, in a drug abuse assistance
or rehabilitation program approved by the town, as evidenced by a clean drug
screen and an appropriate statement from the service provider, he or she may be
reinstated for employment with the town or its grant-related contractor.
      (5)   Any employee who refuses to take a drug test when requested to do
so shall be terminated.

the full Council by making a request, in writing, within 10 days after the date

in its discretion, or resolve the matter without a hearing.
      (2)   Any action taken by the full Council under this section may be

results from the action taken. The request shall be specific and filed with the
Clerk-Treasurer within 10 days of the action taken by the Council.
      (3)   The employee shall have the burden of proving any allegations of
his or her appeal brought under this section by a "preponderance of the
evidence" standard. However, the ruling on the request shall remain in the sole
discretion of the Town Council.

      (3)   The Town Superintendent of Utilities; and
      (4)   Other Town employees which may be designated by the Town Council,
from time to time, in writing.
   (B)   Designated town purchasing agents may purchase supplies and services
for the town as authorized and in compliance with the Small Purchases Policy as
set forth in this section.
   (C)   Policy.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following

different meaning.
         SMALL PURCHASE. A purchase of supplies and/or services in an amount
less than $50,000.
         SUPPLIES. Any property, including equipment, goods, and materials.
      (2)   For all small purchases of supplies, the following shall apply.
         (a)   Pricing.
            1.   A purchasing agent shall solicit and compare prices from as
many responsible suppliers of supplies as is practical. Responsible supplier
shall mean a supplier who has the apparent ability to timely and responsibly
deliver the described supplies and who submits a bid or quote conforming in all
material respects to the requisite description or specifications. In the event
there are three or more available suppliers who are believed to be responsible,
a purchasing agent shall solicit and attempt to secure no less than three
proposals.
            2.   For all purchases up to $5,000, a purchasing agent, after
complying with these policies, may commit to make the purchase.
            3.   For all purchases in excess of $5,000, a purchasing agent
shall comply with these policies, but shall have no authority to accept a quote
or proposal or otherwise commit the town to the purchase. Formal action by the
Council is required for all purchases of supplies over $5,000. A purchasing
agent shall purchase from the responsible supplier who submits the lowest
responsive bid unless there is a compelling reason to purchase from another,
taking into consideration any applicable preferences, past experience,
timeliness of delivery, reputation, and standing in the industry or profession.
            4.    Comparison pricing can be obtained via telephone, letter,
email, fax, or website.
         (b)   Purchasing preferences.
            1.   For purchases of supplies, the following purchasing
preferences may be applied to responsible providers who offer a responsive
quote:
               A.    Under I.C. 5-22-15-16, a price preference of 10% is
available to suppliers offering supplies that contain recycled materials or
post-consumer materials;
               B.   For purchases resulting in a contract, a price preference
of 5% is available to suppliers that qualify as a "local Indiana business" as
defined in I.C. 5-22-15-20.9; or
               C.   A price preference of 15% is available to suppliers that
qualify as an "Indiana small business" pursuant to I.C. 5-22-15-23.
            2.   In assessing whether a bid or quote is responsive, the
purchasing agent and/or purchasing agency may evaluate whether the supplies and
delivery schedule offered conform in all material respects to the
specifications and whether the supplier has complied with all applicable
statutes, ordinances, resolutions, or rules pertaining to the award of a public
contract.
            3.   A supplier who wants to claim a preference provided by this
policy must indicate in the quote which preference is claimed and the supplier
must certify that it qualifies for the stated preference. In order to be
considered for the Indiana small business preference, suppliers must provide
the purchasing agent with information regarding the number of employees
employed by the supplier and the average sales and receipts for the prior year.
            4.   The purchasing agent will use the U.S. Small Business
Administration Table of Small Business Size Standards in assessing whether a
particular supplier qualifies as a small business.
            5.   Suppliers are only eligible to claim one type of preference.
The purchasing agent shall follow the procedures outlined in I.C. 5-22-15-10 in
assessing purchasing preferences.
         (c)   Preference for supplies manufactured in the United States. As
required by I.C. 5-22-15-21, supplies manufactured in the United States shall
be specified and purchased by the town unless the purchasing agent determines
that any of the following apply:
            1.   The supplies are not manufactured in the United States in
reasonably available quantities;
            2.   The price of the supplies manufactured in the United States
exceeds by an unreasonable amount the price of available and comparable
supplies manufactured outside the United States. For purposes of this section,
UNREASONABLE AMOUNT shall mean 15%. Accordingly, if the price of supplies
manufactured in the United States exceeds, by 15% or more, the price of
available and comparable supplies manufactured outside the United States, the
difference in price shall be deemed to be unreasonable and the purchasing agent
may specify and/or purchase the supplies manufactured outside the United
States;
            3.   The quality of the supplies is substantially less than the
quality of comparably priced available supplies manufactured outside the United
States; or
            4.   The purchase of supplies manufactured in the United States is
not in the public interest.
         (d)   Purchases will not be artificially divided so as to constitute a
small purchase.
      (3)   Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as precluding the
purchasing agent from making a special purchase under I.C. 5-22-10.
      (4)   All purchases must be documented by a purchase order, invoice, or
receipt in a form and manner acceptable to the purchasing agency and the Clerk-
Treasurer.

GENERAL
§ 50.01 UTILITY CLERK.
   (A)   The Utility Clerk works under and is responsible to the Clerk-
Treasurer of the town. The Utility Clerk shall have the authority and
responsibility to collect monies from sewage and utility users, and to deposit
and account for the funds to the Clerk-Treasurer of the town.
   (B)   (1)   Services are billed on a calendar month basis. All bills are due
monthly. Bills are due on the fifteenth of each month. Any bill not paid on or
after the sixteenth of the month will include a delinquency charge as set out
in § 50.22 below.
      (2)   (a)   Any bill for utility service, not paid by the fifteenth of
the month is subject to being sent a disconnect/delinquent notice on the next
business day following the fifteenth day of the month. The disconnect notice
shall advise the utility customer that the utility service is subject to being
disconnected at any point following the last day the month. In order to avoid a
disconnection subsequent to a notice of disconnection, the bill must have a
zero ($0) balance as of the last day of the month. The delinquency requirements
for Sewer service disconnection are set out in §
51.35(D).
         (b)   The notice set out in division (B)(2) (a) of this section shall
contain the following information on the right to appeal in addition to any
other information on the notice. “You have a right to appeal this disconnection
by delivering a notice of the appeal in writing to (insert name) the Clerk
Treasurer no later than the 22nd day of the month at the Town Hall. Questions
may be answered by calling 317-831-3343.”
         (c)   Within two business days of receipt of a written appeal the
Clerk Treasurer shall review the account and determine if there is any reason
not to proceed with the disconnection. The Clerk Treasurer may make appropriate
corrections to the account and the notice of disconnection, if appropriate, or
may affirm the account and disconnection.
         (d)   The appellant shall be promptly notified in writing by the Clerk
Treasurer of his/her determination of the appeal. In the event that the
determination of the Clerk Treasurer is anything other than a complete
withdrawal of the disconnection determination, the appellant and the President
of the Town council shall be advised of the ruling. Further the appellant will
be advised of his/her right to appeal the Clerk Treasurer’s decision to the
Town Council. The following language is to be included with any adverse
determination by the Clerk Treasurer “You have a right to appeal this
determination by the Clerk Treasurer to the Brooklyn Town Council. Any appeal
must be made in writing within five days of the determination of the Clerk
Treasurer being challenged. The disconnection will still occur following the
ruling of the Clerk Treasurer, unless by written application to the President
of the Town Council he/she for good cause shown delays the disconnection. Any
appeal will be heard at the next scheduled Town Council Meeting. You may appeal
any adverse determination by the Town Council to the Morgan County Circuit
Court.”
      (3)   Any account upon which a dishonored check has been received is
considered to be unpaid unless and until the dishonored check and all charges
associated therewith have been fully paid.
   (C)   The Utility Clerk shall do the following if a bad check (no account,
insufficient funds and the like) is received:
      (1)   Send a certified mail notice, return receipt requested, to the
person or entity writing the check that the check was returned; that a fee of
$35 plus the cost of the certified mail notice, if a notice is used, must be
paid in addition to the amount of the check; that the check and the fee must be
paid within 15 days or the matter will be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney
of the county for collection;
      (2)   If unpaid by the date included in the notice, refer the matter to
the office of the Prosecuting Attorney of the county; or
      (3)   Treat the matter as a delinquent account within the time periods of
such matters.
   (D)   Compliance with this section shall be monitored by the filing of a
monthly report with the Town Council by the Clerk-Treasurer, to be reviewed at
the regular monthly meeting of the Town Council.
   (E)   Effective date of this section is December 13, 2001.

§ 50.02 CLARIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO GENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPALS RELATING TO
UTILITY EASEMENTS GENERALLY.
   (A)   The specifics in this subsection are clarifications of the law
relating to easements for the benefit of property owners and occupiers in the
Town of Brooklyn. This is intended to clarify but in no way is this intended to
reduce the scope of the law relating to easements owned by the town generally.
   (B)   No one is permitted to construct or place anything on or within an
easement that adversely affects the utility’s use of the easement. This
includes, without limitation, and object, structure or vegetation.
   (C)   In the event that the Town of Brooklyn determines that there is any
object, structure or vegetation that impedes the utilization of the easement,
that object, structure or vegetation may be removed by the town without any
notice or obligation to repair or replace the offending object, structure or
vegetation.
   (D)   To the extent that vegetation is necessary to avoid erosion or
degradation of any easement, no one is permitted to remove, eradicate or
interfere with the growth of such vegetation to the extent that such vegetation
is necessary to avoid erosion or degradation of the easement.
   (E)   Nothing in this subsection may be interpreted to allow the growth of
vegetation above and beyond the limits set by any weed control ordinance in the
Town Code or in any county ordinance that is applicable to the situation.
   (F)   Any one violating this section may be punished consistent with the
punishment sections for a Class violation as set out in §

questionable safety, or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow
from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure
differential between the two systems.

necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee or occupants of the property or premises where a violation is
found or suspected to exist. Water service to the property shall not be
restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   If the Town Water Department deems that a cross connection or an
emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Town Clerk and

backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water consumer to
install an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his or her
own expense, install the approved device at a location and in a manner approved

(Ord. passed 11-3-1975)
§ 51.31 SEWER CHARGES BASED ON WATER USAGE.
   (A)   Water obtained from the town's water utility. The sewer charges made
for sewerage service rendered to each lot, parcel of real estate or building
having any connection with the town's sewerage system or otherwise discharging
sewage into that system, either directly or indirectly, shall be based upon the
quantity of water presumed to enter the public sewers after being used in or on
the property, as the quantity is measured by the water meter or meters therein
used by the town's water utility, except as herein otherwise provided.
   (B)   Water obtained from other sources. Where the property obtains any part
or all of the water used from sources other than the town's water utility, the
owner or the tenant may be required by the town to install and maintain at his
own expense a meter or meters acceptable to the town for the purpose of
measuring the quantity of water obtained from these other sources, or the town
may deter mine the quantity of such water by whatever means and methods it may
find practicable.
   (C)   Exempt water - general. Where a significant portion of the metered
water does not and cannot enter the sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, and where the quantity of water entering the premises averages more
than 20,000 gallons per month, the person having charge of the property may
request permission from the town to install at his own expense either an
approved meter or meters to determine the quantity of water that cannot enter
the sewerage system or an approved sewage-measuring device or devices to
determine the volume of sewage that actually enters the sewerage system; when
appropriate, the town reserves the right to determine by whatever other means
and methods it may find practicable the percentage of the property's metered
water that enters the sewerage system. In any case the user charge shall be
applied to the quantity of water that can or actually does enter the public
sewers.
   (D)   Metering of sewage. The town may require a user to install and
maintain at his own expense an approved device to measure directly the volumes
of wastes discharged to the sewerage system if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered-water consumption records. Any non-residential
user whose monthly water consumption is 2,000 gallons or more shall install a
meter. The town shall inspect and approve such installations and no such
service, once installed, shall be removed without the town's approval.
(Ord. passed 11-3-1975)
§ 51.32 RESERVED.
§ 51.33 STRENGTH-OF-WASTES SURCHARGE.
   (A)   Liability for surcharge. Each industrial or non-industrial user who
discharges wastes into the sewerage system shall be subject to a surcharge, in
addition to the regular sewer charges, based on both the biochemical oxygen
demand (or on the chemical oxygen demand where BOD cannot be determined), and
the suspended solids content of the wastes, if these wastes have a
concentration greater than the following:
      (1)   A biochemical oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter; or where
BOD cannot be determined then, in lieu of BOD, a chemical oxygen demand of 400
milligrams per liter.
      (2)   A suspended solids content of 250 milligrams per liter.
   (B)   Computation of surcharge.
      (1)   The surcharge shall be determined as follows.
      (2)   The excess pounds of BOD (or COD) and of suspended solids will each
be computed by first multiplying the user's billing sewage volume measured in
units of 100 cubic feet for the current billing period by the factor 0.0062321
and then multiplying this product by the difference between:
         (a)   The concentrations measured in milligrams per liter of the BOD
(or COD) and of the suspended solids respectively in the user's sewage; and
         (b)   The allowed concentrations set out in division (A) above. The
surcharge for each constituent will then be determined by multiplying the
excess pounds of each constituent by the appropriate rate of surcharge set out
in division (C) below.
   (C)   Rates of surcharge. The rate of surcharge for each of the
aforementioned constituents shall be as follows:
      (1)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 8.7 cents per pound;
      (2)   For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where BOD cannot be determined,
8.7 cents per pound; and
      (3)   For suspended solids, 8.7 cents per pound.
   (D)   Revision of rates of surcharge. Prior to May 1 of each year, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall submit to the Board of Trustees a comparison of the
calculated unit costs for removing BOD and suspended solids from the Wastewater
Treatment Plant influent during the previous calendar year with the unit
charges currently in effect in order that the Board may determine whether the
current rates of surcharge are adequate or should be changed by the Board of
Trustees.
(Ord. passed 11-3-1975)
§ 51.34 BILLING OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Billing period. Sewer charges for sewerage service shall be prepared
and billed by the town along with the bills for water service and shall be
payable at the same time as the water bills.
   (B)   Liability for payment. The sewer charges for sewerage service shall be
billed to the person being billed for water service unless, by contract with
the utility, another person assumes such responsibility.
    (C)   First billings. The sewer charges and surcharges fixed in this
subchapter shall be extended to and cover any additional premises hereafter
served without the need for any hearing or notice. If the first billing to a
new customer covers a period other than a full billing month, then the sewer
charges for such billing shall be made in keeping with standard practice in the
water utility. Subsequent sewerage service billings shall be for periods
coinciding with the billing periods for water service. If such sewer charges
and/or surcharges are changed, the first billing after such change may also be
for a period other than a full billing month in order to keep the sewerage
billing periods coincident with the water billing periods.
(Ord. passed 11-3-1975; Am. Ord. 2020-2, passed 7-14-2020)
§ 51.35 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   How delinquencies arise. Charges for sewerage service levied pursuant
to this chapter shall be due and payable on or before the due dates shown on
the bills. Any service charge not paid by the due date (approximately 15 days
after the bill is rendered) shall be considered delinquent. Such delinquent
charge together with any applied penalty shall be collectible as hereinafter
set forth.
   (B)   Collection through the tax duplicate. As provided by the statutes of
the State of Indiana, delinquent sewerage service charges may be made a lien
against the property served through certification to the Auditor and to the
Recorder of the county. In such case, the delinquent service charges, together
with the mandatory penalty of 10%, shall be placed on the tax duplicate and be
collected in the same manner as regular taxes and assessments are collected.
   (C)   Collection through court actions. In addition to the foregoing
remedies, the town shall have the right to bring a civil action to recover any
delinquent charges together with a penalty of 10% and a reasonable attorney's
fee. It shall also have the right, as provided by the statutes of the State of
Indiana, to foreclose any lien established under the provisions of §
51.35(B), with recovery of the charge, a penalty 10% and a reasonable
attorney's fee.
   (D)   (1)   Disconnection of sewer service In addition to the foregoing
remedies and any other option available to the town, the town shall have the
right to disconnect sewer service and cap or seal off any connection to a
municipal sewer line on a delinquent account under the following conditions:
         (a)   The sewer bill has remained unpaid for a total of 12 months; and
         (b)   No payment arrangement has been made between the town and the
account or property owner; and
         (c)   In the event that a payment arrangement has been made between
the town and the account or property owner, disconnection will not be done for
so long as the payment arrangement is strictly followed.
      (2)   In order to resume service following a disconnection under the
provisions of this ordinance, full connection fees plus any required deposit
will be required.

§ 51.52 ADMISSIBLE INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Prior approval for certain wastes. Review and acceptance by the
Superintendent shall be obtained prior to the discharge into the public sewers
by any person of sewage whose wastes have:
      (1)   A BOD greater than 200 milligrams per liter;
      (2)   A suspended solids content greater than 250 milligrams per liter;
and/or
      (3)   Other contaminants or characteristics which, from their nature or
quantity, might be harmful to the structures, processes or operations of the
sewage works or to health, whether by themselves or through interacting with
other wastes in the public sewers.
   (B)   Pretreatment facilities. When, after making such a review, the
Superintendent concludes that, before the person discharges his wastes into the
public sewers, he must modify or eliminate those constituents which would be
harmful to the structures, processes or operations of the sewage works or
injurious to health, then the person shall either modify his wastes at the
point of origin or shall provide and operate at his own expense such
preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined to be
necessary to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the public sewers.
   (C)    Prior approval of pretreatment facilities. Plans, specifications and
other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or
processing facilities shall be submitted to the town for examination and
approval and no construction of such facilities shall begin until the town,
through its Board of Trustees, has given its written approval. Such approval
shall not exempt the person from the obligation to make further reasonable
adaptations of such facilities when such adaptations prove necessary to secure
the results desired. Plans, specifications and other pertinent information
shall also be submitted to the Stream Pollution Control Board for approval in
accordance with Stream Pollution Control Board Resolution No. 15.
   (D)   Operation of pretreatment facilities. When such preliminary treatment
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operating condition by the person at his own expense and shall be
subject to periodic inspection by the town. The person shall maintain suitable
operating records and shall submit to the Superintendent such monthly summary
reports of the character of the influent and effluent as the latter may
prescribe.
   (E)   Grease and sand traps. Whenever the Board of Trustees determines that
interceptors or traps are needed to protect the sewerage system or the
operations of the wastewater treatment plant from grease, oil, sand or similar
substances occurring in a customer's sewage, then such traps shall be installed
by the customer on his own lines at his own expense and shall be so maintained
by him that none of such substances can be carried over into the public sewers.
All traps shall be subject to the town's approval as to construction, location
and installation.
(Ord. 11-3-75, passed 11-3-1975)
§ 51.53 CONTROL OF ADMISSIBLE INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)    Submission of data on industrial wastes. Any person who discharges
industrial wastes into the town's sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, shall, upon the written request of the Board of Trustees, fill out
and file with the town within 90 days an industrial waste questionnaire to be
furnished by the town, in which he shall set out the quantity and
characteristics of the wastes discharged into the town's sewerage system.
Similarly, any person desiring to establish a new connection to a public sewer
for the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall be required to fill out
and file such a questionnaire, which shall include actual or predicted data
relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes to be discharged.
When special circumstances such as the size or complexity of his sewage
disposal problem would make complying with the time schedule cited above an
unreasonable burden on the person, an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days,
may be granted by the Board of Trustees upon presentation of a proper
application.
   (B)   Control manholes. Any person discharging industrial wastes into a
public sewer, either directly or indirectly, may be required by the Board of
Trustees, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent, to construct and
maintain at his own expense 1 or more control manholes at a specified location
or locations to facilitate the observation, measurement and sampling of his
wastes. Such manholes shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and
specifications of the town. The Board may also require the person to install
and maintain in any such manhole at said person's expense an approved volume-
measuring device. Plans for the installation of control manholes and related
equipment must be approved by the Board of Trustees, upon the recommendation of
the Superintendent or the Sewer Engineer, before construction is begun.
   (C)   Waste sampling.
      (1)   Any industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection and determination of character and
concentration. The examination shall be made as often as the Superintendent
deems it necessary (but at least once a year) and may include the use of
suitable continuously monitoring instruments in appropriate cases. Samples
shall be collected either manually or by overall composition of the wastes.
Sampling period shall be for a period of 7 consecutive days, but may be of
longer duration at the discretion of the town. In periods when the sampling
program extends for a greater number of consecutive days than 7, the town shall
have the prerogative of selecting the 7 consecutive days of its choice. Every
care shall be exercised in collecting the samples to ensure their preservation,
until analyzed, in a state comparable to that at the time the samples were
collected.
      (2)   The installation, operation and maintenance of the sampling
facilities shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the wastes and
shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees. Access to sampling
facilities shall be granted at all times to the Superintendent or his duly
authorized representative.
   (D)   Waste analyses. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in Standard Methods. However,
alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used
subject to mutual agreement between the Superintendent and the customer. The
town shall make, without charge to the customer, the initial analysis and
regular periodic check analyses of the customer's wastes as well as other tests
the Superintendent may deem advisable. Analyses made by the town at the request
of the customer shall be charged to the customer according to the standard work
order billing practices. All such analyses shall be binding in determining
strength-of-wastes surcharges and other matters dependent upon the character
and concentration of wastes.
   (E)   Use of representative analyses. Until an adequate analysis of a
representative sample of customer's wastes has been obtained, the town shall,
for the purpose of this subchapter, make a determination of the character and
concentration of the customer's wastes by using data based on analyses of
similar processes or data for his type of business that are available from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or from industry-recognized authoritative
sources. This method, if selected by the town, shall continue at the town's
pleasure or until an adequate analysis has been made.
   (F)   All data collected pertaining to industrial wastes including records
kept by each industrial user shall be subject to audit and review by the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Superintendent or his representatives shall have no authority to inquire into
any processes including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper,
or other industries beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste
treatment.
   (B)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in division (A) above, the Superintendent or duly authorized employees of the
town shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by
the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the
town employees and the town shall indemnify the company against loss or damage
to its property by town employees and against liability claims and demands for
personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out
of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by
negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
   (C)   The Superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the town
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
private properties through which the town holds a duly negotiated easement for
the purposes of, but not limited to inspection, observation, measurement,

vegetation.
   (D)   To the extent that vegetation is necessary to avoid erosion or
degradation of any easement, no one is permitted to remove, eradicate or
interfere with the growth of such vegetation to the extent that such vegetation
is necessary to avoid erosion or degradation of the easement.

the connection of a renewable generating facility to the utility's system
without first executing an interconnection agreement with the utility. Any

defined herein, including, specifically, livestock.

      (1)   In addition to the requirements in division (D)(1) of this section,
the owner of a dangerous or vicious dog who maintains the dog out-of-doors
shall enclose the entire area where the dog is kept with a perimeter fence.
Within this perimeter fence, the vicious or dangerous animal must be humanely

      (2)   Whenever the dog is outside of its enclosure, as provided for in
this division, but on the owner’s property, it must be attended by the owner
and restrained by a secure collar and leash of sufficient strength to prevent
escape. The leash shall be no longer than 10 feet, and the animal must be kept
at least 15 feet within the perimeter boundaries of the property unless the
perimeter boundary is securely fenced.
      (3)   No vicious or dangerous dog shall be chained, tethered or otherwise
tied to any inanimate object such as a tree, post or building, outside of its
own enclosure as provided for in this division.
   (F)   The owner of any guard dog or watchdog must confine it within a

all directions.
      (5)   The dog must have easy and convenient access to adequate shelter 24
hours a day.
      (6)   The shelter or doghouse must be kept clean, sanitary and in good

and/or its owner cited for a violation of this chapter.

cat or other animal on the streets or public places of the town, or to allow

following remedies as they deem appropriate:
   (A)   Taking into custody and impounding any animal found to be kept in
violation of any provision applicable under this chapter;
   (B)   If the violation is a violation only of this chapter, and is not
concurrently a violation of a state statute, citing the owner of the animal for
a town ordinance violation;

   (A)   The town may impound cause to be impounded, either in town facilities
or the facilities of a cooperating state or county agency, an animal for a
period of time deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. If the
animal is a wild animal, of a species indigenous to Indiana, which no person
has a lawful right to possess, is deemed to pose no unusual threat to humans or
livestock, and is sufficiently mature to care for itself in the wild, the town
may, as permitted by applicable federal, state and county laws and regulations,
release the animal back into the wild.
   (B)   Upon the expiration of applicable time periods, the town, or a
cooperating agency, may humanely destroy or otherwise lawfully dispose of an
impounded animal. An impounded domestic animal shall be kept for at least 5
days. If the owner of an impounded domestic animal is known, the town shall, as
soon as is practicable, notify that owner of the animal’s impoundment.
   (C)   Unless a court, or a state or county officer having proper authority,
orders the continued detention of an animal, the owner of an impounded domestic
animal, other than an animal impounded for violation of I.C. 35-46-3, may
reclaim the animal, prior to its destruction or other disposition as set forth
herein, by paying to the town the following fees:
      (1)   A charge of $50 for initial capture of the animal; and
      (2)   A charge of $25 per day for boarding and feeding the animal.
   (D)   If the town delivers the animal to a cooperating agency, the above
charges shall nevertheless apply for the time that the animal is in the town’s
custody, and an additional fee of $50 for transporting the animal shall apply.
These charges and fees are in addition to any penalties or costs assessed under
this chapter. Any cooperating agency into whose custody an animal is delivered
may charge and collect its own fees from the person reclaiming the animal for
the period of time the animal was in its custody. An animal impounded by reason
of a suspected violation of I.C. 35-46-3 shall be deemed in protective custody
and may not be released to its owner, except as permitted by and in compliance
with the provisions of I.C. 35-46-3.
(Ord. 2019-3, passed 12-10-2019)
§ 90.12 AUTHORITY TO DESTROY VICIOUS ANIMALS.

§ 131.01 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits loitering if he or she loiters or prowls in a place,
at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be found to have committed an offense
under this section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding
sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person
was true and, if it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would
have dispelled the alarm.
   (B)   No person shall, after first being warned by a police officer, or
where a "no loitering" sign or signs have been posted, loiter, stand, sit, or
lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk, street, curb, cross-walk,
walkway area, mall or that portion of private property utilized for public use,
so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free passage of pedestrians or
vehicles thereon. No person shall block, obstruct, or prevent free access to
the entrance to any building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and

STREET STANDARDS
§ 152.50 GENERAL.
   No subdivision plat shall be approved by the Plan Commission unless it is in
conformity with the following standards and requirements, which shall be deemed
to be minimal standards, and whenever the applicable standards and requirements
of the town’s Zoning Ordinance or of any other governmental unit or agency
having jurisdiction thereof are higher or more restrictive, the intended
improvements shall conform to or exceed the higher or more restrictive
standards and regulations.
(Ord. 1999-2 § 4.1, passed 2-9-1999)
§ 152.51 STREET STANDARDS.
   All proposed primary and secondary plats submitted for Plan Commission
approval under the provisions of this chapter shall make provision for streets
in compliance with the standards set forth herein:
   (A)   Right-of-way widths. Street right-of-way (ROW) widths shall not be
less than those indicated in Appendix A to this chapter, Table 1, Street
(Public or Private) Standards.
   (B)   Street grades, maximum. The grades of all streets shall not exceed
those indicated in Appendix A, Table 1 except where unusual topographic
conditions justify, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, a modification of
these standards.
   (C)   Street grades, minimum.
      (1)   No street which is designed and constructed with curb and gutter
shall have a grade of less than 0.5%.
      (2)   However, streets designed and constructed with side ditches shall
not be subject to a minimum grade requirement, if:
         (a)   Side ditches are provided which maintain a minimum grade of
1.0%; or
         (b)   Side ditches are provided in combination with a subsurface drain
in the ditch line with the subsurface drain maintaining a 0.1% minimum slope.
   (D)   Centerline radius.  The centerline radius for all streets shall not be
less than those indicated on Appendix A, Table 1, except in cases of unusual
topographic conditions.
   (E)   Sight distances. 
      (1)   All changes in street grades shall be made with vertical curves
that provide minimum stopping sight distances of not less than those indicated
on Appendix A, Table 1, except in cases of unusual topographic conditions.
      (2)   Sight distance for vertical alignment shall be determined by
measuring from a point 3.5 feet above the roadway surface along a line of sight
to a point 6.0 inches above the roadway surface.
   (F)   Pavement width. The pavement width of all streets shall be adequate to
serve the existing and future estimated traffic load for the facility and shall
comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Lane widths for residential streets (public or private) shall be
those indicated in Appendix A, Table 3, Interior Local Street (Public or
Private) Standards; and
      (2)   Lane widths for business, industrial and manufacturing streets
(public or private) shall be those indicated in Appendix A, Table 1.
   (G)   Depth and materials.  Depth and materials of all streets shall comply
with the following standards:
      (1)   Residential streets (public or private) shall be those indicated in
Appendix A, Table 3; and
      (2)   Business, industrial and manufacturing streets (public or private)
shall be those indicated in Appendix A, Table 1.
   (H)   Culs-de-sac. A cul-de-sac shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length,
measured from the extended right-of-way line at the entrance to the center of
the turnaround, or serve more than 30 lots. Any cul-de- sac in excess of 150
feet shall be provided with a turnaround selected from Appendix B, Figure 1,
Permissible Turnaround Designs.
   (I)   Interior local streets. Interior local streets shall be required;
provided, however, the Plan Commission may accept half-width rights-of-way for
streets where the provision of the half-width right-of- way is essential to the
reasonable development of the proposed subdivision in conformity with the
requirements of this chapter; and the Plan Commission finds it will be
practical to obtain the dedication of the other half-width of the right-of-way
when the adjoining property is platted. Wherever an existing half-width right-
of-way for a street is platted adjacent to a tract proposed to be subdivided,
the remaining half-width of street right-of-way shall be platted within the
tract.
   (J)   Arrangement of streets.  The arrangement of streets shall be such as
to cause no hardship in the subdividing of adjacent properties. The Plan
Commission may require the dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the
development of adjoining properties or to facilitate the future improvement or
expansion of streets in accordance with the county highway functional
classification map. At the time that an official thoroughfare plan is adopted
for the county, the thoroughfare plan shall replace the county highway
functional classification map for the purpose of determining the dedication of
street rights-of-way or to facilitate the future improvement or expansion of
streets.
   (K)   Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be permitted only where a
future extension or connection is planned. If the dead-end street is 150 feet
or longer in length, a temporary right-of-way dedication and the construction
of a temporary turnaround facility shall be required.
   (L)   Intersections. No street intersecting with an arterial street or a
collector street shall vary from a 90-degree angle by more than 20 degrees.
   (M)   Offsets. Wherever practical, local street offsets should be minimized.
However, in those cases where offsets are required due to physical site
constraints or approved by the Plan Commission, the minimum distance of the
offset shall be 125 feet on centerlines.
   (N)   Clear sight areas.  
      (1)   No landscape plantings, shrubs, trees, fences, screening devices or
other objects shall be permitted to completely obstruct vision within a clear
sight area.
      (2)   A clear sight area shall be established between the heights of 2-1/
2 feet and 9 feet above the crown of the street or driveway in a triangular
area as descried below:
         (a)   Controlled access intersections.  A triangular area formed by
the intersection of 2 street right-of-way lines or street easements and a line
connecting points located 25 feet from the intersection of the street right-of-
way lines or street easements. In the case of a rounded or corner-cut right-of-
way, the 25-foot measurement shall be taken from the point of intersection of
the street right-of-way lines or street easements extended.
         (b)   Uncontrolled access intersections.  A triangular area formed by
the intersection of 2 street right-of-way lines, street easements or driveway
surfaces; and a line connecting a point located 8 feet from the intersection of
the street right-of-way lines, street easements or driveway surfaces; and a
point located 70 feet along the street right-of-way line or street easement. In
the case of a rounded or corner- cut right-of-way, the 8-foot measurement shall
be taken from the point of intersection of the street right- of-way lines or
street easements extended.
   (O)   Standards. Before any roadway can be considered for acceptance into
the town roadway system, the roadway must meet the current town standards as
set forth below in Appendix A, Tables 1 through 3, and Appendix B, Figures 1
and 2.
   (P)   Stabilization. All proposed street shall be lime stabilized prior to
finish material applied.

   (B)   Sidewalk system plan.
      (1)   A sidewalk system plan shall be prepared as part of the application
for primary and secondary plat approval which provides every lot within a
subdivision with reasonable access to sidewalks connecting with all of the
community facilities or commercial enterprises within or adjacent to the
subdivision, in a manner that will provide convenient pedestrian circulation
throughout the neighborhood or area in which the subdivision is located.
      (2)   The Plan Commission may require the construction of sidewalks to
connect with existing or future proposed sidewalks in areas adjacent to the
subdivision where the sidewalk system plan is approved by the Plan Commission.
   (C)   Specifications governing sidewalk construction. Any sidewalk shall:
      (1)   Be constructed of portland cement concrete unless otherwise

GENERAL
§ 155.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving
the town may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm water
runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or agricultural use to a more
urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment from
developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
   (B)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Drainage Board of the town
(the Board) that the storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall
be required of all new development, any redevelopment and other new
construction in the town. The release rate of storm water from developed lands
shall not exceed the release rate from the land area in its present land use,
unless approved by the Board.
   (C)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage
tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each
proposed project be discussed with the town at the earliest practical time in
the planning stage.
(Ord. 1995-10 § I, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.002 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed as additional requirements to
minimum standards required by other ordinances of the county. In the case of
conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1995-10 § II, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.003 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement
plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections, appeals, and
similar matters, and compliance with applicable state statutes and regulations
shall be required.
(Ord. 1995-10 § III, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.004 POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that with the possible exception of White Lick Creek,
the streams and drainage channels serving the town may not have sufficient
capacity to receive and convey storm water runoff resulting from continued
urbanization. Accordingly, the storage and controlled release rate of excess
storm water runoff shall be required for any development, redevelopment and new
construction located not outletting directly to White Lick Creek unless
downstream improvements are made according to §
155.071 within the town.
   (B)   The release rate of storm water from development, redevelopments and
new construction may not exceed the storm water runoff from the land area in
its present state of development. The developer must submit to the Board
detailed computations of runoff before and after development, redevelopment or
new construction which demonstrate that runoff will not be increased.
   (C)   These computations must show that the peak runoff rate after
development for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration must not
exceed the 10-year return period predevelopment peak runoff rate. The critical
duration storm is that storm duration that requires the greatest detention
storage.
   (D)   Computations for areas up to and including 200 acres may be based on
the rational method; typical runoff coefficients are listed herein. For areas
larger than 200 acres, hydrograph techniques and/or computer drainage modeling
methods may be used. Hydrograph techniques and computer modeling methods used
to determine storm water runoff shall be proven methods, subject to approval of
the Board.
(Ord. 1995-10 § V, passed 10-13-1995)

bridges, dams, levees, dikes, floodwalls, wharves, piers, dolphins, booms,
weirs, bulkheads, jetties, groins, excavations, fills or deposits of any kind,
utility lines, or any other building, structure or obstruction; also, any ditch
work (new construction, deepening or modification) within 1/2 mile of a public
freshwater lake of 10 acres or more in area.
   (B)   The approval of the Natural Resources Commission, in writing, must be
obtained before beginning construction. Applications for approval should be
submitted to:
Department of Natural Resources
Division of Water
Indianapolis, Indiana
   (C)   All applications should be made on the standard application form
provided by the Commission and should be accompanied by plans, profiles,
specifications and other data necessary for the Commission to determine the
effect of the proposed construction upon the floodway and on flood control in
the state.
   (D)   Application made to and approval granted by the Natural Resources
Commission does not in any way relieve the owner of the necessity of securing
easements or other property rights, and permits and/or approvals from affected
property owners and local, state and federal agencies.
   (E)   The engineering staff of the Division of Water is available to discuss
and offer suggestions regarding requirements in the design of structures in
floodways. High water marks have been set on many of the streams in the state,
and information is available from the Division of Water on actual and/or
potential flooding. Information regarding benchmarks set to Mean Sea Level
Datum, General Adjustment of 1929, is available from the Division of Water,
Surveying and Mapping Section.
   (F)   Applications are considered by the Commission at regular meetings

(Ord. 1995-10 § VII, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.017 DETERMINATION OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   (A)   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development.
   (B)   The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a given
rainfall intensity may be calculated as follows:
      (1)   For areas up to and including 200 acres, the rational method may be
used.
         (a)   In the rational method, the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic
feet per second is computed as:
         Q = CIA
where C=runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the drainage
area and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall; I=average intensity of
rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration
(tc) for a selected rainfall frequency; and A=tributary drainage area in acres.
         (b)   Guidance to selection of the runoff coefficient C is provided by
Appendix A, Tables 1 and 2 which show values for different types of surface and
local soil characteristics. The composite C-value used for a given drainage
area with various surface types shall be the weighted average value for the
total area calculated from a breakdown of individual areas having different
surface types.
         (c)   Appendix A, Table 3 provides runoff coefficients and inlet times
for different land use classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land
situated in an upstream area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for
this area in its present or existing state of development.
         (d)   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from data shown in
Appendix A, Table 6. The time of concentration (tc) to be used shall be the sum
of the inlet time and flow time in the drainage facility from the most remote
part of the drainage area to the point under consideration. The flow time in
the storm sewers may be estimated by the distance in feet divided by velocity
of flow in feet per second.
         (e)   The velocity shall be determined by the Manning equation.
         (f)   Inlet time is the combined time required for the runoff to reach
the inlet of the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time and flow time
through established surface drainage channels such as swales, ditches and sheet
flow across such areas as lawns, fields, and other graded surfaces. It may be
computed by using Appendix B, Figure 1.
      (2)   The runoff rate for areas in excess of 200 acres shall be
determined by methods described in §
155.076.
(Ord. 1995-10 § VIII, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.018 AMOUNT OF RUNOFF TO BE ACCOMMODATED BY VARIOUS PARTS OF DRAINAGE
FACILITY.
   (A)   The drainage facility shall be such that all habitable structures are
free from a 100-year flood. Also, all land alterations shall be accomplished so
as to prevent damage to adjoining property. Provision must be made for
receiving and conveying off-site runoff through the site and for preserving
existing drainage systems (including field tiles). A natural or surface channel
system shall be designed with adequate capacity to convey through the
development the storm water runoff from all tributary upstream areas. This
bypass channel shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a 100-
year storm, assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas
are fully developed.
   (B)   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows:
      (1)   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street
gutters, swales, sewers and small channels which collect storm water must
accommodate peak runoff from a 10-year return period storm. These minimum
requirements must be satisfied:
         (a)   The allowable spread of water on collector streets is limited to
maintaining 2 clear 10-foot moving lanes of traffic. One lane is to be
maintained on local roads, while places can have a water spread equal to 1/
2 their width. No reverse crown roadways will be constructed;
         (b)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic feet per
second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year return
period storm within the drainage easement;
         (c)   1.   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff from
a 50-year return period storm with less than 1 foot of backwater when crossing
under a road which is part of the Indiana Department of Transportation rural
functional classification system and is classified as a principal or minor
arterial or major or minor collector road.
            2.   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum diameter of 12 inches
and a minimum length of 20 feet.
      (2)   Major drainage systems are defined in §
155.005 and shall be designed in accordance with Indiana Department of Natural
Resources Standards as described in §
155.015.
(Ord. 1995-10 § IX, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.019 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   The Drainage Board may, as a prerequisite to issuance of a storm water
permit, require the dedication of easements to the town and to owners of other
affected lands by the owner of the parcel of land relative to which application
for a storm water permit has been made, where necessary to achieve satisfactory
present and future drainage of the parcel and the area surrounding the parcel.
   (B)   Provisions concerning these easements are as follows:
      (1)   Easements shall be required for areas that drain greater than 5
acres of storm water runoff which are adjacent to the parcel in question but
not under the same ownership.
      (2)   These easements shall be accessible to vehicular traffic.
      (3)   Easements along a public right-of-way shall be contiguous with and
accessible from the right-of-way. The granting of a drainage easement to the
town does not create a responsibility for the town to maintain the drainage
facilities located within the easement area.
      (4)   The town shall be under no obligation to accept a dedication from
the subdivider, developer or owner of any of the storm water detention
facilities, ponds or areas; but the town, in the exercise of its sole and
exclusive discretion, may require the subdivider, developer or owner to so
dedicate the facilities, ponds or areas to the town. In the event that no such
dedication is required, the subdivider, developer and/or owner shall be
required to submit to the town written evidence in the form of covenants,
conditions or restrictions that run with and become a charge against the land
providing for the perpetual maintenance of the storm water retention
facilities, ponds or areas at no cost to the town in form and content
acceptable to the town, which covenants, conditions and restrictions the town
is hereby authorized to record with the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds as
and for permanent evidence of that obligation to maintain.
      (5)   Detention/retention basins shall be constructed within a storm
water easement either platted or legally described and recorded as a perpetual
storm water easement, a minimum of 20 feet horizontally outside of the design
100-year floodwater elevation of the basin. All detention/retention basins
shall be maintained according to original design capacity.
      (6)   Guidelines for minimum easement widths for swales and ditches are
provided below. A hydraulic and hydrologic computation must be performed to
determine the inundated area of the 25-year storm. The easement must protect
the entire 25-year flood area. For drainage areas larger than 5 acres, an
analysis must be performed for the 100-year storm event. A 100-year storm event
flood line must be added to the 25-year easement restriction. The lowest
location of any adjacent structures where water may enter must be outside the
100-year storm event plan view.
         (a)   Residential collector swales.  
            1.   Surface water collector swales within the rear yard and side
yard areas of residential subdivisions shall be constructed within a drainage
easement possessing a minimum width of 20 feet, with the drainage swale
constructed approximately in the middle of the easement.
            2.   Surface water collector swales within commercial and
industrial developments will not be required to be constructed within a storm
water easement, provided only minimal quantities of off-site surface water
flows are required to enter the channel. Minimal quantities shall mean less
than 5 acres of land area. Collector swales within commercial and industrial
developments which collect 5 acres or more of off-site land area shall be
constructed within a storm water easement possessing a minimum width of 20
feet.
         (b)   Open ditches.  Existing open ditches which are to be perpetuated
through the developing property and newly constructed open ditches shall be
placed within a drainage easement of a minimum width of 20 feet from the tops
of banks of the channel. All ditches shall be maintained according to original
design capacity.
      (7)   (a)   Minimum easement widths for storm drains are as provided
below. More stringent requirements for storm water easement size and additional
covenants may be made by the Department based upon individual site conditions.
         (b)   Storm drain easement widths are as follows:
 
Depth of Drain, from Finish Diameter of Storm Drain Minimum Easement Width
Grade to Crown
3 feet or less              15 inches or less       15 feet
More than 3 feet            15 inches or less       20 feet
3 feet or less              Greater than 15 inches  20 feet
More than 3 feet            Greater than 15 inches  25 feet
 
      (8)   An easement for open culverts must be recorded for the 50-year
storm event flow areas.

STORM SEWER DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.030 GENERAL.
   All storm sewers, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public property, shall conform to the design standards and other
requirements contained herein.
(Ord. 1995-10 § X, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.031 MANNING’S EQUATION.
   The hydraulic capacity of storm sewers shall be determined using Manning’s
equation:
      V = 1.486 R2/3 S½
         n
   (A)   The variables of this equation are: V=Mean velocity of flow in feet
per second; R=the hydraulic radius in feet; S=the slope of the energy grade
line in feet per foot; and n=roughness coefficient.
   (B)   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross-sectional area of
flow divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted perimeter. Typical n-values
and maximum permissible velocities for storm sewer materials are listed in
Appendix A, Table 4. Roughness coefficient n-values for other sewer materials
can be found in standard hydraulics texts and references.
(Ord. 1995-10 § X A, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.032 MINIMUM SIZE.
   The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be 12 inches. Rate of release for

sewer is flowing full.
(Ord. 1995-10 § X C, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.034 ALIGNMENT.
   Storm sewers shall be straight between manholes insofar as possible. Where
long radius curves are necessary to conform to street layout, the minimum
radius of curvature shall be no less than 100 feet for sewers 42 inches and
larger in diameter. Deflection of pipe sections shall not exceed the maximum
deflection recommended by the pipe manufacturer. The deflection shall be
uniform and finished installation shall follow a smooth curve.
(Ord. 1995-10 § X D, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.035 MANHOLES.
   (A)   Manholes shall be installed to provide access to continuous
underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.
Manholes shall be provided at the following locations:
      (1)   Where 2 or more storm sewers converge;
      (2)   At the point of beginning or at the end of a curve, and at the

through grated openings and convey it to storm sewers, channels or culverts.
Inlet design and spacing shall be in accordance with § 7-400 of the Indiana
Department of Transportation’s Road Design Manual, Volume 1 or other approved
design procedure. The inlet grate opening provided must be adequate to pass the
design 10-year flow with 50% of the sag inlet areas clogged. An overload
channel from sag inlets to the overflow channel or basin shall be provided at
sag inlets, so that the maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the
street sag shall not exceed 7 inches.
(Ord. 1995-10 § X F, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.037 WORKMANSHIP AND MATERIALS; SPECIAL HYDRAULIC STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm sewers
shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition of the
Indiana Department of Transportation’s Standard Specifi- cations; additionally,
ductile iron pipe shall be laid in accordance with American Water Works
Association (AWWA) C-600 and clay pipe shall be laid in accordance with
American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) C-12.
   (B)   Materials.  
      (1)   Storm sewer manholes and inlets shall be constructed of masonry,
cast in place concrete or precast reinforced concrete. Material and
construction shall conform to Indiana Department of Transportation’s Standard
Specifications, § 720.
      (2)   Pipe and fittings used in storm sewer construction shall be ductile
iron pipe (AWWA C-151), double-walled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, or
concrete pipe (ASTM C-76). Backfill and bedding for HDPE pipe shall be No. 8
stone to within 6 inches of the ground surface where the pipe is within 5 feet
of a roadway. Under all roads and driveways, the No. 8 stone backfill will
extend to the road subgrade. Other pipe and fittings not specified herein may
be used only when specifically authorized by the Board. Pipe joints shall be
flexible and watertight and shall conform to the requirements of § 715.02,
Materials, of the latest edition of the Indiana Department of Transportation’s
Standard Specifications.
   (C)   Special hydraulic structures. Special hydraulic structures required to
control the flow of water in storm runoff drainage systems include junction
chambers, drop manholes, inverted siphons, stilling basins and other special
structures. The use of these structures shall be limited to those locations
justified by prudent planning and by careful and thorough hydraulic engineering
analysis.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XI, passed 10-13-1995)
OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.050 GENERAL.
   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other design
requirements contained herein.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XII, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.051 MANNING’S EQUATION.
   The waterway for channels shall be determined using Manning’s equation:
      Q=AV=A 1.486 R2/3 S½
            n
where A=Waterway area of channel in square feet; Q=Discharge in cubic feet per
second (cfs); and V, R, S and n are as explained in §
155.031.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XII A, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.052 CHANNEL CROSS-SECTION AND GRADE.
   The required channel cross-section and grade are determined by the design
capacity, the material in which the channel is to be constructed, and the
requirements for maintenance. A minimum depth may be required to provide
adequate outlets for subsurface drains, tributary ditches or streams. The
channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the channel is high enough to
prevent siltation but low enough to prevent erosion. Velocities less than 1.5
feet per second should be avoided because siltation will take place and
ultimately reduce the channel cross-section. The maximum permissible velocities
in vegetal-lined channels are shown in Appendix A, Table 5. Developments
through which the channel is to be constructed must be considered in design of
the channel section.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XII B, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.053 SIDE SLOPES.  
   Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than 3 to 1. Flatter slopes
may be required to prevent erosion and for ease of maintenance. Where channels
will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper than 1-1/2 to 1 with adequate
provisions made for weep holes. Side slopes steeper than 1-1/2 to 1 may be used
for lined channels, provided that the side lining and structural retaining wall
are designed and constructed with provisions for live and dead load surcharge.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XII C, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.054 CHANNEL STABILITY.
   (A)   Characteristics of a stable channel include:
      (1)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits;
      (2)   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the channel
cross-section is changed appreciably;
      (3)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop;
      (4)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere; and
      (5)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
   (B)   Channel stability shall be determined for an aged condition and the
velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full flow, whichever is
greater, using n-values for various channel linings as shown in Appendix A,
Table 4. In no case is it necessary to check channel stability for discharges
greater than that from a 100-year return period storm.
   (C)   Channel stability must be checked for conditions immediately after
construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall be calculated for
the expected flow from a 10-year return period storm on the watershed, or the
bank full flow, whichever is smaller. The n-value for newly constructed
channels in fine-grained soils and sands may be determined in accordance with
the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil Conservation Service
and shall not exceed 0.025. The allowable velocity in the newly constructed
channel may be increased by a maximum of 20% to reflect the effects of
vegetation to be established under the following conditions:
      (1)   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed are
suitable for rapid establishment and support of erosion-controlling vegetation;
      (2)   Species of erosion-controlling vegetation adapted to the area, and
proven methods of establishment are shown; and
      (3)   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment of
vegetation on the channel side slopes.

§ 155.056 ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW REGULATED DRAIN.
   When the Board determines it is necessary to establish a new regulated
drain, each developer must provide the necessary information and meet the
requirements of the 1965 Indiana Drainage Code, as amended, for the
establishment of a new regulated drain. The Board shall determine the necessary
easements for adequate maintenance of any new regulated drain. It is mandatory
that all storm drains and retention/detention basins in residential
subdivisions become regulated drains to assure proper maintenance of the
system.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XII F, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.057 APPURTENANT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   The design of channels will provide all structures required for the
proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto and travelways for
operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and structures needed for entry of
surface and subsurface flow into channels without significant erosion or
degradation shall be included in the design of channel improvements. The design
is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water level control devices, and
any other appurtenance affecting the functioning of the channels and the
attainment of the purpose for which they are built.
   (B)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts, bridges,
buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and subsurface
drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be evaluated
to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts and bridges
which are modified or added as part of channel improvement projects shall meet
reasonable standards for the type of structure, and shall have a minimum
capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency design
requirements, whichever is greater.

(Ord. 1995-10 § XIII, passed 10-13-1995)
STORM WATER DETENTION
§ 155.070 PURPOSE.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of storm water runoff.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.071 ACCEPTABLE DETENTION METHODS.
   (A)   The increased storm water runoff resulting from a proposed development
should be detained on-site by the provisions of appropriate wet or dry bottom
reservoirs, by storage on flat roofs, parking lots, streets, lawns or other
acceptable techniques. Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the
velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to control the runoff rate
partially. Detention basins shall be sized to store excess flows from storms
with a 100-year return period. Control devices shall limit the discharge to a
rate no greater than that prescribed by this chapter (see §§
155.075 and
155.076). When detention is required, all parts of the developing site should
drain through the detention/retention basin. Detention is not required for
offsite drainage. If the detention/retention basin intercepts off-site
drainage, the storage volume and the outlet size should be based on the entire
contributing watershed area.
   (B)   As an alternative, the developer may construct, at his or her sole
expense, improvements downstream which would make detention unnecessary.
Detailed plans and specifications for these alternative improvements must be
submitted along with all required engineering data prior to construction and
must be accepted by the engineer and approved by the Board prior to
construction. In addition, the developer must obtain and provide the town with
written evidence that he or she has obtained the approval of all property
owners on whose property any such downstream improvements are to be
constructed.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV A, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.072 DESIGN OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
   Design of storm water detention facilities shall be based on a return period
of once in 100 years. The storage volume and outflow rate shall be sufficient
to handle storm water runoff from a critical duration storm, as defined in §§
155.075 and
155.076. Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationships shall be those
given in Appendix A, Table 6.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV B, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.073 ALLOWABLE RELEASE RATE.
   (A)   The allowable release rate of storm water originating from a proposed
development shall not exceed the amount specified in §
155.004 and as in §§
155.075 and
155.076.
   (B)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system is
inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the allowable
release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the
receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system, and additional detention as
determined by the Board shall be required to store that portion of the runoff
exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.
   (C)   If more than 1 detention basin is involved in the development of the
area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from any
1 detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its drainage
area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the restriction.
The use of large regional detention basins is encouraged.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV C, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.074 DRAINAGE SYSTEM OVERFLOW DESIGN.
   Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to convey the storm water
runoff from all upstream tributary areas through the development under
consideration for a storm of 100-year design return period calculated on the
basis of the upstream land in its present state of development. An allowance,
equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, shall be made for upstream
detention when the upstream detention and release rate have previously been
approved by the Board and evidence of its construction can be shown.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV D, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.075 DETERMINATION OF STORAGE VOLUME; RATIONAL METHOD.
   (A)   For areas of 200 acres or less, the rational method may be used to
determine the required volume of storm water storage. The following 11-step
procedure may be used to determine the required volume of storage. Other design
methods may also be used, subject to approval of the Board, and as described in
§
155.076.
   (B)   The steps of the procedure follow, in order:
      (1)   Determine total drainage area in acres A.
      (2)   Determine composite runoff coefficient Cu based on existing land
use (undeveloped).
      (3)   Determine time of concentration tc in minutes based on existing
condition.
      (4)   Determine rainfall intensity Iu in inches per hour, based on time
of concentration and using data given in Appendix A, Table 6 for the 10-year
return period.
      (5)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped) and 10-year
return period:
         Qu=Cu IuA
      (6)   Determine composite runoff coefficient Cd based on developed
conditions and a 100-year return period.
      (7)   Determine the 100-year return period rainfall intensity Id for
various storm durations td up through the time of concentration for the
developed area using Appendix A, Table 6.
      (8)   Determine the developed inflow rates Qd for various storm durations
td, measured in hours:
         Qd=CdIdA
      (9)   Compute a storage rate Std for various storm duration td up through
the time of concentration of the developed area:
         Std=Od-Qu
      (10)   Compute required storage volume SR in acre-feet for each storm
duration td. This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (2*td) hours with
the peak flow of Std at td hours:
         SR=Std (td/12)
      (11)   Select the largest storage volume computed in step 10 for
detention basin design.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV E, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.076 DETERMINATION OF STORAGE VOLUME; OTHER METHODS.
   (A)   For areas greater than 200 acres, methods other than the rational
method for determining runoff and routing of storm water may be used to
determine the storage volume required to control storm water runoff. The
procedures or methods used must receive the prior approval of the Board. The
ILLUDAS and TR-20 models are approved by the Board for appropriate use in
analysis of the runoff and routing of storm water. The use of these models or
other approved procedures can be defined in a 7-step procedure to determine the
required storage volume of the detention basin.
   (B)   The steps of the procedure follow, in order:
      (1)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of storm water.
      (2)   For each storm duration listed in Table 6, perform steps (3)
through (6).
      (3)   Determine the 10-year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this flow by
Qu10.
      (4)   Determine the 100-year runoff hydrograph (Hd100) for developed
conditions.
      (5)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (Hs100) by subtracting
a flow up to Qu10 from the hydrograph (Hd100) found in step 4.
      (6)   Determine the volume of water (Vs) to be stored by calculating the
area under the hydrograph Hs100.
      (7)   The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(Vs) found for any storm duration analyzed in step 6.
(Ord. 1995-10 § XIV F, passed 10-13-1995)
§ 155.077 GENERAL DETENTION BASIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the storm water
runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this chapter. The
volume of storage provided in these basins, together with storage as may be
authorized in other on-site facilities shall be sufficient to control excess
runoff from the 100-year storm.
   (B)   The following design principles shall be observed:
      (1)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at the
design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 3 hours
unless additional storms occur within the period;
      (2)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored (without a
permanent pool) shall not exceed 4 feet;
      (3)   All storm water detention facilities shall be separated by not less
than 50 feet from any building or structure to be occupied and, unless
otherwise indicated by the Board, shall be entirely fenced;
      (4)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features, such as sliding hills, sports fields and
the like. Slopes no steeper than 4 horizontal to l vertical for safety, erosion

      (7)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply as
possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper
operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned downstream
channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum authorized
peak flow rate;
      (8)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall be
provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions, should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention;
      (9)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required;
      (10)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be
performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design; and
      (11)   (a)   A report shall be submitted to the Board describing the
following:
             1.   The proposed development;
             2.   The current land use conditions;
