accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   The repeal of an ordinance stating that the provisions of an act are
severable as provided in division (B) does not affect the operation of division
(B) with respect to that act.
(I.C. 1-1-1-8)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, such

amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.09 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any

or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.10 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
such error.
§ 10.11 OFFICIAL TIME.

by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event,
or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be
included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it

(Trial Rule 6(A))
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   This code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code.
§ 10.14 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and

   (B)   Enforcement Procedures.
      (1)   Any person who violates Title V, Title IX, Title XI or Title XV of
this code of ordinances, or any other ordinance of the city containing a
penalty for violation, other than Title VII shall be subject to the enforcement
provisions of this subsection.
      (2)   This subsection shall not include violations of Title VII or amend
the enforcement provisions of the Traffic Code contained therein.
      (3)   Any action to enforce an ordinance or code section listed in
division (B)(1) above, shall be initiated by filing a Complaint and Summons
(the Complaint) in the Noblesville City Court, on a form substantially similar
to Exhibit A attached to Ordinance 6- 3-02 and incorporated herein by
reference.
      (4)   The Complaint shall be signed by any sworn police officer, by any
Director of the city, or such employee of the Director's department as the
Director shall authorize in writing (the Enforcement Officers). Said
authorization shall be on a form substantially similar to Exhibit B attached to
Ordinance 6-3-02 and incorporated herein by reference, approved by the Board of
Public Works and Safety, and filed in the minutes of the Board of Public Works
and Safety.
      (5)   The Enforcement Officers, in their sole discretion, may issue
warning tickets which allow the person, or landowner, who is cited to remedy
the alleged ordinance violation within such time as is approved by the
enforcement officer, which time shall not exceed 30 days without good cause.
      (6)   If an alleged violation is not remedied within the time on a
warning, the Enforcement Officers may issue a new complaint.
      (7)   In the event the ordinance violation concerns the condition or
improvement of a parcel of real estate, the Enforcement Officers may, as
opposed to citing the person in possession of the real estate, issue the
Complaint to the owner of the real estate. The name and address of the
landowner shall be obtained from the property records maintained by the
Hamilton County Auditor. The Enforcement Officers shall attach a copy of the
property record information to the Complaint. Such Complaint, along with a copy
of the property record information shall constitute prima facie proof of the
ownership of the real estate where the violation occurred.
      (8)    A business whose goods or services are advertised on a sign posted
in violation of the sign ordinance of the city may be cited by mailing a
Complaint to the registered agent listed for the business on the Secretary of
State’s website or by hand delivery to the business location.
      (9)   A Complaint shall be served upon the alleged offender in person or
by certified mail, return receipt requested, pursuant to the Indiana Rules of
Trial Procedure.
      (10)   In the event any city ordinance does not specifically provide that
the violation thereof is an infraction, then the violation of the ordinance
shall be a Class C infraction. Any subsequent violation within one year of the
judgment of a violation of a first offense shall be a Class B infraction. Each
day of any violation shall be deemed a separate offense.
      (11)   It is the intent of the enforcement procedures of this code of
ordinances that all persons comply with the ordinances of the city. To that
end, the Common Council encourages the use of the Noblesville City Court
Deferral Program pursuant to IC 34-28-5-1(g).

not be taken on any ordinance until the second meeting at which it is
considered except by unanimous vote of the Council. Any other action taken with
regard to the passage or operation of any ordinance shall be done in compliance
with statutory law. This rule does not apply to zoning ordinances.

committee members to replace members no longer in office until the new
committees are appointed.

ordinances are hereby repealed.

§ 35.40 SICK LEAVE FOR POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
   (A)   Sick leave for Police Department.
      (1)   Accrual. Effective September 1, 2005, full-time sworn employees
shall accrue sick leave hours at the rate of seven hours per month, starting
the last day of the first full month of employment. Earned sick leave time
shall be accumulated from year to year, not to exceed 960 hours total. Part-
time employees shall not accrue sick leave.
      (2)   Doctor’s statement required. When an employee is returning to work
from a sick leave of three consecutive days or more, the employee shall have a
statement from his or her physician releasing them to return to work.
      (3)   Illness longer than accrued time. In case of illness or accident
where an employee is off for more than his or her accrued sick time, and he or
she has used all available other time off (vacation, compensation time, etc.),
it shall be the employee’s responsibility to apply to the Local Pension Board
for disability leave. When disability leave is applied for, it shall be done in
accordance with the state law governing policy pensions. If disability leave is
not applied for or not granted, the employee’s salary shall be discontinued
until he or she can return to work.
         (a)   Police officers seriously injured in the line of duty status
shall be paid for 60 work days from the time of injury at normal rate of pay,
with no penalty to sick time, vacation time, comp time, or holiday pay. To
qualify for serious body injury pay in an on-duty status, the Chief of Police
and/or designee must submit complete reports to the Board of Works for
approval. After the 60- day period, must revert back to division (A)(3). Any
PERF Disability payments received during the 60-work-day period, while being
paid by the city, shall be returned to the city.
         (b)   Any extensive illness or injury that is not job-related, where a
police officer that was employed after January 1, 1993, is unable to perform
his or her duties for a period longer than 120 consecutive days, shall be
referred to the Police Pension Board and the Board of Public Works and Safety
for a final disposition. The city will assume its share of the cost for the
police officer insurance premiums for a period of three months while such
police officer is on sick leave. After such period of time, the city shall not
be liable for the insurance premiums unless extended by the appropriate board.
Such leave of absence shall not affect the police officer’s employment
seniority status. Such police officer shall receive his or her regular rate of
pay until otherwise determined by the Pension Board and/or the Board of Public
Works and Safety.
      (4)   Use of sick leave. Sick leave shall only be used for bona fide
illness. During the regular working hours of the employee, he or she shall
remain at home, or at some other location approved by his or her supervisor.
Visits to a physician, a pharmacy or some other type of care facility are
approved during these hours. If a physician orders some other type of rest or
recuperation, the employee must notify his or her supervisor. The Chief of
Police and/or designee may approve this time if an emergency exists in his or
her immediate family (mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, wife,
husband, children, step-children).
      (5)   (a)   If an employee left his or her employment with the city prior
to January 1, 2007, after serving at least 365 days of full-time employment, is
then rehired within one year of separation from employment, and then completes
an additional 365 days of full-time employment, he or she will receive prior
service credit for years worked as a full-time employee, and shall be credited
with the balance of his or her prior sick leave hours.
         (b)   Full-time employees hired prior to January 1, 2018, are entitled
to payment of their unused sick time hours not to exceed a set maximum amount
of hours. The set maximum amount of hours is established per employee. The
maximum amount of sick time hours is determined and set at the highest balance
of sick time hours the employee has accrued during the 2018 calendar year.
Employees will be provided a letter of acknowledgment stating their set maximum
amount of sick time hours. Once acknowledged and signed by the employee, the
letter will remain in the employee’s personnel file.
         (c)   The amount of hours accrued at the time of termination, not to
exceed the set maximum amount of sick time hours per individual, will then be
paid based on their years of full-time service with the city. If an employee
leaves his or her employment with the city on or after January 1, 2007, after
serving at least 365 days of full-time employment, is then rehired within one
year of separation from employment, and then completes an additional 365 days
of full-time employment, he or she will receive prior service credit for years
worked as a full-time employee. However, the rehired employee will not receive
sick time hours left unpaid to him or her at the time of his or her termination
date. The rehired employee will start their re-employment with the city with a
zero sick time balance.
         (d)   Payment of accrued sick time is as follows:
 
Years of Full-time Service Percentage of Sick Time Payout

§ 35.42 JURY DUTY LEAVE FOR POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
   (A)   The city encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities
by serving jury duty when summoned. The pay of any employee who has received a
subpoena for jury duty or as a witness will continue at the regular rate. All
jury duty pay received by the employee shall be returned to the city to be
credited against regular salary. Payment by the court to the employee for
travel expense at the prevailing rate may be retained by the employee.
   (B)   Employees must show the jury duty summons to the department head or
designated supervisor as soon as possible so the city may make arrangements to
accommodate the employee’s absence. The employee is expected to report for work
whenever the court schedule permits. Either the city or the employee may
request an excuse from jury duty if, in the employer’s judgment, the employee’s
absence would create serious operational difficulties.
   (C)   If an employee is released from jury duty with more than half of his
or her regularly scheduled shift remaining, the employee is expected to report
to work.
   (D)   The city will continue to provide and accrue all regular benefits for
the full term of the jury duty absence. Such time spent on jury duty shall be
counted as hours worked in calculating overtime.

§ 35.44 HOLIDAYS.
   (A)   Holidays for sworn police officers.
      (1)   Police officers who work on a city-recognized holiday will be
compensated at the rate of one and one-half times their regular compensation
rate.
      (2)   Police officers shall not be compensated for a city-recognized
holiday if that holiday falls on a day upon which they are otherwise not
scheduled to work.
      (3)   Police officers who are scheduled to work on a city-recognized
holiday and take an approved day off from scheduled work, will receive a paid
holiday at their regular compensation rate and for the number of hours
scheduled to work. If at any time during the approved holiday off the police
officer is called into work, he or she will receive compensation at the rate of
one and one-half times his or her regular compensation rate. The paid holiday
hours will not be reduced by hours worked from being called in. The holiday
hours will be paid in addition to the hours worked during the call-in.
      (4)   For purposes of sworn officers assigned to the Patrol Division
within the Police Department, holiday hours shall be defined as a 24-hour
period commencing at the start of the day shift that begins on the actual
holiday and terminates 24 hours later. For sworn officers not assigned to the
Patrol Division, holiday hours shall be midnight to midnight on the actual
holiday. By way of example, because the Police Department currently starts its
Patrol Division day shift at 5:00 a.m., holiday hours for the Patrol Division
would begin at 5:00 a.m. on the actual holiday and end at 5:00 a.m. the next
day. Because the Police Department needs the flexibility to schedule shifts as
determined by the Police Chief, the 5:00 a.m. start date is not specifically
listed herein and should be determined by the actual practice and procedure
currently established for the department by the Police Chief.
   (B)   Holidays for firefighters. A full-time firefighter working a 56-hour
week who is scheduled to work, or is called to work during any part of a
holiday, shall be paid an additional $10 per hour for those hours worked during
the holiday.
      (1)   In any 28-day pay period in which a full-time firefighter receives
holiday pay shall only be paid overtime when required by Section 207(k) of the
Fair Labor Standards Act found at 29 U.S.C. Section 207(k). Overtime shall be
paid at the time and a half rate as defined in the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The $10 per hour holiday pay shall not be used to calculate time and a half
during that pay period.
      (2)   Effective December 1, 2009, a full-time firefighter working a 40-
hour week called to work during any part of a holiday shall be paid at two
times his or her normal rate of pay.
      (3)   In addition to vacation days, sick days and other days provided by
the policies for payment of police and firefighters for the city, each
firefighter working a 56-hour week shall receive an additional 72 hours of
floating holiday time to be used the same as vacation days in each calendar
year. As of their date of hire, firefighter recruits working a 40-hour week
shall receive 24 hours of floating holiday time to be used the same as vacation
days. Once a recruit is placed on a 24-hour shift, his or her remaining
floating holiday time will be converted to the time given to a firefighter
working a 56- hour week. (For example, a recruit with a remaining 16 hours (two
days) of floating holiday time would have his or her time converted to 48 hours
(two days) of floating holiday time.) Effective January 1, 2009, one 24-hour
float holiday or 24-hour vacation for 56-hour suppression employees may be
taken in increments of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours at the discretion of the
Battalion Chief. Leave under this section may not be taken if it results in
overtime for the Department.
      (4)   The Fire Chief will have the option of “buying back” holidays at
the end of the year, in the event that staffing requirements cannot be met.
Such “buy back” shall be paid at the full-time firefighter’s regular rate of
pay.
      (5)   In the event a firefighter is scheduled to work during a holiday,
but is permitted, as part of a general staff reduction, to be off work for all
or part of the holiday, the firefighter shall have deducted from his or her
holiday time, and/or vacation time, the hours that he or she was regularly
scheduled, but did not work on the holiday, and the firefighter shall be paid
his or her regular rate of pay for the holiday on which he or she was
scheduled.
      (6)   The Board of Works will define designated “holidays” on an annual
basis.

§ 35.441 HOURS WORKED COMPENSATION FOR POLICE.
   (A)   In a 14-day pay period when hours worked are greater than 80 but less
than 86. A sworn officer that has worked more than 80 but less than 86 hours in
a 14-day pay period may be compensated either with pay at the base hourly pay
rate or with an equivalent amount of time off.
   (B)   In a 14-day period when hours worked are in excess of 86. A sworn
officer that has worked more than 86 hours in a 14-day pay period shall be
compensated at the base hourly pay rate for hours worked up to 86 hours. For
the hours in excess of 86, the employee may elect to be paid either at the
officer's overtime hourly pay rate or in an equivalent amount of compensatory
time off as determined by the officer's annual compensatory time-off agreement.
   (C)   Computation of hours worked. For the purpose of calculating the number
of hours worked in a pay period, paid benefit time off, which includes vacation
leave, floating holiday, jury duty, bereavement, holiday hours, worker's
compensation time and sick leave, shall not be deemed to be included as hours
worked in that pay period. See FLSA § 207(e)(2).

§ 35.49 WORKER’S COMPENSATION.
   (A)   The city provides a comprehensive worker’s compensation insurance
program at no cost to employees. This program covers any injury or illness
sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or
hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements, worker’s
compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period. The city
shall pay the employee’s regular salary for the first five work days when such
employee is absent due to a worker’s compensation injury. If absent for six or
more work days, a portion of the regular salary shall be provided via worker’s
compensation insurance. Insurance reimbursement is made directly to the
employee for the first five work days if an employee is absent for 21 work
days. Employees shall reimburse the city the full amount of any worker’s
compensation received for the first five work days. While on worker’s
compensation disability, employee benefits shall accrue.
   (B)   An employee using worker’s compensation time to attend an initial/
follow-up appointment will be paid for this time at normal rate of pay.
Worker’s compensation time is not considered as hours worked for purposes of
calculating overtime compensation. The employee will be paid for this time in
the form of monetary compensation. These hours may not be banked as
compensatory time.
   (C)   It is the responsibility of the employee to report a work-related
injury or illness IMMEDIATELY to his or her direct supervisor, complete the
proper paperwork in a timely manner, and request that an incident report be
completed and submitted to the city’s worker’s compensation carrier. No matter
how minor an on-the-job injury or illness may appear, it is important that it
be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for
coverage as quickly as possible.
   (D)   Neither the city nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the
payment of worker’s compensation benefits for off-duty injuries or injuries
that occur during an employee’s voluntary participation in any off-duty
recreational, social or athletic activity sponsored by the city.

   Holidays and holiday pay for employees are set forth in the City of
Noblesville Civilian Employee Personnel Policy Handbook and are thenceforth
incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. 45-10-18, passed 10-23-18)
§ 36.02 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Accrual. Full-time employees shall accrue sick leave hours at the rate
of six and three-quarters hours per month worked commencing with the month
following the first full month of employment. Part-time, temporary or seasonal
employees shall not accrue sick leave. Earned sick leave days or time shall be
accumulated from year to year, commencing with the month of January, 1991, not
to exceed 120 working days. In case of extended hospitalization and
convalescence due to illness, the department head involved or the appropriate
board may exercise discretion in extending sick leaves.
   (B)   Maximum accumulation and conversion. Full-time employees may accrue up
to, but not to exceed, 120 sick days.
   (C)   Return to work following extended illness. Absence from work due to
illness or accident of 60 calendar days or more duration is termed "extended
illness." An employee absent from work due to illness or accident will be
guaranteed the right to return to the same job, provided he/she returns to work
within 120 calendar days from the last day worked. Whenever an employee is
absent from work due to illness or accident and does not return to work within
120 calendar days, the city will attempt to place him/her in the same or
similar job as soon as possible. It is the employee's responsibility to keep
his/her supervisor informed of his/her progress if he/she is absent from work
due to illness or accident. Whenever an employee is returning from an extended
illness he/she will be required to receive written clearance from his/her
physician and be accepted by the department head. It is necessary for all
employees who have been absent an extended period to follow this procedure so
that their employment status may be activated.
   (D)   In cases of sickness or accident where an employee is absent for more
than his/her accrued sick time, a sick leave of absence (non-paid) in excess of
the 120 days in division (C) above from the last date accrued for sick benefits
for up to six months may be granted and entered on the employee's records, with
a doctor's statement, at which time requests will be subject to review. The
city will assume payment for the employee's insurance premium for three months
while on such sick leave. After this time, the city shall not be liable for the
premium. Such sick leave of absence will not affect the employee's seniority
job status.
   (E)   Malingering. In cases of malingering, the supervisor may designate
such leave vacation, leave without pay, or, as grounds for dismissal. Sick
leave days are not to be used as vacation time nor as holiday extension. They
are for legitimate illness only. Any abuse of the use of sick leave or
excessive absenteeism will result in dismissal or other disciplinary action as
deemed necessary by the department head or appropriate board. After being
absent the first full day, a doctor's statement may be required by the
department head. After being absent three full days, a doctor's statement shall
be required by the department head. Sick leave pay shall only be based upon
bona fide illness. During the regular working hours of the employee, he/she
shall remain at home, or at some other location approved by their supervisor.
Visits to physician, pharmacy or some other type of care facility are approved
during these hours. If a physician orders some other type of rest or
recuperation, the employee must notify his/her supervisor.
   (F)   Accrued sick days status. Employees will not be paid for accumulated
sick days upon termination, resignation, leave of absence or retirement.
(Ord. 46-7-90, passed 8-21-90; Am. Ord. 53-12-92, passed 12-28-92)
§ 36.03 VACATIONS.
   (A)   Accrual. Vacations for regular full-time employees of both civil city
and utility employees will be determined by the following schedule according to
their length of service. The first calendar year will be prorated at the rate
of 6.75 hours per month. Thereafter, vacation will be given on January 1 of
each calendar year as described below:
 
LENGTH OF SERVICE             VACATION

10th through 20th years       Four weeks
Over 20 years                 Five weeks
 
   (B)   Vacations dates. An employee may request the dates of his/her
individual vacation by April 1, of each year, but the final right to allocate
vacation still rests with the department involved in order to preserve
efficiency and provide the necessary service. Employees with the longest
service shall have preference when arranging vacation.
   (C)   When vacation does not accrue. No vacation shall accrue while an
employee is on an unpaid leave of absence. No temporary employee or part-time
employee is eligible to accrue vacation. Vacations may not be taken in advance
of having earned them and only current employment time shall be used in
computing vacation time.
   (D)   Maximum accrual. Vacation time each year may not be accrued beyond the
maximum provided in the preceding table. Vacations may not be carried over from
year to year.
   (E)   Holidays occurring during vacations. If a holiday or holidays occur
during the period of time when an employee is on an authorized vacation, the
employee shall receive a make-up day or days of vacation.

with the city is terminated shall receive payment for the vacation to which he/
she is entitled, less any time off during the current year.

involved. The governing body has determined nepotism shall not exist anywhere
within the chain of command.

enrolled in the City of Noblesville's Medical, Vision and/or Dental Insurance
package at the time of their retirement, death, or disability; and who maintain
coverage continuously from the date of their retirement, death, or disability,
are eligible for benefits under this section. If an employee/elected official
is not enrolled in the City of Noblesville's Medical, Vision and/or Dental
Insurance package, they must enroll during open enrollment in the year prior to
retirement, death, or disability to be eligible for this benefit.
      (7)   The Board of Public Works and Safety may grant the benefit to
employees/elected officials who do not meet the standards presented in this

their family detailing the circumstances surrounding the request prior to Board
of Works recommendation to the Council.
   (B)   Medicare Supplement Coverage for Eligible Retirees at Age 65 and hired

employee or elected official, after the completion of the eligibility
requirements as described in division (A)(1) above, for city-designated
Medicare Supplement Plans. Spouse and dependents of the retiree are not
eligible.
      (2)   It is the sole responsibility of the eligible employee/elected
official to contact the city's designated agent and enroll in the plan. The
eligible employee/elected official is not eligible to enroll for coverage at a
later date if he/she fails to accept the city's coverage or does not enroll
immediately after he/she is no longer eligible for coverage under the City's
Health Insurance Plan due to reaching the age of 65 or immediately after
retirement if the retiree is age 65 or older. The employee/elected official
must accept continuation of the city's coverage at the time of retirement if
they retire before the age of 65. Failure to accept the continuation of
coverage will result in their request being denied at any future date. The
issuance of coverage will be of the sole discretion of the insurance carriers
and the city in no way commits to the coverage being approved.
      (3)   Eligible employees/elected officials do not have to have been
enrolled in the City of Noblesville's Health Plan to be eligible for the
Medicare Supplement benefit. However, the retiree must be in a full-time,
appointed, or elected position on or after January 1, 2007 and hired on or
before January 1, 2018 to qualify and must be Medicare eligible at the time or
retirement. In addition, a retiree hired on or before January 1, 2018, who has

   (C)   Eligible employees/elected officials premium payments.
      (1)   Eligible employees/elected officials who elect to continue their
life insurance coverage must submit the annual premium payment to the city by
January 1 of each year. Life insurance premiums are paid on a yearly basis. If
payment is not received by January 30, a certified letter will be sent to the
member's home address on file notifying the member he/she has 15 calendar days
to submit the annual premium payment. If payment is not received by the date
stated on the certified letter, their life insurance policy will be terminated.
      (2)   Eligible employees/elected officials enrolled in the City's
Medical, Dental, and/or Vision Insurance package and/or Medicare Supplement
Plans must submit premium payments to the city by the first of every month for
coverage for that month. If payment is not received by the 30th of the month in
which it is due, a certified letter will be sent to the member's home address
on file notifying the member he/she has 15 calendar days to submit payment. If
payment is not received by the date stated on the certified letter, retiree
coverage will be terminated for the member and all covered dependents. This
division (C)(2) does not apply to members who have insurance premiums withheld
from their Police and Fire Pension Fund except if the premium amount due
exceeds the maximum amount that may be withheld from their pension.

Certain key employees (as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act) may be

injury to the city.
(Ord. 47-11-93, passed 11-8-93)

   (A)   A travel policy for the City of Noblesville, Hamilton County, Indiana,
is hereby established.
   (B)   Reimbursement Policy for Travel and Related Expenses.
      (1)   Generally. Expenses which are incurred by a city employee related
to that employee’s duties, responsibilities, or actions while participating in
or on behalf of official business shall be reimbursable or non-reimbursable as
described below.
      (2)   Expenses.
         (a)   The authorized use of an employee’s personal vehicle for travel
on official city business shall be reimbursed at the current rate set under §
36.09 of the City Code of Ordinances.

         (a)   Any claim for reimbursement of travel expenses, other than meals
and incidental expenses, incurred while on official business must be documented
by an itemized receipt, approved by the Director of the employee’s department.
         (b)   Any claim for reimbursement of meals and incidental expenses
must be accompanied by proof of travel dates and location and a request form
approved by the Director of the employee’s department to the office of the
Controller to receive a reimbursement. The request form must contain the reason

conference, seminar or school, the employee must also submit an itinerary.
         (c)   Employees may opt to submit for reimbursement payment for meals
and incidental expenses after completing travel on official business, at the
current General Services Administration (GSA) per diem rate. The amount will be
based on the number of days the employee was in travel status on official
business and the location to which the employee traveled. Equivalent amounts
for any meals to be provided as part of a conference registration or funded
from any other source will be subtracted from the authorized reimbursement
payment amount.
         (d)   Prior to submission of a request for reimbursement, the request
must first be reviewed and authorized by the Director of the employee’s

section and is funded with the city’s budget.

      (1)   The city may make an advance payment for meals and incidental
expenses to a city employee traveling on official business, at the current
General Services Administration (GSA) per diem rate. The amount will be based
on the number of days the employee will be in travel status on official
business and the location to which the employee will be traveling. Equivalent
amounts for any meals to be provided as part of a conference registration or
funded from any other source will be subtracted from the authorized advance
payment amount.
      (2)   Any travel expense savings resulting from changes in schedule or
itinerary shall be delivered to the office of the Controller within five
business days of travel completion accompanied by written documentation.
Failure to comply with this provision will result in disciplinary action, up to
and including termination of employment.

office of the Controller to receive a per diem payment in advance. The request
form must contain the reason for travel, travel dates, times of travel, and
locations. For attendance at a conference, seminar or school, the employee must
also submit a detailed, official itinerary.
   (D)   Elected officials.
      (1)   For the purposes of this §
37.03, an elected official shall not be an “employee.”

§ 37.05 PRICE PREFERENCES FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES.
   In order to comply with the terms of I.C. 5-22-15-20.9, the Board of Public
Works and Safety hereby establishes the following policy for determining
whether or not a bidder, quoter, or supplier is entitled to a preference as set
out in I.C. 5-22-15-20.9:
   (A)   Contract preference policy.
      (1)   The terms of this policy apply to any entity ("the Claimant") which
tenders a bid or quote to the city.
      (2)   In order to qualify for a local government preference the claimant
must include its claim for a local Indiana business preference with the quote
or bid and be clearly marked "Claim for Bid Preference".
      (3)   Included in the claim, the claimant must show its principal place
of business which should include the following documentation:
         (a)   Registration with the Indiana Secretary of State, listing an
affected county as the business's primary place of business.
         (b)   Registration of business with County Recorder, listing an
affected county as the business's primary place of business.

the primary place of business.
      (4)   If the claim is based on the claimant's payroll, the claimant must
state that it pays a majority (51% or greater) of its total company payroll to
residents in an affected county. The claim shall include total payroll for the
entire business and the amount of payroll paid to employees residing in the
affected counties. The information must be stated in total dollar values for
the 12 months immediately preceding the bid date.
      (5)   If the claim is based on the number of employees in affected
counties, the claimant shall include information that the claimant employs
residents of affected counties as a majority (51% or greater) of the total
company employees, including the total number of employees of the company, and
the number of employees who are residents of an affected county for the 12
months immediately preceding the bid date.
      (6)   If the claim is based on a "significant capital investment" in the
affected counties, the claimant must define its total investment in real or
depreciable personal property in the affected counties and itemize the
investment in such property in the three calendar years prior to the claim. The
total of the capital investment made in the past three years must exceed 10% of
the average gross income of the Claimant in the past two calendar years.

      (8)   If the bidder is a joint venture and is claiming local preference,
the city will evaluate the joint venture by combining each business’s total
payroll, payroll paid to residents of affected counties, total number of
employees, and total number of employees who are residents of affected
counties. Further, each entity participating in the joint venture shall submit
proof of the location of its principal place of business. The city will
determine whether the joint venture qualifies as a local Indiana business, as
defined herein, by evaluating the joint venture as one business, not as
separate businesses using the criteria set out in subsections (3), (4), and
(5). All members of the joint venture must provide information described above.
The total overall joint venture must qualify as a local Indiana business to
receive the local preference as defined above.
      (9)   The city may request copies of additional documents necessary to
support any allegations included in the claim for bid preference. Failure to
provide such information within 14 days of the request will result in a denial
of the claim for bid preference.

I,             , as  (officer) , of  (company) , verify under the penalties of
perjury that the facts set out in the above claim for Price Preference are

statute.
         (d)   Any claims for the above credit shall continue to be in effect
as long as the rate payer meets the criteria above.
         (e)   Future claims must be filed with the Hamilton County Auditor.
The property owner shall not be eligible for the credit until the first billing
cycle after the claim is filed. Any owner-occupant who has filed a claim, but
does not receive the credit on the wastewater bill, must file a file-marked
copy of the owner's affidavit requesting one of the above deductions.
      (3)   Any owner-occupant of a residential parcel who meets the criteria

be applied retroactively.
         (c)   If the owner-occupant receiving the hardship credit moves to
another residential parcel, the owner-occupant shall supply the documentation
required under 3(a) and may continue to receive the hardship credit on their
new residential parcel account.
         (d)   All credits provided by the City under this subsection may be
granted up to an aggregate total maximum hardship credit amount of $250,000
(“Hardship Credit Cap”). If at any time the application of the hardship credits
under this subsection would exceed the Hardship Credit Cap of $250,000, all
outstanding requests for hardship credits shall be issued on a prorata basis of
the remaining available credits up to the Hardship Credit Cap for any period.
   (B)   The schedule of rates for all other users of the city's sewage works
shall be determined as follows:
      The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water used
on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges, as the
same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge based on
the size of the water meter installed. For the purpose of billing and
collecting the charges for the sewage service, the water meters shall be read
monthly or based on the average monthly usage for the preceding seven months
ending in May based on actual readings. These readings shall be averaged and
the users shall be billed monthly (or a period equaling a month). All new
customers of the wastewater utility shall have service commenced at the monthly
rate based on meter size plus the family residential rate. Upon receiving at
least three readings, the new customer's rate shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (C)   (1)   The rates for the sewage works not included in subsection(A)
above are as follows:
Meter Size September 1, 2024

4 inch                     $622.03
6 inch                     $1,410.69
PLUS a monthly flow charge $5.83
(per 1,000 gallons)
 
      (2)   Unmetered non-residential parcels shall be charged a rate to be
determined by the city on an individual basis by applying the above metered
rates to estimated usage and meter size.
   (D)   There is established a surcharge rate for certain excessive strength
surcharges based on effluent strength as follows:
 
Monthly Per Pound
Excessive Strength Surcharges      Beginning September 1, 2020
(Based on Effluent Strength)
B.O.D. in excess of 250 mg/1       $0.17/lb
S.S. in excess of 250 mg/1         $0.10/lb
Phosphorus between 4.0 - 6.99 mg/1 $1.76/lb
Phosphorus in excess of 7 mg/1     $10.11/lb
 
   (E)   Upon receiving notice that the water meter has become active from any
of the water companies currently serving customers in the city, billing shall
commence immediately. In the event a new customer uses the sewer system prior
to notification to the utility, the utility may bill the new user
retroactively, based upon either: the date a certificate of occupancy is issued
for a new building or residence; or, for existing buildings, the date of
transfer of the real estate, based on the deed recorded in the Office of the
Hamilton County Recorder.
   (F)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be subject to the
same rates and charges hereinabove provided, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith.
   (G)   In order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes, the city
shall charge the user the actual costs of monitoring, but no less than $65 per
sampling event. This charge reimburses the City for the cost of administration
of the sampling.
   (H)   No adjustment to the monthly rate charged to non-residential parcels
shall be applied retroactively for more than three monthly billing cycles. Any
appeal for an adjustment to the monthly rate more than three months prior to
the request for an adjustment is deemed waived.

§ 51.04 ALLOWANCES AND METER REQUIREMENTS.
   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained from
sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by the
city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service
shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as is hereinafter
provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in determining
the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed,
but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such quantities
do not enter the sewage system.
   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the water utility serving the city, and the water used thereon or therein is
not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in
this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense,
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any
adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determining of sewage discharge. The owner or other interested party shall be
responsible for paying the following (but not limited to) costs incurred by the
city for the owner or other interested party’s failure to comply:
      (1)   Costs of installation and operation of the meter;
      (2)   Costs of mileage and labor incurred in care, maintenance, and
operation of the meter; and
      (3)   Other costs associated with the meter operations and maintenance.
   (B)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the
quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case,
for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each
user, and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of
the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings served
through the single water meter.
   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharges
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city's
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of
10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city
that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.
   (D)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as
for other uses not entering the sewer system, the city may, in its discretion,
make adjustments in the user charge as may be equitable.
(Ord. 1589, passed - - ; Am. Ord. 64A-8-89, passed 8-28-89; Am. Ord. 17-07-20,
passed 7-28-20; Am. Ord. 43-10-23, passed 11-14-23)
§ 51.05 BASIS OF CHARGES.
   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not
only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-
than-normal domestic sewage, and shall require the user to determine the
strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or
indirectly into the sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the
city may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user
shall furnish a sampling point, as defined in the sewer use ordinance,
available to the city at all times.
   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical
oxygen demand of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in
excess of 250milligrams per liter of fluid or phosphorous in excess of 4
milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-than-
normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:
      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.10 per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids
received in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon B.O.D. There shall be an additional
charge of $0.17 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for B.O.D. received in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.
      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon phosphorous. There shall be an additional
charge of $1.76 per pound of phosphorous received in excess of four (4)
milligrams per liter of fluid up to 6.99 milligrams per liter of fluid. There
shall be an additional charge of $10.11 per pound of phosphorous received in
excess of 7 milligrams per liter of fluid.

§ 51.06 BILLING PROCEDURES; DELINQUENT CHARGES.
   (A)   Rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the city
in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
   (B)   Beginning July 1, 2013, the rates and charges for all residential
rental properties shall be charged to the owner of the real estate as shown by
the land records maintained by the Hamilton County Auditor. The rates and
charges may be billed to the tenant of non-residential properties served by the
sewage works. Such billing of rental properties shall in no way relieve the
owner from liability in the event payment is not made as herein required, nor
does such billing restrict the city from any collection procedures, including
filing of liens. The owners of properties, which are occupied by a tenant or
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for
the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or
tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office of the
Wastewater Department during the hours that such office is open for business.
   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are
hereby declared to be delinquent, and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which the rates or
charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of the
bill.

§ 51.07 STUDIES OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   In order to assure the rates and charges for sewage services are
properly allocated pursuant to statute, and that said charges may remain
sufficient to adequately fund the necessary replacement costs and other revenue
and reserve requirements, the city shall periodically cause a study to be made
concerning the rates charged by the city. Such study shall include, but not be
limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive
strength effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial
position of the sewage works and the sufficiency of its revenue to provide
adequate funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt service
requirements and capital improvements to the waste treatment systems.
   (B)   These studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city
or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers
which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of
officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city
shall determine to be best under the circumstances.

§ 51.16 AVAILABILITY COSTS.
   (A)   There are hereby established as of the effective date of this section
availability for all new users of the City Sewage Works availability and
connection fees of five thousand six hundred dollars ($5,600) per Equivalent
Dwelling Unit (EDU). For purposes of this section, one EDU shall be defined as
the average use of 310 gallons of wastewater flow per day over one calendar
year. Table 11-1 of Section 327 IAC 3-6-11, shall be used to determine the
number of EDUs for all users, unless the Board of Public Works and Safety of
the City of Noblesville determines to the contrary. EDU calculations will be
rounded to the nearest 0.1 of an EDU. For example a calculation of 0.05 EDU
would round up to 0.1 EDU and a calculation of 0.04 EDU would round down to
0.00 EDU.
   (B)   Additional funds contributed. The above availability costs shall be
strictly nonrefundable. If by prior agreement, in order to extend the trunk
sewerage system, additional funds are necessary to extend the sewer to the
owners of real estate, such additional funds, advanced or contributed by said
owners of real estate for the extensions and/or oversizing to meet the
requirements of the city, are refundable, without interest. However, such
refunds may be made only from funds deposited at a future date by owners of
real estate benefited under such terms and conditions as the city shall, from
time to time, set forth. In no event will any of the city sewerage revenues be
used, committed, or encumbered to repay any such funds advanced or contributed,
nor will the City's General Fund be used, committed or encumbered to repay any
such funds advanced or contributed. It is expressly declared that such
repayment, if any, will be made under the provisions of and will be repaid only
from funds deposited in the Interceptor Fund on the basis of first in, first
out. No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as a guarantee by the
city that the owners of real estate advancing funds will be fully reimbursed
therefor.
   (C)   The requirements of this section shall not be applicable to any
rehabilitation, change of use or improvement to an existing building located
within the Core Central Business District (CCBD) of Noblesville as the district
is hereafter defined, except as specifically limited or restricted herein.

as shall be administered and defined by the Board of Public Works and Safety
for the City of Noblesville.
   (D)   Easements, as are required by the Board of Public Works and Safety,
for the extension of sewers across the land of a developer shall be prepared
and dedicated without cost by the owner of the real estate. Other easements may
be acquired pursuant to law.
   (E)   Credits and Reimbursements. Any owner of real estate, which either (1)
including an extension of an interceptor sewer defined in the City Interceptor
Improvement Master Plan (hereinafter referred to as "the Master Plan"); or (2)
is served, or should be served, by an interceptor sewer to provide extensions
of the city sewer system to other real estate; shall be required to extend the
interceptors through their property, under the terms and conditions set out in
this division. For purposes of this division, the following definitions apply:
      "INTERCEPTOR COSTS." Sewer costs external to a development, including the
costs of oversizing, or extending an interceptor through a development which
costs would not be incurred if the interceptor was only being constructed or
extended to serve present development.
      "LOCAL SEWER COSTS." Sewer costs incurred because of the development
being served. Local sewer shall be extended to the next upstream property line
and have six feet (6') of cover based on the lowest ground elevation along the
property line. Local sewer shall have a minimize diameter size of eight inches
(8").
      "OVERSIZING COSTS." Shall be the difference between the interceptor costs
and the local sewer costs, including oversizing, construction of lift stations
and other costs which would not be necessary, but for the developer's project,
but are only costs of construction constructed in order to benefit real estate
off-site of the property owned by persons other than the developer.
   (F)   The developer may recover his oversizing costs pursuant to the terms
of an agreement for off-site extensions of sewer mains and related facilities
in a form approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety. The reimbursement
agreement shall be negotiated by the City Engineer and approved by the Board of
Public Works and Safety prior to secondary plat approval of the developer. The
amount of oversizing costs due the developer shall be paid through credits and
reimbursements as set out herein. The developer, or his designee, shall receive
credits for his or her liability to the Interceptor Account as set out above.
To the extent that the credits would not be sufficient to reimburse the
developer for his or her oversizing costs, the developer shall be entitled to
reimbursement of costs without interest, which may include up to ten percent
(10%) of the design cost of the oversized sewer. Those funds shall be paid
solely from the Interceptor Account set out herein and shall be paid to the
developer from the funds in that account based on availability and prioritized
based upon the dates which the developer's Reimbursement Agreement is approved
by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
   (G)   Extension of interceptor sewers shall be, in accordance with the
latest Master Plan, developed and approved by the City of Noblesville, and
interceptor sewers designed by registered professional and state licensed
engineers retained or approved by the City of Noblesville. Plans and
specifications for specific interceptor sewers shall be submitted and receive
approval from the City of Noblesville and all applicable regulatory agencies
prior to the start of construction (a copy of all such approvals shall be filed
with the City of Noblesville within ten days after receipt of approval). In no
event will any of the city sewer revenues be used, committed or encumbered to
repay any such funds advanced or contributed, nor will the City's General Fund
be used, committed or encumbered to repay any such funds advanced or
contributed other than expressly agreed pursuant to division (E) above. Such
repayment, if any, will be made under the provisions of division (E) and will
be repaid only from funds deposited in the Interceptor Account. No provision of
this section shall be construed as a guarantee by the City of Noblesville that
the owners of real estate advancing funds will be fully reimbursed therefor.
The amount of credits and reimbursements will be based on construction costs
for labor and materials only and will be based on city standard costs as
updated annually from receipt of no less than two (2) bid quotations. Design
fees, easement expenses, legal expenses, interest, or any costs other than the
labor and materials for the oversizing costs shall not exceed ten percent (10%)
of the design costs of the oversized sewer unless expressly agreed by the Board
of Public Works and Safety in writing.
   (H)   The connection fees paid at the time of plat approval shall be
strictly nonrefundable.
   (I)   All plans for interceptor sewers and appurtenances thereto, to be
installed outside the area being developed by the applicant (i.e. off-site
sewers) shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Indiana law. All
easements shall be granted to the City of Noblesville, and shall be obtained by
and, if necessary, paid for by the owners of real estate. The easement(s) shall
be obtained prior to engineering design of the project. Easements shall be in a
form approved by the city.
   (J)   All extensions to the City of Noblesville sewerage systems shall be
dedicated to and must be accepted by the city before connection, and once
connected, shall become and remain thereafter the sole property of the City of
Noblesville without further dedication thereof. The owners of real estate
making such dedication shall post at the time of dedication, three (3) years
maintenance bond equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the project cost in a form
acceptable to the city. Other bonds may be required by Noblesville's Unified
Development Ordinance. Owners of real estate shall agree and furnish an
affidavit that they have paid in full contractor or contractors, material, men
and laborers in cash the full cost of said extension or extensions.
   (K)   In accordance with this section and the City's Unified Development
Ordinance, the owners of real estate obtaining a permit of sewerage extensions
shall submit plans for on-site sewers, including trunk sewers to be constructed
within the development, to the City of Noblesville for review and approval
prior to start of construction. During construction of said on-site sewers, the
owners of real estate shall pay the expense of an inspector to assure that the
construction of the facilities are in compliance with current standards and
specifications established by the City of Noblesville. Upon completion of
construction, the owners of real estate shall provide certified record
construction drawings to the city within thirty (30) days. If certified record
construction drawings are not provided as required, the city may prepare these
at the expense of said owners of real estate. No potential reimbursable
expenses of oversizing and/or off-site interceptor construction will be allowed
until record drawings are provided and approved. The city will provide the
inspector or may approve, in writing, an inspector designated by the owners of
real estate. The owners of real estate will pay the inspection costs, costs for
televising required prior to the approval of the secondary plat and costs for
televising required six (6) months prior to the expiration of the maintenance
bond to the City of Noblesville to be deposited into the Engineering Inspection
Services Account The inspection costs are set by the City's Unified Development
Ordinance.
   (L)   Individual Connections in Developed Areas. If individual applicants
for sewage service in already developed acreage and/or platted subdivisions
wish to be served requiring construction of a new trunk sewer or local sewers,
they shall obtain a permit. If a connection is made to any trunk or local sewer
without obtaining a permit and paying the required availability, connection and
local sewer costs, such act shall constitute a violation of this section, and
the individual or owners of real estate making such connection will be subject
to a fine of one hundred dollars ($100) per day for each day the connection was
unlawfully installed, and will be required to remove the connection until the
requirements of the ordinance are complied with. Each day such unlawful
connection exists may be considered a separate offense.
   (M)   This section and the costs and charges set out herein may be amended
from time to time by the Common Council of the City of Noblesville when
conditions exist that indicate to the Common Council that charges herein are
not equitable for the customers of the municipal sewage system or for the
subdividers, developers, or owners of property connection to such sewage
system.

ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION
§ 52.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Noblesville ("the city") through
the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This
subchapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants
into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit. The objectives of this subchapter are:
   (A)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater
discharges by any user.
   (B)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the city's separate
storm sewer system.
   (C)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 23-4-05, passed 4-26-05)
§ 52.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply,
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs).” Structural or nonstructural practices,
or a combination of practices, designed to act as effective, practicable means
of minimizing the impacts of development and human activities on water quality.
Traditional structural BMPs, including extended detention dry ponds, wet ponds,
infiltration trenches, and sand filtration systems, are now common elements of
most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational
settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a porous medium
for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used independently or
in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider breadth of mechanisms
to prevent or control NPS pollution. Nonstructural BMPs range from programs
that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the implementation of
control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and stormwater wetlands) that
utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and restore the infiltrative
capacity of the landscape.
   “CLEAN WATER ACT (CWA).” The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
1251 et seq.), and any subsequent amendments thereto.
   “CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.” Activities subject to NPDES construction permits.
These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one acre
or more, as defined in the Indiana Annotated Code (IAC) by 327 IAC 15-5-1:12
(Rule 5). Such activities include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing,
grading, excavating, and demolition.
   “HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.” Any material, including any substance, waste, or
combination thereof, which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical,
chemical, or infectious characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute
to, a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, safety,
property, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported,
disposed of, or otherwise managed.
   “ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.” Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows an Illicit Discharge to enter the Storm Drainage
System including but not limited to any conveyances which allow any non-
Stormwater discharge including sewage, process Wastewater, and wash water to
enter the Storm Drainage System and any connections to the Storm Drainage
System from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or
connection had been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by an authorized
enforcement agency or, Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the Storm Drainage System which has not been documented
in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by an authorized enforcement
agency.
   “ILLICIT DISCHARGE.” Any direct or indirect non-stormwater discharge to the
storm drainage system, except as exempted in §
52.07 of this subchapter.
   “INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY.” Activities subject to NPDES Industrial Permits as
defined by 327 IAC 15-6-1:12 (Rule 6).
   “MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP).” MEP is the statutory standard that
establishes the level of pollutant reductions that operators of regulated MS4s
must achieve. The CWA requires that NPDES permits for discharges from MS4s
"shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum
extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and
system, design and engineering methods." This standard applies to all MS4s
regulated under the Phase I and Phase II (Rule 13) Stormwater Rules. Compliance
with the conditions of Rule 13 and the series of steps associated with
implementation of the required six minimum control measures will satisfy the
MEP standard. Compliance with the six minimum control measures requires the
development and implementation of BMPs. Implementation of the BMPs includes not
only the actions necessary to initiate and continue the use of specific control
measures, but also the enforcement actions, as applicable, to ensure that the
implementation of the control measures occurs.
   “MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4).” A conveyance or system of
conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch
basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains), which are
owned or operated by a state, city, town, county, tribe, district, association,

permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this subchapter.
   (G)   If the Noblesville Wastewater Utility has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(Ord. 23-4-05, passed 4-26-05)
STORMWATER RUNOFF ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION AND POST-CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES
§ 52.30 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the
dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause
the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
Following the completion of construction activities, dust, dirt, and erosion
will continue to affect the stormwater facilities and receiving streams unless
post-construction practices are put in place during the construction and
maintained in perpetuity.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the City of
Noblesville ("the city"). This subchapter will also promote the public welfare
by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and
maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the
topsoil or results in the movement of earth in the city.
   (C)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. This subchapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
      (2)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
      (4)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
(Ord. 24-4-05, passed 4-26-05)
§ 52.31 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply,
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “AGRICULTURAL LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY.” Tillage, planting, cultivation, or
harvesting operations for the production of agricultural or nursery vegetative
crops. The term also includes pasture renovation and establishment, the
construction of agricultural conservation practices, and the installation and
maintenance of agricultural drainage tiles. For the purposes of this
subchapter, the term does not include land disturbing activities for the
construction of agricultural-related facilities such as barns, buildings to
house livestock, roads associated with infrastructure, other infrastructure,
agricultural waste lagoons and facilities that process residential, workshop,

most new development projects. Structural BMPs rely heavily on gravitational
settling and/or the infiltration of soluble nutrients through a porous medium
for pollutant removal. Nonstructural BMPs, which may be used independently or
in conjunction with structural BMPs, rely on a much wider breadth of mechanisms
to prevent or control NPS pollution. Nonstructural BMPs range from programs
that increase public awareness to prevent pollution, to the implementation of
control-oriented techniques (such as bioretention and stormwater wetlands) that
utilize vegetation to enhance pollutant removal and restore the infiltrative
capacity of the landscape.

   “CONTRACTOR OR SUBCONTRACTOR.”An individual or company hired the project
site owner, or by an individual lot owner or individual lot operator to perform
services on or connected to the project site or individual lot.
   “DEVELOPER.” Any person financially responsible for construction activity;
or an owner of property who sells or leases, or offers for sale or lease, any
lots in a subdivision.
   “EROSION.”The detachment and movement of soil, sediment, or rock fragments
by water, wind, ice, or gravity.
   “EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURE.” A practice, or a combination of
practices, to control erosion and resulting sedimentation.
   “EROSION CONTROL.”A measure that prevents erosion.
   “GRADING.” The cutting and filling of the land surface to a desired slope or
elevation.
   “LAND DISTURBANCE OR LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY.” Any manmade change of the
land surface, including removing vegetative cover that exposes the underlying
soil, excavating, filling, transporting, and grading.
   “MEASURABLE STORM EVENT.” A precipitation event that results in a total
measured precipitation accumulation equal to, or greater than, one-half inch of
rainfall.
   “NOBLESVILLE WASTEWATER UTILITY.” Employees or designees of the Director of
the Noblesville Wastewater Utility designated to enforce this subchapter.
   “PROJECT SITE.” The entire area on which construction activity is to be
performed.

established under IC 14-32.
   “STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP).”A plan developed to minimize
the impact of stormwater pollution resulting from construction and post-
construction activities. The plan indicates the specific measures and
sequencing to be used to control sediment, soil erosion and other construction
site wastes during and after construction.
   “STORMWATER QUALITY MEASURE.”A practice, or a combination of practices, to
control or minimize pollutants associated with stormwater run-off.
   “SUBDIVISION.”Any land that is divided or proposed to be divided into lots,
whether contiguous or subject to zoning requirements, for the purpose of sale
or lease as part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
   “TECHNICAL REVIEW AND COMMENT FORM.”A form issued by the Noblesville
Wastewater Utility stating that the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan is
adequate or stating revisions needed in the SWPPP.

§ 52.35 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Erosion and sediment control measures shall be designed and installed
in accordance with Rule 5, the Noblesville Standards Manual, and the Indiana
Storm Water Quality Manual. Unless judged by the Noblesville Wastewater Utility
to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be
addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
      (1)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
      (2)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters
of the United States without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are
proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a method acceptable to the jurisdictional stormwater authority.
In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by
the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods.
      (4)   For new development, structural Best Management Practices (BMPs)
shall be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total
suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a BMP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
         (a)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (Wqv);
         (b)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined
in the local stormwater design manual;
         (c)   Constructed properly; and
         (d)   Maintained regularly.
   (B)   A list of pre-approved post-construction BMPs along with procedures to
be followed for approval of innovative BMPs or BMPs not in the pre-approved
list are provided in the Noblesville Standards and Specifications.
(Ord. 24-4-05, passed 4-26-05)
§ 52.36 INSPECTION.
   (A)   A self-monitoring program is required during construction. A trained
individual shall prepare and maintain a written evaluation of the project site
by the end of the next business day following each measurable storm event and
at a minimum, one time per week.
   (B)   The evaluation must address the maintenance of existing stormwater
quality measures to ensure they are functioning properly; and identify
additional measures necessary to remain in compliance with all applicable
statutes and rules.
   (C)   Written evaluation reports must include the following:
      (1)   The name of the individual performing the evaluation;
      (2)   The date of the evaluation;
      (3)   Problems identified at the project site; and
      (4)   Details of corrective actions recommended and completed.
   (D)   All evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to
the inspecting authority within 48 hours of a request.
   (E)   All persons engaging in construction activities on a project site must
comply with the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, this subchapter, Rule 5
and the Noblesville Standards and Specifications.
   (F)   The Noblesville Wastewater Utility will perform inspections and
provide recommendations to evaluate the installation, implementation and
maintenance of control measures and management practices at any project site
involved in construction activities. Construction project sites will be
prioritized based on the nature and extent of the construction activity,
topography and the characteristics of soils and receiving water quality
   (G)   If after a recommendation is provided to the project site owner,
corrective action is not taken, the Noblesville Wastewater Utility will pursue
enforcement according to §
52.37 of this subchapter.
(Ord. 24-4-05, passed 4-26-05)
§ 52.37 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Written Notification. In the event the Noblesville Wastewater Utility,
the designated entity's planning department, or other regulatory agency
determines the project is not in compliance with this subchapter, Rule 5 or the
Noblesville Drainage Standards and Specifications, the project site owner will
be issued a written notification form. The written notification may be in the
form of a warning letter of noncompliance or violation notice.
   (B)   Penalties. Any site owner who has not corrected a deficiency within
five days after written notification shall be subject to the penalty set forth
in §
52.99(B).
   (C)   Stop-Work Order (Revocation of Permit). In the event that any person
holding a site development permit pursuant to this subchapter violates the
terms of the permit or implements site development in such a manner as to
materially aversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing
or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the neighborhood, the Director of the Noblesville Wastewater Utility may
suspend or revoke the site development permit.
   (D)   Restitution. Any agency charged with enforcement of this subchapter,
under division (A) above, may after a five-day notice, enter a construction

PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
§ 53.035 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
53.015 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the Utility
Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Utility Director for review. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
utility under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.036 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Utility Director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Utility Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.120 INFORMAL NOTICE.
   The Utility Director may issue an informal notice it will be either a
documented phone call, written warning, or a meeting notifying the IU of minor
incidences that have occurred and that need to be corrected. Repeat performance
of the same incidence or escalation of the incidence will result in escalated
enforcement action.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.121 NOTICE OF VIOLATION (NOV).
   When the Utility Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an IDEM discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Director may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. This
Notice of Violation does not relieve the user from any penalties or notices
issued by IDEM. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, as well as increased sampling of
the parameter in violation within 30 days, shall be submitted by the IU to the
Utility Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Utility
Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.122 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER.
   The Utility Director may enter into administrative orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. This will be the first formal response to
significant noncompliance (unless factors necessitate escalated enforcement
actions). The Director may require compliance schedules, administrative fines,
termination of service and show cause orders. In addition, it specifies the
name of the parties involved, statement of the facts, the requirement to ensure
compliance and the enforcement associated with any future non-compliance and
shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 53.123 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Utility Director may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Utility Director and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 21 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.124 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE; ORDER.
   When the Utility Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an IDEM discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified scheduled time.
This will contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to compliance. Compliance
schedules also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. A compliance schedule may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard
or requirement, nor does a compliance schedule relieve the user of liability
for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
schedule shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. In addition, all compliance schedules shall contain
the following:
   (A)   Monitoring requirements with the location for monitoring;
   (B)   How the data will be used for evaluating compliance;
   (C)   Enforcement associated with non-compliance; and
   (D)   Closure date after which IU will be considered either non-compliant
with the established compliance schedule, or evaluated for compliance.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.125 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Utility Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an IDEM discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Utility Director may issue
an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.126 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Utility Director finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an IDEM discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Utility Director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such
fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user’s property
will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Utility Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the Utility Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Utility Director may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine. When assessing an administrative fine the following factors are
considered:
      (1)   Type and severity of the violation;
      (2)   Number of violations cited;
      (3)   Duration of noncompliance;
      (4)   Impact of the violation on the receiving water, sludge quality, and
POTW operation;
      (5)   Whether the violation threatened public health;
      (6)   The economic benefit or savings the industrial user gained from the
noncompliance;
      (7)   Compliance history of the industrial user; and
      (8)   Whether the industrial user is making a good faith effort to
comply.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.127 TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The Utility Director may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Utility Director may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utility Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Utility Director
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Utility Director that the period of endangerment has
passed.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Utility Director prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.128 COST RECOVERY.
   In addition to administrative fines imposed by the Director, the IU shall be
responsible for paying the following (but not limited to) costs incurred by the
city for the IU’s failure to comply:
   (A)   Cost of mileage and labor incurred in detecting and correcting the
violation;
   (B)   Laboratory analysis costs associated with detecting and correcting the
violation;
   (C)   Additional treatment costs caused by the violation or associated with
detecting and correcting the violation;
   (D)   Costs of any additional equipment acquired or expended by city/town
for detecting or correcting the violation;
   (E)   Repair and/or replacement of any part of the sewerage system damaged
by the violation;
   (F)   Any liability, damages, fines or penalties incurred by city/town as a
result of the violation;
   (G)   Any and all expenses of outside professionals to include, but not
limited to, engineers, scientists, and/or legal counsel; and
   (H)   Other costs associated with the detection and correction of the
violations.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
§ 53.140 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   The Utility Director may submit to IDEM recommendation to decline their
discharge permit for any user who has failed to comply with any provision of
this chapter, a previously issued IDEM discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user
first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to
restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 53.141 PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   A violation of any provision of this chapter, IDEM discharge permit limits,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the Utility Director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of the City Of Noblesville Code governing such
nuisances, including reimbursing the Utility for any costs incurred in
removing, abating, or remedying the nuisance.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 53.155 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, “UPSET” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An “UPSET” does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Utility
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days]:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.156 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.015(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §§
53.015(B)(3) through (17) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   The user’s IDEM NPDES issues permit limits exist for each pollutant
discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to,
and during, the pass through or interference; or
   (B)   The user does not require an IDEM NPDES permit, but the discharge did
not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior
discharge when the Utility was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit,
and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use
or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.157 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “BYPASS.” The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user’s pretreatment facility.
      (2)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.” Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Utility Director, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Utility Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Utility Director may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utility Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Utility Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Utility Director determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES INDUSTRIAL/COMMERCIAL
§ 53.170 METERED WATER SUPPLY.
   User charges and fees shall be based upon the total amount of water used
from all users unless, in the opinion of the Director, significant portions of
water received are not discharged to a sanitary sewer. The total amount of
water used from public and private sources will be determined by means of
public meters or private meters, installed and maintained at the expense of the
user and approved by the Director.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
§ 53.171 METERED WASTEWATER VOLUME AND METERED DIVERSIONS.
   For users where a significant portion of the water received from any metered
source in excess of 10,000 gallons per month and does not flow into the
sanitary sewer because of the principal activity of the user or removal by
other means, the user charges and fees may be applied against the volume of
water discharged from such premises into the community sewer. Written
notification and proof of the diversion of water must be provided by the user
if the user is to avoid the application of the user charges and fees against
the total amount of water used from all sources. The user may install a meter
of a type and at a location approved by the Director and at the user’s expense.
Such meters that measure the amount of sewage discharge shall be certified and
calibrated for accuracy at least once per year at the expense of the user and
when deemed necessary by the Director.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
SURCHARGE COSTS
§ 53.185 SURCHARGE COSTS.
   (A)   (1)   Each user discharging wastewater into the sanitary sewers shall
be subject to a surcharge in addition to the regular sewage service charge
based on content of the waste based on the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),
suspended solids (SS) and phosphorous content of the wastes, if the wastes have
a concentration higher than 300 mg/L of BOD, 350 mg/L of SS or 15 mg/L of
phosphorous.
      (2)   Other pollutants may be included as deemed necessary.
   (B)   Sampling and testing for surcharges or use charges. The discharged
wastewater will be sampled during each sewage billing period for minimum of a
one-day period (24 continuous hours) by means of a composite sample. An
extended sampling period of up to one week (seven continuous days) or reduction
may be requested to enable the gathering of a sample representative of a
company’s wastewater. The extension or reduction of the sampling period beyond
the initial one-day sampling period maybe requested by either the sewer user
involved or the City of Noblesville. If an extended sampling period is
requested, the parameter values used to calculate the surcharge will be the
arithmetical average of the individual values. In the event a company or
industry has multiple discharges of wastewater, each discharge shall be sampled
according to quality. If significant process changes are made to affect quality
of any discharge, resampling may be requested by either the sewer user involved
or the city.
   (C)   These tests shall be made in accordance with the latest editions of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water or by an approved EPA method.
   (D)   Computation of surcharge.
      (1)   Biochemical Oxygen Demand (B.O.D.) in excess of 300 mg/L $0.07 per
pound of BOD.
      (2)   Suspended Solids (S.S.) in excess of 350 mg/L $0.06 per pound of
SS.
      (3)   Phosphorous in excess of 15 mg/L $0.51 per pound of Phosphorous.
(Ord. 10-04-12, passed 4-10-12)
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

§ 53.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Utility Director finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, IDEM
discharge permit limits, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Utility Director may petition the appropriate
Court through the Utility’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement
imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Utility Director may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, IDEM discharge permit limits, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Utility for a
minimum civil penalty of at least $1,000 per day, per violation, in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(A), but no more than $2,500 per day, per violation
for a first violation nor more than $7,500 per day, per violation for
subsequent violations, in accordance with I.C. 36-1-3-8(a)(10)(B). In the case
of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue
for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Utility Director may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the Utility.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a barrier against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, IDEM discharge permit limits, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.
      (2)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$1,000, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. This
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury
or property damage available under Indiana law.
      (3)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
IDEM discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers
with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required
under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than $5,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than three
years, or both.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine of not more than $10,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than five years, or both.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive; The Utility Director may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the Utility’s enforcement
response plan. However, the Utility Director may take other action against any
user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Utility Director is empowered
to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
   (E)   Judicial action. Judicial action will be taken when it is deemed
necessary to force the IU to correct the violation and comply with the permit.
Judicial action may consist of civil prosecution; criminal prosecution; or an
action for injunction, at the discretion of the POTW and its counsel. As an
alternative to judicial action, the POTW and IU may agree to a voluntary zero
discharge of industrial waste by the IU pending correction of the violation.

   (A)   Abatement of public nuisances. Any violation of
Chapter 93 shall be deemed a nuisance, and the Designated Department is
authorized to give written notice by mail to property owners ordering them to
abate the nuisance.
   (B)   Summary abatement.
      (1)   Inspection of premises. Whenever a complaint is made to the
Designated Department that a public nuisance exists or has existed within the
city, the Designated Department shall forthwith inspect or cause to be
inspected the premises and, whenever practicable, the inspecting officer shall
cause photographs to be made of the premises and shall file the same in the
Planning Department.
      (2)   Notice to owner. If the inspecting officer shall determine that a
public nuisance exists on private property and that there is danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, the Designated Department may
serve a notice on the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such
notice shall direct the owner, to abate or remove the nuisance within ten days
and shall state that unless such nuisance is so abated, the city will cause the
nuisance to be abated and will charge the cost thereof to the owner.
      (3)   In the event that the city has to abate a violation of this section
due to owner noncompliance, the city shall issue a bill to the owner of the
real property for the costs incurred by the city in abating the violation,
including administrative costs and removal costs. The bill shall be sent by the
Planning Department by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal or
copy service upon the land owner if he or she is a resident of the city, or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to his or her last known
address if he or she is a non-resident of the city. The bill shall be paid
within 30 days of receipt by the owner of the real property.
      (4)   In the event that the bill described in division (B)(3) of this
section is not paid to the city Planning Department within 30 days, the
Director of the Planning Department shall certify to the Hamilton County
Auditor the amount of the bill, plus any additional administrative costs
incurred in the certification. Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-10.1-4, the Hamilton
County Auditor shall place the total amount certified on the tax duplicate for
the property affected, and the total amount, including any accrued interest,
shall be collected as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to
the general fund of the city.
      (5)   Any property owner wishing to appeal a notice of violation or a
bill received due to the city’s abatement of the violation must submit a
written request for appeal to the Director of the Planning Department within
ten days of receipt. The Director of the Department of Planning shall then
issue his written findings within ten days after receipt of the appeal. The
findings of the Director of Planning are subject to review by the city Board of
Public Works and Safety if a request for review is filed with the Office of the
Clerk-Treasurer by the property owner within ten days of the receipt of the
Director’s written findings.
   (C)   Great and immediate danger and abatement by court action.
      (1)   If the inspecting officer shall determine that a public nuisance
exists on private property and that there is great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, the Designated Department may
direct the chief of police, or a deputy sheriff, to serve a notice on the owner
or, if the owner cannot be found, on the occupant or person causing,
permitting, or maintaining such nuisance and to post a copy of the notice on
the premises. Such notice shall direct the owner, occupant, or person causing,
permitting, or maintaining the nuisance to abate or remove the nuisance within
24 hours.
      (2)   Abatement by court action. If the inspecting officer shall
determine that a public nuisance exists on private premises but that the nature
of such nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency; the property owner has not
responded to written notice; and abatement by the city is not feasible, the
inspecting officer shall initiate an enforcement action in the Noblesville City
Court to abate such nuisance in the name of the city.

§ 94.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulations of this chapter are intended to protect the city and its
citizens from unnecessary expenses related to private construction and use of
the public right-of-way. The city is responsible for maintaining all streets
and structures accepted within Noblesville right-of-way, therefore, it is
necessary to set minimum standards for obstruction of right-of-way and the
construction of all improvements. These minimum standards protect, maintain,
and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare. The city is
responsible for all these improvements, and in order to avoid assuming
unnecessary maintenance costs and inconvenience to the citizens and businesses
of the city reasonable permit and inspection requirements for these activities
are necessary. For the purpose of this chapter, an encroachment shall be any
activity within a public right-of-way or city easement.

   (A)   Improvement defined. As used in this section, "IMPROVEMENT" means any
alteration to land or any other physical construction on the land.
   (B)   Compliance with the State Route 32 Overlay District. All development
in the SR 32 Overlay District must comply with the SR 32 Overlay District. In
the event some development is not governed by the SR 32 Overlay District or is
not otherwise subject to the Planning Department's ordinary improvement-
location-permitting process, the property owner and/or developer may not
construct any improvement on a parcel of property that abuts the Midland Trace
public recreational trail, or that is within 600 feet from the boundary of the
Midland Trace public recreational trail (whichever distance is greater), unless
it first obtains a permit from the Common Council as set forth herein.
Cross-reference:
   For the requirements for development in the State Road 32 Overlay District,
see §
159.109(J)
   (C)   Permit application.
      (1)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, shall prepare a permit
application form, seeking at least the following information from any person,
corporation, business, publicly held trust, or any other entity seeking to
construct any improvement that is not governed by the SR 32 Overlay District or
is not otherwise subject to the Planning Department's ordinary improvement-
location-permitting process on a parcel of property that abuts the Midland
Trace public recreational trail, or that is within 600 feet from the boundary
of the Midland Trace public recreational trail (whichever distance is greater):
         (a)   The name of the applicant;
         (b)   The location of the proposed improvement;
         (c)   A description of proposed improvement;
         (d)   How the proposed improvement will minimize impact to the Midland
Trace public recreational trail;
         (e)   Any other information the Mayor or his or her designee
determines is necessary.
      (2)   The city may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed $300, to any
applicant seeking to apply for such permit.
   (D)   Within 90 days after receipt of the application, the Mayor, or his or
her designee, shall submit a written report to the Common Council with a
recommendation on whether to approve or not approve the requested improvement.
Factors the Mayor shall consider in making such a recommendation are as
follows:
      (1)   Whether the applicant has proposed the least intrusive means of
constructing the proposed improvement;
      (2)   Whether the improvement as proposed endangers the public health,
safety, or general welfare of the community (and in particular those using or
living along the Midland Trace public recreational trail), and if so, how;
      (3)   Whether the applicant has taken reasonable measures to mitigate any
potential dangers to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the
community, and if so, what those measures are;
      (4)   Whether the applicant has considered the aesthetic impact of the
proposed improvement on the surrounding property, and particularly to that area
along, under, upon, and across the Midland Trace public recreational trail;
      (5)   Whether there are alternate means or locations to construct the
proposed improvement; and
      (6)   A cost benefit analysis, weighing other alternatives to the
proposed improvement, if any, with the improvement as proposed.
   (E)   The Council considers the permit application. Within 60 days of
receiving the written recommendation from the Mayor, or his or her designee,
the Common Council shall hold a public hearing wherein it shall receive
information from the Mayor, or his or her designee, the applicant, and any
member of the public in favor of or opposed to the improvement. After the
closing of the public hearing, the Common Council may approve, deny, or
continue the consideration of the permit for a period of not more than 30 days.
The Common Council may also place reasonable restrictions on any permit. In
determining whether to approve or deny the permit, the Common Council shall
consider the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the applicant has proposed the least intrusive means of
constructing the proposed improvement;
      (2)   Whether the improvement as proposed endangers the public health,
safety, or general welfare of the community (and in particular those using or
living along the Midland Trace public recreational trail), and if so, how;
      (3)   Whether the applicant has taken reasonable measures to mitigate any
potential dangers to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the
community, and if so, what those measures are;
      (4)   Whether the applicant has considered the aesthetic impact of the
proposed improvement on the surrounding property, and particularly to that area
along, under, upon, and across the Midland Trace public recreational trail;
      (5)   Whether there are alternate means or locations to construct the
proposed improvement; and
      (6)   A cost benefit analysis weighing other alternatives to the proposed
improvement, if any, with the improvement as proposed.
   (F)   Violations. It shall be a violation of this section to construct any
improvement on a parcel of property that abuts the Midland Trace public
recreational trail, or that is within 600 feet from the boundary of the Midland
Trace public recreational trail (whichever distance is greater) without first
either: (1) complying with the SR 32 Overlay District; (2) obtaining an
improvement location permit; or (3) obtaining a permit under this section. For
the avoidance of any doubt, any public utility assets that are not owned and
operated by the city must first obtain a permit under this section before
constructing any improvement.
   (G)   Penalties. Any violation of this section shall be subject to the
following penalties:
      (1)   Anyone who violates any of the provisions of this section shall be
fined up to $2,500 per violation;
      (2)   Anyone who violates the terms of this section a subsequent time(s)
shall be fined up to $7,500. Each day of noncompliance with this section
(including making an improvement to property without a permit) shall be
considered a subsequent violation; and
      (3)   Anyone found by a court to have violated this section shall be
subject to, and responsible for the city's attorneys' fees, costs, and/or other
necessary expenses.

permits every year. The application for permit renewal must be submitted with
the proof of general liability insurance.
   (E)   Non-service encroachments shall be good for as long as the

         (b)   It is kept reasonably free of chipped, faded, peeling, and
cracked paint or rust and corrosion.
         (c)   The structural and functional parts of the permanent
encroachment are not broken or unduly misshapen.
      (2)   If the encroachment is deemed by the Designated Department as being
in a state of disrepair, the Designated Department shall notify the applicant
that the encroachment must be repaired or replaced within 60 days of receipt of
notice.
   (F)   Those service permanent encroachments in place prior to May 12,2010,
shall not be subject to the permit renewal requirements of this chapter.

the extent of the encroachment.
   (C)   Upon approval of a new permit application, the applicant shall be
required to submit to the Designated Department proof of insurance for general
liability within ten business days that states that the City of Noblesville,
Indiana is listed as an additional co-insured. An application for renewal shall
be submitted with proof of insurance for general liability. The minimum
insurance requirement shall be $1,000,000 per occurrence, $300,000 per person,
unless the Board of Public Works and Safety decides to increase such amounts.
The Board may find in certain situations a substantial risk of liability and at
their discretion may increase the required insurance amounts.
   (D)   An ADA clear zone of at least 48 inches must be maintained at all

safety and privacy of its citizens which includes the ability to protect

responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door to door solicitation,
the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by door to
door canvassing and solicitation as well as judicial decisions outlining the

procedures for the control and maintenance of the city rights-of-way.
   (B)   The city is responsible for maintaining all streets, roads, and
structures accepted within the city's rights-of-way and easements, and it is
therefore necessary to set minimum standards for the construction of all
improvements for which the city will be responsible in order to avoid assuming
unnecessary maintenance costs and inconvenience to the citizens and businesses
of the city.
   (C)   All improvements intended for public use, which are to be constructed
in a city right-of-way or easement must conform to the Noblesville Standards
and shall conform to or exceed the standards as set forth in this chapter.
   (D)   The standards set forth in this chapter are intended to be minimum
standards. Variances and/or waivers from these standards may be considered by
the Board of Public Works and Safety, the Board of Zoning Appeals, and/or the
Plan Commission and Council regarding planned developments when deemed
appropriate, upon written application to the said above noted city boards,
commission and/or Council citing unusual conditions justifying changes based
upon sound engineering practices. Proposed variances and/or waivers shall have
been reviewed by any applicable agency of jurisdiction and the Technical
Advisory Committee, before consideration by the Board of Public Works and
Safety, Board of Zoning Appeals, and/or Plan Commission and Council regarding a
planned development.

chapter shall contain such minimum data and information as listed on the

scheduled for such hearing or meeting unless filed, in proper form and number
and containing all required information, as per the applicable year’s adopted
meeting dates and filing deadline schedule which is adopted annually by the
body to which the application is made (i.e., Plan Commission and/or Board of
Zoning Appeals) and is available at the Planning Department or on the city’s
website. All applications shall follow the meetings dates as per the filing
deadline date. If for some unforeseen reason, the meeting dates following the
filing deadline date cannot be adhered to, those application shall then adhere
to the following month's filing deadline and meeting dates schedule.
         (b)   An application that does not require a public hearing shall be
filed, in proper form and number and containing all required information.
      (5)   Fees. Every application filed pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall be subject to an application and filing fee as established, from
time to time, by the Common Council. The owner of the property subject of the
application and, if different, the applicant shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of the fee. The failure to fully pay any such fee or
required deposit when due shall be grounds for refusing to process an
application and for denying or revoking any permit or approval sought or issued
with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid fee or required
deposit relates. A current fee schedule may be found in Appendix A of this
chapter.
      (6)   Special Requests. In addition to the minimum data and information
required pursuant to division (A)(3) of this section, every applicant shall
submit such other and additional data, information, or documentation as the
Director of Planning and Development or his or her designee or any board or
commission before which its application is pending may deem necessary or
appropriate to achieve a full and proper consideration and disposition of the
particular application.
      (7)   Dedication of Right-of-Way. All applications receiving final
approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals, Plan Commission, and/or Common
Council shall be required to dedicate all right-of-way for any and all streets,
adjacent to the property identified in the application, consistent with and
depicted on the Noblesville Thoroughfare Plan, as amended or the Hamilton
County Thoroughfare Plan, as amended. The dedication may appear on a plat
prepared by a licensed land surveyor or by a metes and bounds description and
drawing prepared by a licensed engineer/surveyor and shall be recorded within
30 days of the application approval and/or adoption. A recorded copy of said
dedication shall be submitted to the Noblesville Planning Department prior to
the issuance of any building permit. Failure to dedicate the required right-of-
way within the time period shall result in said application being null and
void.
      (8)   Waiver of Application Requirements. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this division (A), the Director of Planning and Development shall
have the authority to waive any requirement set forth in divisions (A)(1), (A)
(2), or (A)(3) of this section when, in his judgment, such waiver is
appropriate in light of the nature and extent of the relief being sought or in
light of special circumstances making compliance with those provisions either
unnecessary or unduly burdensome; provided, however, that any board or
commission before which such application may come shall continue to have the
right to request additional information pursuant to division (A)(3) of this
section and to delay processing of such application until such information is
provided and available in accordance with the deadlines established in division
(A)(4) of this section.
   (B)   Successive Applications.
      (1)   Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred. Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this chapter has been finally denied on its
merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or
not in the same form or on the same theory shall not be returned to the Board
of Zoning Appeals or the Plan Commission before one year has lapsed from the
date of denial unless in the opinion of the official, Board of Zoning Appeals,
or Plan Commission before which it was brought, there is substantial new
evidence available or an error or fact that significantly affected the prior
denial is discovered.
      (2)   New Grounds to Be Stated. Any such second application shall include
a detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such
application.
      (3)   Summary Denial With or Without Hearing. Any such second application
may be denied by the Director of Planning and Development summarily, and
without hearing, on a finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new
hearing. In any case where such application is set for hearing, the applicant
shall be required to establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits
of its application prior to being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits.
Unless such grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed
for such failure.
      (4)   Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second
application filed more than one year after the final denial of a prior
application shall be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Plan
Commission. The applicant shall, however, be required to place in the record
all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such
evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
   (C)   Public Hearings And Meetings.
      (1)   Setting Hearing or Meeting. When the provisions of this chapter
require a public hearing or public meeting in connection with any application
filed pursuant to this chapter, the official or body charged with conducting
the hearing or meeting shall, upon receipt of a properly completed application,
fix a reasonable time and place for such hearing or meeting.

§ 159.041 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to promote orderly growth
and development in the City of Noblesville and to insure that such development
is done in a manner harmonious with surrounding properties and consistent with
the general public welfare and with the policies in the Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Authority. The Technical Advisory Committee may, in accordance with
the procedures and standards set forth in this section and other regulations
applicable to the district in which the subject property is located, review and
make written recommendation with regard to any application requiring a site
plan.
   (C)   Site Plan Approval Required. Site plan review by the Technical
Advisory Committee in accordance with this section shall be required in the
following situations:
      (1)   In connection with any development or redevelopment for which this
chapter requires a Conditional Use Permit, Variance, Improvement Location
Permit, Subdivision Approval, and any Planned Development Approval.
      (2)   In connection with any redevelopment or minor modification
consisting of 35% of the market value of a premises, except for the initial
construction of a single- or two-family detached dwelling unit, or any
structure accessory thereto.
      (3)   In connection with any development, redevelopment or minor
modification in an Historic Preservation Overlay District.
   (D)   Procedure for Review and Recommendation.
      (1)   Pre-application Conference. Refer to §
159.046, Pre-filing Application Conference.
      (2)   Technical Advisory Committee Review.
         (a)   Application. Applications for a site plan review shall be filed
in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
         (b)   Action by Department of Planning and Development. Within seven
days after receipt by the Department of a properly completed application, the
Director of Planning and Development or his or her designee shall forthwith
transmit such application to the Technical Advisory Committee for hearing and
review.
         (c)   Public Meeting. The Technical Advisory Committee shall hold a
public meeting on the application in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040. The site plan, construction drawings (civil plans) and all other
required documentation shall be reviewed for conformity with this chapter and
all other applicable regulations.
         (d)   Action by Technical Advisory Committee. Each member of the
Technical Advisory Committee shall provide a written report and recommendation
either (i) endorsing the site plan as submitted; or (ii) endorsing it subject
to specific modifications; or (iii) not endorsing the site plan. The
endorsement of the Technical Advisory Committee shall then be forwarded to the
appropriate administrative body for final determination.
         (e)   A pre-construction meeting shall be held within six months from
the date of the Technical Advisory Committee meeting. Within 60 days of the
pre-construction meeting, erosion control installation, earthmoving, and
installation of infrastructure shall begin. Should the issuance of the ILP and
construction activity not begin within the above noted timeframes, the TAC
approvals shall lapse and become null and void thus requiring the re-submittal
of said plans including new filing fees, project plans, and application(s) and
other supplemental documents as required.
   (E)   Standards for Site Plan Review. The goals and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan or other applicable Noblesville planning documents shall be
utilized in the review of site plan applications. In addition, the Technical
Advisory Committee shall only recommend approval of the site plan submitted
pursuant to this division (E) on the basis of specific written findings
directed to one or more of the following standards:
      (1)   The arrangement of the structures on the site allow for the
effective use of the proposed development. Furthermore, such arrangement is
compatible with development on adjacent property and shall minimize potential
impact on the provision of municipal services and utilities.
      (2)   The arrangement of open space and landscape improvements on the
site create a desirable and functional environment for patrons, pedestrians,
and occupants. The arrangement preserves unique natural resources where
possible and respects desirable natural resources on adjacent sites.
      (3)   All circulation systems provide adequate and safe access to the
site and are compatible with public circulation systems minimizing potentially
dangerous traffic movements. Pedestrian and auto circulation are separated
insofar as practical. Site curb cuts have been minimized.
      (4)   Proposed parking areas or lots are designed, located and screened
to minimize adverse visual impacts on adjacent properties. Parking lot drainage
does not adversely affect neighboring properties. Perimeter parking lot
screening and internal landscaped islands have been utilized where feasible.
      (5)   Landscaping design shall create a logical transition to adjoining
lots and developments, screen incompatible uses, and minimize the visual impact
of parking lots on adjacent sites and roadways. Plant materials selected can
withstand the microclimate of the city.
      (6)   Site illumination has been designed, located and installed so as to
minimize adverse impacts to adjacent properties.
      (7)   Reasonable drainage or erosion solutions have been created which
properly integrates the site fully and satisfactorily into the overall existing
and planned drainage system serving the city.
   (F)   Additional Standards for Non-Residential Uses, Except in I-2 and I-3.
The city requires design review of all non-residential building construction
including new structures, additions to, alterations of, or modifications of any
existing structure or building, which is located within a non-residential
zoning district. The purpose of these design principles is to outline for the
benefit of applicant the expectations of the city regarding design and style of
development in all non-residential districts. These principles are intended to
provide a general understanding of the criteria applied to the design review
process. Each structure is considered unique and will be judged on the
following design principles.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   The architecture shall be of high quality, enduring, and
promoting a sense of character for the building street wall.
   Building walls shall reflect high-quality architecture and complement the
surrounding development(s). Building walls shall not be too simple or too
ornate and shall:
            1.   Provide those qualities in the environment which bring value
to the city;
            2.   Foster an attractiveness and functional utility of the city as
a place to live and work;
            3.   Preserve the character and quality of our heritage by
maintaining the integrity of those areas which have a discernible character;
            4.   Protect certain public investments in the local area;
            5.   Encourage a mix of uses and design;
            6.   Promote pedestrian accessibility and safety; and
            7.   Minimize visual clutter and blight.
         (b)   All new structures shall relate to the community's history,
culture, and/or geography. Time, place, and culture, work to create endless
variations on the themes of the city. Shape and form of a structure is
accomplished through architectural design. The following massing requirements
shall be incorporated in any proposed structure:
            1.   Building silhouette. Shall have similar pitch and scale to the
roofline of adjacent structures.
            2.   Spacing between the buildings. Shall include setbacks or
notches between the primary facades that frame the structure.
            3.   Setback from property line. Shall include setback area of
adjacent structures.
            4.   Proportion of windows and bays, doorways. Shall include
vertical and horizontal elements tied together in bands across the facade.
            5.   Proportion of facade. Shall be similar in area and height to
width ratios.
            6.   Location and treatment of entryway. Shall create a visual
commonality between structures.
            7.   Exterior materials. Shall include similar materials and
treatment of adjacent structures
            8.   Building scale. Shall include height and configuration
compatible with adjacent structures.
            9.   Landscaping. Shall tie the structure to the site and define
spaces.
            10.   Shadow patterns that form decorative features. Shall include
the light and dark surfaces from materials used and the projections from
windows, bays, etc., and recesses, and setbacks that create visual breaks.
            11.   360° architecture (refer to definition, §
159.016).
      (2)   Design principles. The design of the building should be kept simple
and materials and details should be consistent. Avoid a gaudy design.
         (a)   Avoid long, straight building shapes that are uninviting and do
not contribute positively to the streetscape.
         (b)   Detail shall be an integral part of the building design and use
consistently throughout.
         (c)   The exterior building design shall be coordinated on all
elevations with regard to color, materials, architectural form, and detailing
to achieve design harmony and continuity.
         (d)   Shadow patterns created by architectural elements such as
overhangs, projections, reveals, and awnings are strongly encouraged.
         (e)   Buildings shall be broken into a series of volumes that lessen
the volume and mass of the building by stepping back upper levels or
integrating projections and recesses into the design
         (f)   Structures located toward the front of the property serve to
visually narrow wide streets. Unifying the area with site amenities can lessen
the impact of the automobile and encourage pedestrian use.
         (g)   Protection of adjacent neighborhoods, in particular the location
of parking, driveways, outdoor lighting, trash bins, landscaping, signage,
development bulk standards, fencing, and the general character of the
surrounding development shall be considered when incorporating the
architectural design and materials.
      (3)   Relationships (architectural).
         (a)   New buildings shall respond to the existing streetscape. The
relative proportion of the building to its neighboring existing buildings and
pedestrians shall be maintained or enhanced when new buildings are built or
existing buildings are remodeled or altered.
         (b)   Buildings shall be designed to create interesting outdoor
spatial relationships.
         (c)   Production design common to restaurants, hotels/motels,
convenience markets, banks, etc. are strongly discouraged.
         (d)   The standard national franchise design is unacceptable and shall
be retrofitted to compliment the local character and surrounding community.
Architectural transplants from other communities are neither appropriate nor
desirable.
         (e)   Building heights, configurations, color, texture, and materials
shall be consistent among all buildings in a specific development and/or area.
         (f)   Building entries shall be accentuated with strong definition.
         (g)   Upgraded rear and side elevations, those exposed to public view,
shall have a level of quality and detail consistent with the front elevation of
the building.
         (h)   An identical design of at least one publicly exposed elevation
of the building cannot be repeated within a series of three buildings on either
side of the street. An identical building is one that an ordinary observer
would find the differences between the two elevations to be imperceptible when
viewing the elevations as a whole or unless instructed to detect the
differences, an ordinary observer would conclude that the two elevations are
the same.
         (i)   Building facades that are blank or windowless shall be
prohibited.
         (j)   Rooflines of existing structures or adjacent properties shall be
considered in the design to avoid clashes of materials and styles. The visual
continuity of roofs and their contributing elements such as parapet walls,
coping, cornices, etc., shall be maintained in the building development or
redevelopment.
         (k)   The roofline shall be designed in conjunction with the mass and
facade so that the building and its roof form a consistent composition.
         (l)   Roof penetrations shall be minimized by grouping plumbing vents
and ducts together.
         (m)   Sloped roof shall be a minimum of 6/12 pitch.
      (4)   Relationships (site).
         (a)   Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the
site. Natural features of the site, such as natural drainage ways, wooded or
forested areas, rock formations, etc. shall be preserved.
         (b)   On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take
advantage of the shade and energy conservation provided by the trees.
         (c)   The impression of the buildings tucked into, rather than
superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.
         (d)   The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas
shall be as important as the view available to the building occupants.
         (e)   Buildings shall be located according to the natural
characteristics of the site to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.
         (f)   Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing
topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.
         (g)   Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural
landforms.
      (5)   Materials and colors.
         (a)   Building colors should be compatible with the adjacent buildings
and neighborhood and shall reinforce the visual character of the area. The
color scheme shall be coordinated with the neighboring buildings and the city
as a whole. The intent is to unify the look of the buildings and/or area
without resorting to a "rubber stamp" type of approach.
         (b)   The color of the building shall not be such that the building is
competing for attention. Building colors shall be subdued and not "garish" and
shall not in any way become a "signing" of the building or site
         (c)   Integral coloring of the building materials is encouraged.
Differentiation of the color shall relate to the materials and/or the plane.
         (d)   The number of materials on the exterior building shall be
limited to prevent visual overload.
         (e)   Use of warm, muted, earth-tones shall be used on the body of the
building. More intense hues may be used as accent colors and for the
highlighting of architectural elements.
         (f)   Relate the paint colors to the natural material, colors found on
the building, such as brick, terra cotta, stone, tile, wood, or cast iron.
Brick and stone shall be left natural in all zoning districts except those
buildings located in the DT Downtown Zoning District that can be painted with
approval from the Director of Planning or his or her designee.
         (g)   Colors for building walls and storefronts shall be compatible
for the shops that occupy a multiple-storefront building. The use of different
colors to identify individual shops within a single structure is prohibited, as
it is visually disruptive and obscures the overall composition of the facade.
         (h)   Material samples and color samples for the buildings shall be
required to be submitted with the building permit application.
         (i)   Maximum number of colors on a single building is three.
         (j)   No blank walls are permitted for all building elevations. All
building elevations not facing a public right-of-way shall have a minimum of
20% of the walls having glazed areas or a glazed appearance.
         (k)   Storefronts shall consist of a maximum of 75% of the primary
facade.

§ 159.042 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. Conditional uses are those uses that, because of their
potential adverse impact upon the immediate neighborhood and the City, as a
whole, require a greater degree of scrutiny and review of site characteristics
and impacts to determine their suitability in a given location. As such, the
determination of conditional uses as appropriate shall be contingent upon their
meeting a set of specific standards and the weighing, in each case, of the
public need and benefit against the local impact, giving effect to the
proposals of the applicant for ameliorating adverse impacts through special
site planning and development techniques and contributions to the provisions of
public improvements, sites, right-of-way and services.
   (B)   Authority. The Board of Zoning Appeals may, in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in this section and other regulations
applicable to the district in which the subject property is located, approve by
ordinance, uses listed as conditional uses within each zoning district.
   (C)   Parties Entitled to Seek Conditional Use. An application for a
Conditional Use Permit may be filed with the Director of Planning and
Development or his or her designee by the owner or lessee of the subject
property or other person having a legal or equitable interest in the subject
property.
   (D)   Procedure for Review and Decision.
      (1)   Application. Applications for a Conditional Use Permit shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
      (2)   Action by Director of Planning and Development or his or her
designee.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a properly completed application for a
Conditional Use Permit, the Director of Planning and Development or his or her
designee shall forthwith transmit to the Technical Advisory Committee for its
review subject to §
159.041.
         (b)   The report and recommendations of the Technical Advisory
Committee shall be submitted in writing from the Director to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for its review.
      (3)   Public Hearing and Notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing on the application in accordance with the requirements of §
159.041. Notice for the public hearing shall be performed in the manner
prescribed by §
159.041.
      (4)   Action by Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall take action in accordance with IC 36-7-4 et seq., with particular
attention to the 900 series of said statute as the same may be amended.
      (5)   Judicial Review. Final decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals are
subject to judicial review as provided by applicable law. (See, e.g., IC 36-7-
4-1600 et seq.).
   (E)   Standards for Conditional Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed conditional use
in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing
that such use at the proposed location:
      (1)   Is in fact a conditional use established within the specific zoning
district involved;
      (2)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives or with any specific objective of the City's Comprehensive Plan and
this chapter;
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential character
of the same area;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services;
      (6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public expense
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      (7)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
      (8)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
      (9)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
   (F)   Supplementary Conditions And Safeguards. In granting any Conditional
Use Permit, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe conditions and
limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping,
screening, parking and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of
this chapter upon the premises benefited by a conditional use as may be
necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other
property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon
public facilities and services. However, such conditions shall not be used as a
device to authorize as a conditional use that which is intended to be temporary
in nature. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance
granting the Conditional Use Permit. Any conditions prescribed by the Board of
Zoning Appeals must be recorded by the applicant as a supplement to the deed
for the property, in the Hamilton County Recorder's office. Violation of any
such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit pursuant to §§
159.240 through
159.248 and
159.999
   (G)   No Presumption of Approval. The listing of a conditional use within
each zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such
conditional use will be approved. Rather, each proposed conditional use shall
be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to its compliance with the
standards and conditions set forth in §
159.041, and with the standards for the district in which it is located, in
order to determine whether approval of the conditional use is appropriate at
the particular location and in the particular manner proposed.
   (H)   Limitations on Conditional Uses.
      (1)   Subject to an extension of time granted by the Director of Planning
and Development, no Conditional Use Permit shall be valid for a period longer
than one year unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or
unless a certificate of occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that
period or unless a longer time is requested and granted by the Common Council.
      (2)   The approval of a proposed Conditional Use Permit by the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that
particular location for which the conditional use was issued.
      (3)   Except when otherwise provided in the ordinance for approving a
conditional use, a conditional use shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the
benefit of the use and lot in question, rather than the owner or operator of
such use or lot.
   (I)   Effect of Approval. The approval of a proposed Conditional Use Permit
by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall not authorize the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of
applications for such permits or approvals as may be required by the
regulations of the City, including but not limited to a building permit and a
certificate of occupancy.
   (J)   Amendment to Approved Conditional Use Development Plans. The holder of
an Improvement Location Permit for a conditional use may apply to the Board of
Zoning Appeals at any time for an alteration, change, amendment, or extension
of the Conditional Use of Development Plan upon which such permit was based.
      (1)   Upon receipt of such application, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
proceed as in the case of original applications for an Improvement Location
Permit for a conditional use.
      (2)   In the event the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve and order
such applications or Development Plan changed, altered, amended, or extended,
it shall notify the Director of Planning and Development who shall issue an
amended Improvement Location Permit accordingly.
      (3)   Any alteration, change or amendment to a site plan (previously
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals through the conditional use process)
and involving a new structure, combination of structures, or addition to an
existing structure, may be approved by the Director of Planning and
Development, who may issue an Improvement Location Permit without the
requirement of a public hearing or Board of Zoning Appeals approval provided
that:
         (a)   The net increase in floor area is less than 10,000 square feet
but not to exceed 50% of the gross floor area of structures on the parcel;
         (b)   That the plans for the proposed use be submitted to and reviewed
by the Technical Advisory Committee according to the schedule of filing
deadlines established by the Director of Planning and Development;
         (c)   That the plans be revised to incorporate any recommendations of
the Technical Advisory Committee that the Director of Planning and Development
deems appropriate; and
         (d)   That the property of the proposed use does not fall within 100
feet of the property line of an existing residential land use or platted
residential subdivision.
   (K)   Temporary Zoning Certificates for Staged Development. Whenever a
Conditional Use Permit has been approved and is of such a nature that the
applicant desires to complete the structures and improvements shown in the
Conditional Use Development Plan by stages, the applicant may make application
for a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy for any portion of the Plan that has
been completed.

§ 159.043 INTERPRETATIONS, APPEALS, AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Interpretations.
      (1)   Purpose. The interpretation authority established by division (A)
(4) of this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this
chapter, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address
every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such
situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific
provisions of this chapter in light of the general and specific purposes for
which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority
established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not
intended to add to or change the essential content of this chapter but is
intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific
cases.
      (2)   Authority. The Director of Planning and Development, subject to the
procedures, standards, and limitations of division (A)(4) of this section may,
by written order, render interpretations of the provisions of this chapter and
of any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it.
      (3)   Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations. Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest
in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation; provided that
interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical
circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an
advisory opinion.
      (4)   Procedure for Review and Decision.
         (a)   Application. Applications for interpretations of this chapter
shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
         (b)   Action on Application. Within ten working days following the
receipt of a properly completed application for interpretation, the Director of
Planning and Development shall inform the applicant in writing of his
interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon
which the determination is based. The failure of the Director of Planning and
Development to act within ten working days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the application
rendered on the day following such ten day period.
         (c)   Records. A record of all applications for interpretations shall
be kept on file in the office of the Director of Planning and Development. At
least once a year, the Director of Planning and Development shall make public a
listing of his decisions, by address, regarding the applications for
interpretation.
         (d)   Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Director of
Planning and Development may be taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant
to division (B)(4) of this section.
      (5)   Standards for Interpretations. The following standards shall govern
the Director of Planning and Development, and the Board of Zoning Appeals on
appeals from the Director of Planning and Development, in issuing
interpretations.
         (a)   Any use defined in §
159.016 shall be interpreted as therein defined;
         (b)   No interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with the
general district regulations established for that particular district;
         (c)   No interpretation shall permit any use in a district unless such
use is similar to other uses permitted in the district and is more similar to
those uses than to uses permitted in a more restrictive district;
         (d)   If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any
interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a
conditional use permit for such use pursuant to division (A)(2) of this
section; and
         (e)   No interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that
would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question.
      (6)   Effect of Favorable Interpretations. No interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or permitted as a conditional use in a
particular district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required
by the ordinances and ordinances of the City including, but not limited to, a
building permit, a certificate of occupancy, subdivision approval, and site
plan approval.
      (7)   Limitations on Interpretations.
         (a)   Subject to an extension of time granted by the Director of
Planning and Development, no interpretation shall be valid for a period longer
than 12 months from the date of issue.
         (b)   An interpretation finding a use to be permitted, or permitted as
a conditional use in a particular district, shall be deemed to authorize only
the particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed
to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation
has not been issued.
   (B)   Appeals.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against
arbitrary, ill-considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is
intended to avoid the need for legal action by establishing local procedures to
review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a
means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intent of this chapter or the
rightful authority of the Director of Planning and Development to enforce the
requirements of this chapter. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all
proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this
chapter and to the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged
with the administration of this chapter.
         (b)   The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Director of Planning and
Development certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of
appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would cause, in his opinion, imminent peril to life or property, in which
case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
that may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record, on
application, of notice to the Director of Planning and Development and on due
cause shown.
         (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order or final decision as in its opinion ought to be
made in the premises, and to that end has all the powers of the officer from
whom the appeal is taken.
      (2)   Authority. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to
act, of the Director of Planning and Development acting pursuant to his or her
authority and duties under this chapter and to that end the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall have the same powers and be subject to the same standards and
limitations as the Director of Planning and Development with respect to any
order, decision, or determination being appealed.
      (3)   Parties Entitled to Appeal. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals
concerning the interpretation or administration of this chapter may be taken by
any persons aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of the legislative authority
of the city affected by any decision of the Director of Planning and
Development.
      (4)   Procedure.
         (a)   Application. An application for appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be filed not later than 45 days after the action being appealed
and shall be in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
         (b)   Action by Director of Planning and Development. Upon receipt of
a properly completed application for an appeal, the Director of Planning and
Development shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals the
application together with all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
         (c)   Public Hearing and Notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
hold a public hearing on the application in accordance with the requirements of
§
159.040. Notice for the public hearing shall be provided in the manner
prescribed by §
159.040.
         (d)   Action by Board of Zoning Appeals. Within 30 days after the
close of the public meeting, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a written
decision on the appeal. Such decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole
or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or
determination as, in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, is proper to
be made in the premises. The failure of the Board of Zoning Appeals to act
within such 30 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree,
shall be deemed to be a decision denying the appeal.
         (e)   Review by Certiorari. Every decision by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be subject to review by certiorari. Any person aggrieved by a
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may present to the Circuit Court of
Hamilton County a petition duly verified setting forth that such decision is
illegal in whole or in part and specifying the grounds of the illegality. The
petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the entry of the
decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (5)   Right to Grant Variance in Deciding Appeals. In any case where the
application for appeal is accompanied by an application for a variance in
accordance with §
159.043(C)(4), the Board of Zoning Appeals shall notice, hear, decide to grant
or deny, such variance in compliance with the provisions of §
159.043(C)(4).
      (6)   Conditions and Limitations on Rights Granted by Appeal. In any case
where this chapter imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such
right granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals on appeal shall be subject to such
conditions and limitations in the same manner and to the same extent as if
secured without the necessity of an appeal.
   (C)   Variances.
      (1)   Purpose. The variance procedures are intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen particular
applications of this chapter that create unnecessary hardships. When such
hardships may be more appropriately remedied, if at all, pursuant to other
provisions of this chapter, the variance procedure is inappropriate.
      (2)   Authority.
         (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon application in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in serious practical
difficulty. No non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district and no permitted or non-conforming use of lands,
structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted solely on the grounds of
convenience or profit; however, where strict application of the provisions of
this chapter would result in serious practical difficulty, convenience or
profit may be considered as a relevant factor in the Board decision.
         (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may consider issuing a variance from
the terms and provisions of the Flood Hazard (FH) District provided the
structure for which a variance is requested existed at the time of the
effective date of this chapter, and provided the applicant offers that the
grant of the requested variance will not increase flood heights, create
additional threats to public safety, cause additional public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing
laws or ordinances.
         (c)   In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider land use
variances in cases in which a proposed use for a property does not fall within
the list of permitted or conditional uses for the zone district in which it is
located.
      (3)   Parties Entitled to Seek Variance. An application for a variance
may be filed with the Director of Planning and Development by the owner or
lessee of the subject property or other person having a legal or equitable
interest in the subject property.
      (4)   Procedure for Review and Decision.
         (a)   Application. Applications for a variance shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
         (b)   Action by Director of Planning and Development.
            1.   Upon receipt of a properly completed application for a
Conditional Use Permit Variance, the Director of Planning and Development shall
forthwith transmit it to the Technical Advisory Committee for its review
subject to §
159.041 if construction drawings of sufficient detail are provided.
            2.   The report and recommendations of the Technical Advisory
Committee shall be submitted in writing from the Director to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for its review if Technical Advisory Committee review is
completed on a pending application.
         (c)   Public Hearing and Notice. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
hold a public hearing on the application in accordance with the requirements of
§
159.040. Notice for the public hearing shall be provided in the manner
prescribed by §
159.040.
         (d)   Action by Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall
take action in accordance with IC 36-7-4 et seq., with particular attention to
the 900 series of said statute as the same may be amended.
         (e)   Review by Certiorari. Every decision by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be subject to review by certiorari. Any person aggrieved by a
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may present to the Circuit Court of
Hamilton County a petition duly verified setting forth that such decision is
illegal in whole or in part and specifying the grounds of the illegality. The
petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the entry of the
decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (5)   Findings of Fact for Variances.
         (a)   Findings of Fact.
            1.   Every application for a variance shall be subject to the
findings of fact as set out in I.C. 36-7-4-918.5 et seq. A variance from the
terms of this chapter shall not be granted unless the Board of Zoning Appeals
makes specific written findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented in the application materials and at the hearing which
support conclusions that all of the standards and conditions imposed by
recommendation of the Director of Planning and Development and the Technical
Advisory Committee have been met. A Development Standards Variance may be
approved only upon a determination in writing that:
               A.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;
               B.   The use arid value of the area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner; and
               C.   The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance
will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.
            2.   In addition to the findings of fact, the Board should consider
the following factors when deliberating over a variance request:
               A.   Hardship. No variance shall be granted pursuant to this
unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict letter of the
provision's of this chapter would create a particular hardship or practical
difficulty. The hardship in the FH zoning district must be exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or disagreement with the neighbors
also does not qualify as an exceptional hardship as they can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is
more expensive. The need for a property owner to build elsewhere or put the
property to a different use than originally intended does not constitute a
hardship.
               B.   Unique physical condition. The subject lot is exceptional
as compared to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of a unique
physical condition, including presence of an existing use, structure, or sign,
whether conforming or non-conforming; irregular or substandard shape or size;
exceptional topographical features; or other extraordinary physical conditions
peculiar to and inherent in the subject lot that amount to more than a mere
inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot rather
than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot.
               C.   Not self-created. The aforesaid unique physical condition
is not the result of any action or inaction of the owner or its predecessors in
title and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a
variance is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of
governmental action, other than the adoption of this chapter.
               D.   Denied substantial rights. The carrying out of the strict
letter of the provision from which variance is sought would deprive the owner
of the subject lot of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other
lots subject to the same provision.
               E.   Not merely special privilege. The alleged hardship or
difficulty is neither merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy
some special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants
of other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely the inability of the
owner to make more money from the use of the subject lot.
               F.   Ordinance and plan purposes. The variance would not result
in a use or development of the subject lot that would not be in harmony with
the general and specific purposes for which this chapter and the provision from
which a variance is sought were enacted or the general purpose and intent of
the Comprehensive Plan.
               G.   No other remedy. There is no means other than the requested
variance by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied
to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject lot.
               H.   Minimum required. The requested variance is the minimum
measure of relief necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship or difficulty
presented by the strict application of the ordinance.
         (b)   Additional Considerations for Flood Hazard Areas. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall, in weighing the appropriateness of a variance for Flood
Hazard areas, consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, as well as the
following:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            9.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment of transport of floodwaters at the site.
            10.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
         (c)   Every application for a land use variance shall be subject to
the findings of fact as set out in I.C. 36-7-4-918.4 et seq. A variance from
the land use of this chapter shall not be granted unless the Board of Zoning
Appeals makes specific written findings of fact based directly on the
particular evidence presented in the application materials and at the hearing
which support conclusions that all of the standards and conditions imposed by
recommendation of the Director of Planning and Development and the Technical
Advisory Committee have been met. A land use variance may be approved only upon
a determination in writing that:
            1.   the approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;
            2.   the use and value of the area adjacent to the property
included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner;
            3.   the need for the variances arises from some condition peculiar
to the property involved;
            4.   the strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance
will constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which
the variance is sought; and
            5.   the approval does not interfere substantially with the
comprehensive plan.
   (F)   Supplemental Requirements for Variances in Flood Hazard Areas.
      (1)   Variances from the provisions of the Flood Hazard zoning district
shall only be granted when the Board can make positive findings of fact based
on evidence submitted at the hearing for the following:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination of failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined in §
159.016.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance for non-residential uses granted in a floodway will
require prior approval of a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would

said amendment.
   (D)   Standards for Amendments. The wisdom of amending the text of this
chapter or the Zoning Map is a matter committed to the sound legislative
discretion of the Common Council and is not controlled by any one standard. In
making their determination, however, the Common Council should, in determining
whether to adopt or deny, or to adopt some modification of the Plan
Commission's recommendation, consider, among other factors, the following:
      (1)   Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the goals,
objectives, and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, as adopted and amended from
time to time by the Common Council;
      (2)   Whether the proposed amendment is compatible with current
conditions and the overall character of existing development in the immediate
vicinity of the subject property;
      (3)   Whether the proposed amendment is the most desirable use for which
the land in the subject property is adapted;
      (4)   Whether the proposed amendment will have an adverse effect on the
value of properties throughout the jurisdiction; and

reject the recommendation of the Plan Commission or adopt some modification of
the recommendation of the Plan Commission. Failure of the legislative body to
pass the proposed amendment within 90 days after its rejection by the Plan
Commission constitutes rejection of the proposed amendment; and the proposed
amendment may not be reconsidered by the Plan Commission or legislative body
until the expiration of one year after the date of its original rejection by
the Plan Commission.

location permit, conditional use permit, variance permit, building permit, or
other permit must be commenced within six months of the date of issuance of
such permit(s), otherwise the same shall lapse and be and become null and void.
All work so authorized shall be completed within 24 months from the issuance of
the permit therefor, and if for good cause shown the Director of Planning and
Development may extend the work completion time as per §
159.041(H).
      (6)   Issuance of certificate of occupancy. Certificates of occupancy may
be issued by the Director of Planning and Development within ten days after
notification by the applicant that the lawful erection, reconstruction, or
structural alteration of such building or other improvement of the land shall
have been completed and the finding of the Director that such erection,
reconstruction, or structural alteration is complete and all required
inspections were approved including those required by the Building, Planning,
Engineering, MS4 Division, GIS, and other departments as may be required.
      (7)   Enforcement. In case any building, structure, or property is, or is
intended to be erected constructed, reconstructed, altered or converted, or any
building, structure, or property is, or is intended to be used in violation of,
or contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the Director of Planning and
Development is hereby authorized, in addition to other remedies set forth in
the Statutes of the State of Indiana and in this chapter, to institute an
action to enjoin, or any other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such
erection, construction, alteration, conversion, or use.
      (8)   Sewage disposal. An application for an improvement location permit
for any use shall not be approved until it has been ascertained by the Director
of Planning and Development or his or her designee that the proposed use and
minimum lot size and width meet the minimum standards for a sewage disposal
system as required by the Hamilton County Health Department, the Noblesville
Board of Public Works and Safety, other licensed centralized waste collection
entities of appropriate jurisdiction, and as otherwise required by this
chapter.
      (9)   Temporary certificate of occupancy. When the improvement covered by
the issued permit has been completed in substantial conformity with the
architectural plan, site plan and/or development plan submitted with the
application, a temporary certificate of occupancy may then be issued. For non-
residential structures, the temporary certificate of occupancy shall permit the
stocking, shelving, furniture installation and similar activities but not the
utilization of the building for general public use or the term "Open for
Business." For residential structures, a temporary certificate of occupancy
does permit the occupying of the structure in most instances. All temporary
certificates of occupancy are valid for a period not exceeding 30 days except
as otherwise noted in this chapter. At the end of the 30 days, all unfinished
items shall be completed and re-inspected for total compliance with the issued
permit and submitted plans. The Director of Planning and Development may grant
a one-time extension not exceeding 30 days for unusual or unique circumstances.
      (10)   Final certificate of occupancy. For commercial projects, no FINAL
certificate of occupancy will be issued to occupy the structure until such time
the GIS submittal (as-built infrastructure), per the Noblesville GIS
requirements, has been submitted and approved and all building and site
conditions have been inspected and approved as per the issued permit. The above
applies to the overall residential subdivision and/or planned development and
not individual lots. In addition, for commercial projects, the Fire Department
GIS submittal of “as-built building plans” per the specifications shall be
submitted and accepted.
      (11)   Records of certificate of occupancy. Every certificate of
occupancy issued pursuant to division (C) of this section shall be kept on file
in the Office of the Director of Planning and Development and shall be a public
record.
   (D)   Demolition permits.
      (1)   Scope. A demolition permit shall be obtained prior to a structure
being removed and/or destroyed to the ground.
      (2)   Application for a demolition permit. An application for a
demolition permit shall include:
         (a)   A completed application for a building permit signed by all
owners of the property;
         (b)   A single copy of a sketch plan drawing (informal) or aerial
photographs, including the general locations of all existing structures on the
real estate, highlighting or identifying the structure(s) to be removed;
         (c)   A written statement as to the removal of the demolished
materials and the intended use of the area [the place where the demolished
materials are being located (hauled)];
         (d)   A signed copy of the "Demolition Permit Requirements
Application" concerning the existing well, septic systems, sanitary sewer, and/
or fuel tanks.
         (e)   Written proof of disconnection from utilities such as gas,
water, and/or electric.
         (f)   If a structure is to be rebuilt in its place, a sketch plan

      (3)   Application for demolition within the Downtown Protection Boundary.
In addition to the information required in division (D)(2) above, all
structures larger than 400 square feet to be demolished within the demolition
area defined as the “Downtown Protection Area”, which is generally depicted in
Appendix I of this chapter, shall be presented to the Plan Commission for a
certificate of authorization, and to the Common Council for approval of the
certificate of authorization. The Downtown Protection Area is more particularly
defined as the area within the following boundaries: beginning at the
intersection of the north-south alley between 11th and 10th Streets and
Harrison Street, continuing in a westerly direction to White River, thence
south to Maple Avenue, thence east to 6th Street, continuing south along 6th
Street to Cherry Street, thence westerly to 6th Street, continuing south along
6th Street to Hannibal Street, thence easterly to 7th Street, thence south to
Division Street, thence continuing easterly along Division Street to 11th
Street, thence north to the east-west alley between Conner Street and Maple
Avenue, thence continuing in an easterly direction to 17th Street, thence
continuing in a northerly direction to the east-west alley between Logan and
Conner Streets, thence continuing in a westerly direction to the north-south
alley between 10th and 11th Streets, thence continuing in a northerly direction
along the north-south alley between 10th and 11th Streets to the place of
beginning. For any demolition of a structure larger than 400 square feet within
the Downtown Protection Area, the following process shall apply:
         (a)   The presentation to the Plan Commission of the request for
demolition of a structure more than 400 square feet in size within the above-
described boundary shall be scheduled upon the submission of a complete
application. The application will be considered at the next meeting of the Plan
Commission, upon which the applicant may comply with the applicable notice
requirements.
         (b)   Within the described Downtown Protection Boundary, there is an
area where preservation of the existing facades that contribute to the historic
character of our community is of utmost importance, shown in Exhibit (D)(3)(b)
below. Demolition of a structure within the area highlighted in Exhibit (D)(3)
(b) shall only occur if all of the following apply:
            1.   No means of construction exists that allows the facades of the
existing structures to remain through integration into new construction;
            2.   Irreparable damage has occurred to the facade to an extent
that cannot be fixed in a fiscally reasonable manner; and
            3.   The proposed new structure incorporates architectural styles
and elements identified in the original application for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places that may be found in the National Archives
Catalogue. The architectural styles and elements must be listed in these
documents as contributing to the overall character of the district, and shall
be used in structures surrounding the proposed new construction.
            The above-referenced criteria in division (D)(3)(b)1. and 2. above
shall not be applicable to any structure that is highlighted within Exhibit (D)
(3)(b) as a non-contributing structure. However, any new structure shall be
subject to division (D)(3)(b)3. above. Non-contributing-structure information
was taken from the original application for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places.
   Exhibit (D)(3)(b)

IMAGES/0-0-0-7773.png]
 
         (c)    The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing and determine
whether a certificate of authorization shall be issued. The Plan Commission
shall consider the following factors:
            1.    Is the existing structure an imminent threat to public health
and safety?
            2.   Does the proposed demolition serve a greater public purpose?
            3.   Is the structure proposed for demolition a historic landmark
or a building within a historic district that contributes to the district
character?
            4.   Does the proposed new construction on the site of the
demolition fit the established or intended character of the area?
         (d)   When the applicant or property owner cannot establish the need
for demolition under the findings above, the Plan Commission may, when
requested by the property owner, consider evidence of the economic impact on
the owner of the denial of the certificate. A certificate may not be denied if
it is established that the denial will deprive the owner of any reasonable
economic use of the structure, and there is no viable or reasonable alternative
that would have less impact on the features of significance.
            To prove the existence of a condition of unreasonable economic
return, the applicant must establish, and the Plan Commission must find in the
affirmative one of the following conditions:
            1.   No economically viable use of the property exists;
            2.   The cost to repair the structure exceeds the fair market value
of the property;
            3.   The property is not marketable or able to be sold when listed
for sale or lease.
         (e)   If rehabilitation or restoration are feasible and the structure
is not an imminent threat to the public health or safety, a citizen or
community organization may request the Plan Commission place a 90-day hold on
the forwarding of a recommendation on a certificate of authorization to provide
the person or the group with an opportunity to identify and evaluate
alternatives to demolition. If at the end of the 90-day hold no alternatives to
demolition have been established, the Plan Commission shall issue a certificate
of authorization to the applicant.
         (f)   Once the certificate of authorization is issued, the matter
shall be heard by the Common Council for approval at its next regular meeting.
In its approval or denial of the certification of authorization, the Common
Council may consider only the application, the Planning Department staff
report, and the information before the Plan Commission at the public hearing.
The Common Council’s approval shall serve as affirmation of the finding of the
Plan Commission. The Planning Department may issue a demolition permit only
upon receipt of the certification of authorization and Common Council approval.
      (4)   Exemptions. This chapter does not apply to a demolition associated
with a project that has an executed resolution for an economic development
agreement. However, the factors listed in this chapter will be considered in
relation to those projects.
      (5)   Appeals. Denial of a permit under this division is considered a
final decision and may be appealed pursuant to state law.
   (E)   Sexually Oriented Business Uses.
      (1)   No sexually oriented business as regulated by §
159.130 shall be permitted to operate without obtaining a sexually oriented
improvement location permit. This permit shall be required separately from
other permits as required by the city.
      (2)   Applications for Improvement Location Permits shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of §§
159.040 -
159.045. Sexually Oriented Improvement Location Permit Applications must
include the following:
         (a)   A sketch or diagram showing the configuration of the premises,
including a statement of total floor space occupied by the business. The sketch
or diagram need not be professionally prepared, but it must be drawn to a
designated scale or drawn with marked dimensions of the interior of the
premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six inches. The sketch must also
address the specific requirements of the business for which the permit
application is for, as outlined by the Classification Specific Design
Requirements.
         (b)   A current certificate and straight-line drawing prepared within
30 days prior to application prepared by a State of Indiana registered land
surveyor depicting the property lines and the structures containing any
established existing uses regulated by this chapter within 1,000 feet of the
property to be certified; the property lines of any established protected use
within 1,000 feet of the property to be certified; and the property lines of
any residentially zoned area or residential property within 1,000 feet of the
property to be certified, if not apparent. For purposes of this section, a use
shall be considered existing or established if it is in existence at the time
an application is submitted.
   (F)   Other permits issued by Department of Planning and Development.
Permits or registrations shall be required for the following uses pursuant to
the procedures and standards in §§
159.120 through
159.129;
      (1)   Accessory Uses and Structures.
      (2)   Home Occupations.
      (3)   Residential Care Homes.
      (4)   Temporary Uses.

SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE
§ 159.060 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Applicability. The subdivision procedure described in this subchapter
shall be required for the subdivision or resubdivision of any tract of land
and/or the dedication of right-of-way within the planning jurisdiction of the
city.
   (B)   General Procedure. Before any land is subdivided the owner of the
property proposed to be subdivided, or his authorized agent, shall apply for
and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the
following three-step procedure:
      (1)   A Minor Subdivision Plat shall be submitted to and reviewed by the
Director of Planning and Development or his or her designee, reviewed and
approved by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), prepared on Mylar and
signed by the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission, and submitted to
the Board of Public Works or the Hamilton County Commissioner’s for acceptance,
depending on jurisdiction, and recorded in the Hamilton County Recorder’s
Office.
      (2)   A primary plat shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Director
of Planning and Development or his or her designee, reviewed by the Technical
Advisory Committee, and reviewed and approved by the Plan Commission in a
public hearing.
      (3)   A secondary subdivision plat or a replat of a subdivision shall be
submitted to and approved by the Director of Planning and Development or his or
her designee, reviewed and approved by the Technical Advisory Committee, signed
by the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission, signed by either the
Board of Public Works or the County Commissioners depending on jurisdiction and
filed with the Hamilton County Recorder.
   (C)   General Restrictions.
      (1)   The following actions may occur once the secondary plat has been
signed, regardless of whether the plat has been recorded:
         (a)   The granting of an Improvement Location Permit, or the
construction of any public improvements authorized thereby provided appropriate
performance bonds have been posted and all required pre-construction meeting(s)
have been held with the public works agency of jurisdiction;
         (b)   Contracts made for the sale of any part of the subdivision;
         (c)   Improvements or building on any individual lot.
      (2)   No building permit shall be issued until the plat has been
recorded.
      (3)   No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any
building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation
of the provisions of this subchapter.
   (D)   Resubdivisions (replats).
      (1)   For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision
plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area
reserved thereon for public use, or if it affects any map or plan legally
recorded prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivision, such
change shall be approved by the Plan Commission by the same procedure, rules,
and regulations as for a subdivision.
      (2)   Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat
shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided, the Plan Commission
may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets
and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. As a requirement of the plat,
dedications of rights-of-way shall be provided for the future opening and
extension of the streets.
   (E)   Waivers to Subdivision Standards.
      (1)   Waivers to subdivision standards found in this chapter shall not be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, but may be granted by the Plan
Commission subject to the applicable requirements herein. It is not within the
jurisdiction of the Board of Zoning Appeals to grant waivers to subdivision
regulations.
      (2)   It is the intention of this chapter that all newly created lots
conform to the provisions of this chapter for lot area and width. Variances to
these or other zoning standards may be granted subject to the provisions of §
159.043(C) - Variances or may be obtained through flexible zoning districts
such as the Zero Lot Line (ZLL) or Planned Development (PD) Overlay Districts.
It is not within the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission to grant variances to
zoning regulations.
      (3)   Where the Plan Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with the subdivision
regulations of §§
159.060 through
159.087, or if the purposes of these regulations may be better served by an
alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to said regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
such waivers shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations; and further provided the Plan Commission shall not approve
waivers unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
         (a)   The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property.
         (b)   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are
unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not applicable
generally to other properties.
         (c)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out. Financial hardship
does not constitute grounds for a waiver.
         (d)   The waiver will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Comprehensive Master Plan or this Unified Development Ordinance.
         (e)   Where the waiver impacts on the design and construction of
public facilities; all appropriate public agencies will be given ample time to
comment in writing to the Commission.
      (4)   In approving waivers, the Plan Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
      (5)   A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in writing by the

         (e)   The presence or absence of any protective covenants for the
subdivision which would alter its impact from what would typically be permitted
in the zoning district in which it is located; as evidenced by the inclusion of
any covenants in the primary plat application.
      (4)   Effective Period of Primary Plat Approval. An approved primary plat
application shall be effective for a period of one year, at the end of which
time a secondary plat of the proposed subdivision must have been approved and
signed by the President and Secretary of the Commission. The following words

homes in a subdivision, the Commission may permit a portion of a subdivision
involving one or more lots to be sectionalized from the primary plat pursuant
to this section, provided that said portion derives access from an existing
public street, that the lots are clustered together near the entrance of the
subdivision, and that no future road or other improvement are anticipated where
said lots are proposed.
         (b)   A secondary plat for the model home lots shall be submitted to
the Commission simultaneously with the primary plat for the subdivision.
Subsequent to the approval of both of said plats, and the recording of the
model home secondary plat, the model home(s) may be constructed subject to the
additional requirements that the Commission may require.

considered a separate secondary plat with respect to the following:
            1.   The Commission may require the completion of improvements
located only in the section(s) of plat for which a secondary plat application
has been submitted, and allow the subdivider to defer completing improvements
in the remaining sections of the plat until a secondary plat application has
been submitted for those sections.
            2.   The Commission may require the performance bond or other
security be in an amount commensurate with the section(s) of the plat for which
a secondary plat application has been submitted, and the subdivider may defer
posting a performance bond or other surety for the remaining sections of the
plat until a secondary plat application has been submitted for those sections.
            3.   The subdivider may file irrevocable offers to dedicate streets
and public improvements in the section(s) of the plat for which a secondary
plat application has been submitted, and defer filing offers of dedications for
the remaining sections of the plat until a secondary plat application has been
submitted for those sections.
            4.   Only sections for which the secondary plat applications have
been approved, subject to this section, shall be filed with the Hamilton County
Recorder.
         (c)   The Commission may also impose any conditions upon the filing of
secondary plat applications for said sections to assure the orderly development
of the subdivision. This may including requiring the completion of improvement
necessary to the overall subdivision but not located within the current section
of secondary plat, or the posting of a bond or other security in lieu thereof,
and the required dedication of such improvements.

appropriate boards, commission, agencies, and offices of the city or county.
      (3)   Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity
with the above laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies, the regulations of
this subchapter, or the purposes of these regulations as established in this
chapter.
   (C)   Political and Jurisdictional Boundaries. To eliminate potential
jurisdictional disputes and to facilitate effective coordination and control of
development, the Plan Commission shall be guided by the following policy:
      (1)   Whenever access to the development is required across land in
another local government, the Commission shall request assurance from that
local governmental attorney that access is legally established, and from the
local governmental engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or
that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to
assure the construction of the access road.
      (2)   Lot lines shall be laid out so as not to cross boundary lines
between adjacent units of local government which has separate governing bodies
for the purpose of regulation and control of land use and development, as well
as for tax purposes.
   (D)   Conditions of Development.
      (1)   Character of Land Suitable for Development. Land that the Plan
Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to
flooding, improper drainage, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
development and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed
unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission, upon recommendation of the Technical Advisory Committee,
to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. The land shall
be set aside for uses as shall not involve any danger to public health, safety,
and welfare.
      (2)   Adequate Public Facilities. No primary plat shall be approved
unless the Planning Commission determines that public facilities will be
adequate to support and service the area of the proposed development. The
applicant shall, at the request of the Planning Commission, submit sufficient
information and data on the proposed development to demonstrate the expected
impact on and use of public facilities by possible uses of said development.
Public facilities and services to be examined for adequacy will include roads,
sewerage, schools, and public safety agencies.
      (3)   Reservation of Land for Public Use.
         (a)   Where a proposed park or other public use is shown on an
Official Plan of the city, and said public use is located in whole or in part
within a proposed development, sufficient area for the public use shall be
dedicated to the public or reserved and offered for public purchase. If within
five years of plat recording the purchase is not agree on, the reservation
shall be terminated. Space for public uses which is improved per public
standards may count towards applicable impact fee requirements.
         (b)   Where it is deemed essential by the Plan Commission, upon
consideration of the particular type of development proposed in the
development, the needs for public services that the development will generate,
and the policies of the Comprehensive Master Plan, the Commission may recommend
and the Common Council may require the reservation of land for public use. Land
required for dedication shall be of a location, size, and character consistent
with the needs created by the development. Land for public uses which is
improved per public standards may count towards applicable impact fee
requirements.
      (4)   Extension Policies. All public improvements and required easements
shall be extended through the parcel on which new development is proposed.
Streets, water lines, wastewater systems, drainage facilities, electric lines,
and telecommunications lines shall be constructed through new development to
promote the logical extension of public infrastructure. The city may require
the applicant of a development to extend off-site improvements to reach the
development or oversize required public facilities to serve anticipated future
development as a condition of plat approval. The cost of such extensions or
oversizing shall be borne by the developer unless other provision has been made
to cover the cost via impact fee ordinances.
   (E)   Required Improvements. The following public and other improvements
shall generally be provided in new developments and, when provided, shall be
designed and installed in accordance with the conditions and specifications in

§ 159.076 MONUMENTS.
   (A)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Monuments shall be placed for the purpose of delineating each
individual lot boundaries, the external boundaries of a subdivision plat and
the centerline of roadways.
      (2)   Monuments shall be installed after final grading is completed. Each
property corner and internal angle point shall be monumented by the
installation of a two foot by six inch long iron rod, capped flush at final
grade with a durable plastic cover.
      (3)   A land surveyor, registered in the State of Indiana, shall attest
to the accuracy of the installed individual lot monuments. Certified Statements
of Attestment shall be submitted to the Noblesville Department of Engineering
after the Plan Commission has approved the plat but prior to the issuance of
any building permits.
      (4)   Monuments which are damaged or altered shall be reset by party
responsible for damage/alteration. If a responsible party cannot be readily
determined, the developer shall bear the costs of having the monument(s) reset.
      (5)   All monuments including external boundaries, water bodies, and
individual lots shall be installed and inspected/accepted by the city.
Monumentation for individual lots is required as a part of the final
certificate of occupancy approval.
   (B)   External Boundaries.
      (1)   Type of Monument. The external boundaries of a development shall be
monumented in the field by monuments of concrete, not less than 30 inches in
length, not less than four inches square and marked on top with a cross, brass
plug, or iron rod.
      (2)   Location of Monument. These monuments shall be placed not more than
1,320 feet apart in any straight line and at points of tangency, points of
curvature, and intersection of another roadway and those points to be not less
than 20 feet back from the bank of any water body, except that when such
corners or points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the
monuments shall be placed in the side line of the street.
      (3)   Guarantee of Accuracy. A land surveyor, registered in the State of
Indiana, shall attest to the accuracy of the installed monuments. Certified
statements of attestment shall be submitted to the Department of Engineering
for consideration and acceptance of the roadway by the Noblesville Board of
Public Works and Safety.
      (4)   Damaged Monuments. Monuments which are damaged or altered shall be
reset by party responsible for damage/alteration. If a responsible party cannot
be readily determined, the developer shall bear the costs of having the
monument(s) reset.
   (C)   Internal Boundaries. All internal boundaries and those corners and
points not covered by the preceding division shall be monumented in the field
on iron rods one-half inch in diameter and 30 inches long. These monuments
shall be placed at all block and lot corners and at all internal angle points
as required by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Monuments Marking Water Bodies. The lines of lots that extend to
bodies of water shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least 30
inches long and seven-eighths inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars

§ 159.077 DEVELOPMENT BLOCK AND LOT LAYOUT.
   (A)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth pursuant to Table 8.B. Summary of Residential Bulk
Requirements (see Table 5, §
159.106), Table 8.C. Summary of Commercial Bulk Requirements (see Table 6, §
159.107), Table 8.D. Summary of Industrial Bulk Standards (see Table 7, §
159.108), Table 8.E.4. Bulk Requirement for Corporate Campus Non-Residential
Subdistricts (see §
159.107) and Table 8.F.4. Bulk Requirements for Federal Hill Subdistricts (see
§
159.109). Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be permitted in blocks
adjacent to major transportation facilities, water courses, and industrial and
commercial areas.
      (2)   The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be appropriate for the
location and the type of development contemplated, but shall follow the
restrictions and guidelines below:
         (a)   Blocks, on local streets, in residential areas shall not be more
than 1,000 feet nor less than 400 feet in length.
         (b)   Wherever practical, blocks along major arterials and collector
streets should be a minimum of 1,000 feet in length.
         (c)   Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and
width as may be determined suitable by the Planning Commission for the
prospective use.
      (3)   In long blocks, the Plan Commission may require an easement through
the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or pedestrian walkways
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities.
      (4)   Where blocks are developed along arterial streets and/or highways
that shall contain alleys, those alleys shall run parallel to said arterial and
not perpendicular or radial to it so as to create an intersection between the
arterial and alley.
   (B)   Lots.
      (1)   Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangements shall be such that there will
be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions,
in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
ordinance and other regulations, in providing safe driveway access to buildings
on such lots from an approved street, or in providing service to public
sanitary sewer or approved sanitary disposal facilities.
      (2)   Lot Dimensions.
         (a)   The areas of all lots shall not be less than the standards for
the zoning district in which they are located.
         (b)   Corner lots shall be a minimum of 50% larger than the minimum
lot area indicated for the zoning district in which it is located.
         (c)   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off
street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
         (d)   Adequate depth shall be allotted to new blocks and lots to
accommodate landscape buffers, where required.
         (e)   Where individual septic tanks have been authorized, sufficient
area shall be provided for a replacement sewage disposal system.
      (3)   Lot Lines.
         (a)   The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall be the
front line. All lots shall face the front line and a similar line across the
street. Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear line does
not abut the side line of an adjacent lot.
         (b)   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule
will give a better street or lot plan.
         (c)   Building setback lines shall be established on all lots, and the
minimum building set back line shall be appropriate for the location of the
development and for type of development and use contemplated, provided,
however, that they shall not be less than the standards established by the
zoning ordinance of the City of Noblesville.
      (4)   Lot Shape. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be
discouraged except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. Flag lots shall be prohibited.
      (5)   Access to Lots. Single- and two-family lots shall not derive access
from an arterial or major collector. Multi-family and Nonresidential lots
should not generally derive access exclusively from an arterial or major
collector street. Where driveway access from an arterial or major collector
street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Plan Commission may
require that such lots be served by a common and combined driveway in order to
limit possible traffic hazards on such street. Driveways shall be designed and
arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on arterials
and major collectors.
      (6)   Waterbodies and Watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains
a private water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to
distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent
lots. The Planning Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so
placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No more than
25% of the minimum area of a lot required under this chapter may be satisfied
by land that is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area
of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure, of design approved by the City or
County Engineer, as applicable.
      (7)   Utility Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear or
side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at
least 15 feet wide. Easements for streetlights shall be located as approved by
the Board of Public Works and Safety.
      (8)   Drainage. Lots shall be laid out to provide positive drainage away
from all buildings. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area.

§ 159.078 TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.
   (A)   Streets and Roads.
      (1)   Purpose. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width, and improvement to accommodate expected traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate street development so as to compose a convenient
system, avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties and assure compatibility
with long range comprehensive plans, all streets shall be designed according to
the standards set forth in these regulations. In designing and approving
subdivision streets, the following factors shall receive consideration:
         (a)   Safety for all vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
         (b)   Efficient ability of the roadway and related facilities to
accommodate the modes of transportation it is anticipated to serve including,
but not limited to, pedestrians, passenger cars, buses, emergency services and
freight;
         (c)   Livability or amenities as affected by traffic elements in the
circulation system;
         (d)   Economy of both construction and use of land.
      (2)   Applicability. Design of major collector and arterial streets shall
require special design and approval by the City Engineer. The following design
guidelines are specifically intended for streets within the subdivision, for
example, minor collectors and locals. Standards for each classification are
found in the Noblesville Standards.
      (3)   General Provisions.
         (a)   Conformance with thoroughfare plan, existing development, and
natural features.
            1.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way, as established in
the Comprehensive Master Plan.
            2.   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
            3.   Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (b)   Public Streets Required. All arterial and collector streets, as
shown on the Official Noblesville Thoroughfare Plan Map, a part of the
Comprehensive Master Plan shall be dedicated to the public. Local streets may
be private streets and shall meet the current adopted Noblesville Standards for
local streets including right-of-way width, pavement width, pavement
construction, etc., and additional requirements of the Unified Development
Ordinance. All private streets shall be inspected by the Engineering Department
for compliance with the Unified Development Ordinance and Noblesville
Standards.
         (c)   Frontage on Improved Roads Required. No subdivision shall be
approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access
from an existing street or a street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning
Commission and recorded in the County Recorder of Deeds' office. The street or
highway must be suitably improved as required by this Division, or be secured
by a performance bond required under the regulations of this chapter.
         (d)   Improvement of Noblesville Thoroughfares. Wherever the area to
be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, the road shall be suitably
improved as required by the City Engineer and approved by the Plan Commission.
Whenever a proposed subdivision borders an existing roadway, which is depicted
on the adopted Noblesville Thoroughfare Plan, the developer shall be required
to improve said roadway(s) in accordance with the Noblesville Standards Sheet 2
- Right of Way. The reconstruction or widening of such street as a condition of
plat approval and additional dedication of right-of-way may also be required.
Acceleration/deceleration lanes and passing blisters shall be constructed for
all new developments directly adjacent to a primary arterial, secondary
arterial, major collector, commercial collector or INDOT right-of-way.
         (e)   Subdivisions Abutting Arterials, Expressways, and Collectors.
Applicants may install a significant landscape and mounding treatment in order
to visually screen the backyards and the first floor elevation of the exterior
of homes on lots which abut such thoroughfares. Applicants shall provide
elevation drawings of the typical section of the proposed mounding and
landscaping treatment along with the common and scientific names and plant
sizes at the time of planting and maturity of the plant species to be provided
as a part of the subdivision application. The mound shall be a minimum height
at the peak of four feet and shall be planted as per the requirements of §§
159.180 through
159.190. An opaque fence or wall may be used in combination with the
landscaping and mounding subject to the approval of the Plan Commission.
         (f)   Half Streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where
unusual circumstances make such a facility necessary to the reasonable
development of a tract in conformance with these regulations and where
satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street is
provided. Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be dedicated within such
tract.
         (g)   Continuation of Streets and Dead End-Streets.
            1.   Continuation of Streets (Stub Streets). Streets in new
subdivisions should extend to the boundary line of the parcel to provide for
the future extension of said streets into adjacent areas when the continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for
efficient provision of utilities, and where the continuation is in accordance
with the Thoroughfare Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the
street must temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the
subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert
to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Planning Commission may limit
the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
            2.   Permanent Dead-End Streets (Cul-De-Sacs).
               a.   Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for
access to adjoining property, its terminus shall be in a cul-de-sac turnaround.
Permanent dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) shall not be longer than 600 feet. The
minimum radii for cul-de-sacs shall be as follows:
 
Use Type    Right-of-Way (ft.) Center of Cul-de-Sac to Back of Curb (ft.)
Residential 54                 40
Commercial  54                 50
Industrial  54                 50
 
               b.   Wherever a minor collector street serves exclusively an
industrial or commercial area, a cul-de-sac may be allowed and the length may
be increased to 1,000 feet. This special provision shall be allowed only in
areas which have a difficult access or are otherwise unsuitable for normal
subdividing. However, a 48-foot pavement width shall be required in all cases
under this special provision.
               c.   All streets to be terminated on a temporary basis shall be
constructed with a turnaround. The turnaround shall be constructed beyond all
lots intended for development. In a development which is not phased, the
turnaround shall be developed in a way that will not preclude the future
extension of the road.
         (h)   Guidelines for Street Location and Arrangement in Commercial/
Industrial Areas.
            1.   Alleys shall be provided in multiple dwelling or commercial
subdivisions unless other provisions are made for service access and off-street
loading and unloading. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
            2.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
         (i)   Maintenance of State Road 37 Right-of-Way. For all new
development abutting the right-of-way of SR37, the developer shall request that
the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) remove any existing fence in
said right-of-way. Thereafter, said right-of-way shall be maintained in good
condition, along with other exterior spaces on the premises, by the abutting
property owner.
         (j)   Right-of-way pavement widths refer to Noblesville Standards -
Sheet 2 Right of Way.
      (4)   Street Design Standards and Guidelines.
         (a)   Design Traffic Volumes. The design hourly volume (DHV) or
average daily traffic (ADT) is the accepted basis for design. In rural areas,
the Engineer of appropriate jurisdiction may amend the design standards as
determined by traffic demand analysis. However, the traffic volume does not
always determine the type of curves to be used in designing low volume
residential local and minor collector streets. Traffic volumes are a major
factor to be considered for streets serving commercial and industrial areas,
and the Engineer of appropriate jurisdiction is required to give special
attention to these areas.
         (b)   Design Speed. Design speeds are a factor for urban residential
local and minor collector design. In general, the same rule can be applied to
rural low volume roads in subdivision design. The sight distances and curve
radii are to be commensurate with average acceptable design speeds as indicated
by the Indiana Design Manual.
         (c)   Vertical Grades. Drainage design may become critical where
grades exceed 4%. For this reason, grades lower than the suggested tabular
values are encouraged. Commercial and industrial streets shall be held to a
maximum grade of 4%. Residential streets shall in no case exceed the tabular
values. In order to provide for proper drainage, the minimum grade should be
held to 0.5%. The maximum grade on the approach leg of any intersection shall
not exceed 5% in hilly terrain and 2% in level terrain.
         (d)   Super Elevation.
            1.   It should be considered in commercial and industrial areas and
for collector streets where operating speeds may exceed 30 to 35 miles per
hour. Where super elevation is used, street curves should be design for a
maximum elevation rate of:
               A.   Urban: 0.04 to 0.06 foot per foot.
               B.   Rural: 0.08 to 0.12 foot per foot.
            2.   Super elevation shall only be used when the designer has
demonstrated that the property horizontal curvature for the appropriate design
speed and the regulatory speed limit cannot be attained. Where super elevation
is not provided within residential areas, the proper signage shall be provided
with the appropriate advisory speed supplemental plaque.
         (e)   Horizontal Alignment. Minimum centerline radii for horizontal

§ 159.079 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. These stormwater drainage regulations are intended to
minimize off site water run-off, increase on-site infiltration, encourage
natural filtration functions, stimulate natural drainage systems, and minimize
off site discharge of pollutants. Stormwater shall be managed by the best and
most appropriate technology and environmentally-sound site planning and
engineering techniques, which may include combined retention facilities, porous
paving and piping, and swales; as well as traditional storm sewers and
retention basins.
   (B)   General Requirements. All new development shall make adequate
provision for storm or flood water runoff in accordance with the Noblesville
Stormwater Technical Standards or the requirements of the jurisdictional
agency. The applicant may also be required by the Plan Commission to carry away
by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of, the development. The drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewerage system. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 400 feet in any gutter. Surface
water drainage patterns shall be shown for each lot and block on the
development plat or plan.
   (C)   Public Storm Sewers.
      (1)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities. If the Commission determines that a connection
to a public storm sewer will eventually be provided as shown in existing local
plans and programs, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm
water disposal in the development by a public sewerage system at the time the
plat or plan receives secondary approval. Provision for such connection shall
be incorporated by inclusion in the Performance Bond required for the
development.
      (2)   Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where
feasible or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width. Drain
facilities shall be provided under driveways so that the flow of water in
ditches is not impeded.
      (3)   Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed according to the
Noblesville Stormwater Technical Standards or other methods required by the
engineer of appropriate jurisdiction, endorsed by the Technical Advisory
Committee, and approved by the Plan Commission, and a copy of the design
computations shall be completed in accordance with the Noblesville Stormwater
Technical Standards and be submitted along with plans and specifications.
      (4)   All storm sewers shall be self-cleaning systems without manhole
drops.
      (5)   All below-ground drainage systems, except for underground retention
facilities or pipes less then 12 inches in diameter shall be maintained by the

Connection Stormwater Ordinance" and all amendments thereto. (See §§ 52.01 et
seq.).
   (D)   Detention/Retention Ponds. If no public storm sewer outlets are
available within a reasonable distance, the disposal of storm waters shall be
accomplished through a detention pond.
      (1)   General Requirement.
         (a)   Where detention/retention facilities or "ponds" are used for
stormwater management, they shall accommodate site runoff generated from two-
year, ten-year, and 100-year storms considered individually in accordance with
the Noblesville Stormwater Technical Standards, unless the detention/retention
basin is classified as a dam, in which case it must also meet any applicable
dam safety standards.
         (b)   Runoff greater than that occurring from a 100 year, 24-hour
storm shall be passed over an emergency spillway.
         (c)   Detention/retention shall be provided to limit stormwater
discharge to the rates required by the Noblesville Stormwater Technical
Standards or the requirements of the jurisdictional agency.
         (d)   Detention facilities shall be located as far horizontally from

         (g)   The setback from the right-of-way at the Top of Bank shall be a
minimum of 50 feet. (Refer to the Noblesville Standards.)
         (h)   The setback from a property line not adjacent to a right-of-way
at the Top of Bank shall be a minimum of 15 feet. (Refer to the Noblesville
Standards.) This setback shall be referred to as an easement for maintenance
purposes and so indicated on the construction plans, recorded plats or other
recorded documents.
      (2)   Combined Facilities. Where possible, a detention pond may be
created so as to serve several adjacent parcels concurrently, subject to the
following criteria:
         (a)   The pond shall be designed with appropriate capacity to serve
all applicable sites, as determined by the Engineer of the applicable
jurisdiction.
         (b)   Provisions for completion of improvements and maintenance, or
any applicable bonds in lieu thereof, shall be coordinated between all
applicable sites, in a manner acceptable to the attorney of the applicable
jurisdiction.

facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff
from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
development. The design engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards, Noblesville
Stormwater Technical Standards, and specifications assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by this chapter.
   (F)   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The design engineer of the site
shall determine if the immediate downstream receiving pipe/culvert, system, or
waterways is sufficient to handle the stormwater runoff and note that in the
drainage calculations. The engineer of the applicable jurisdiction shall also
study the effect of each development on existing farther downstream drainage
facilities outside the area of the development. Local government drainage
studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve
as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional
runoff incident to the development will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the Planning Commission may withhold approval of the
development until provision has been made for the expansion of the existing
downstream drainage facility. No development shall be approved unless adequate
drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   (G)   Poor Drainage Areas. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area, or is
just upstream of an area, which is subject to ponding or flooding, the Plan
Commission may approve such application provided that the applicant's design
engineer designs a stormwater system to eliminate the ponding or flooding of
the site or the immediate downstream area and that it is acceptable by the
engineer of appropriate jurisdiction. The plan or system shall be constructed
and accepted by the engineer of jurisdiction prior to the approval of said
plat.
   (H)   Floodplain Access.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall, when it deems it necessary for the
health, safety, or welfare of the present and future population of the area and
necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities,
prohibit the development of any portion of the property which lies within the
flood plain. Any approvals within the floodplain shall, at a minimum, meet the
requirements of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Development plans, primary plats, secondary plats, preliminary
development plans and detailed development plans shall delineate the 100-year
floodplain and base flood elevations on said plans as referenced on the most
current adopted flood insurance rate maps for Hamilton County, Indiana, a part
of the National Flood Insurance Program as provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   (I)   Drainage Easements. Where a development is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel, or stream, the developer shall provide a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, and of such width and construction as will be acceptable to the
Engineer of appropriate jurisdiction. The easement shall be adequately
monumented; and, whenever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be
maintained by open channel with landscaped banks.

grading, excavating, removal, or destruction of the topsoil, trees, or other
vegetative cover of the land be commenced, until an Erosion Control Plan has
been reviewed by the Technical Advisory Committee or there has been a
determination by the Technical Advisory Committee that such plans are not
necessary.
      (2)   Erosion Control Plans shall be reviewed concurrently with the
development plan and become a part thereof, except that an Erosion Control Plan
may be filed and reviewed prior to the rest of the development plan for the
purpose of obtaining a Preliminary Grading Permit.
      (3)   The Erosion Control Plan shall provide all information, reports or
plans necessary for the application, including pre- and post-elevations and any
additional expense necessary to ensure adequate information, report or plan
shall be met by the applicant.

excavating, removal or destruction of topsoil, trees, or other vegetative cover
of land until approval has been received from the Technical Advisory Committee.
      (5)   No building permit shall be issued until the Planning Department
has received and reviewed a certified elevation certificate regarding the
parcels of land for which an improvement location permit was issued and a
building permit is sought.
   (B)   Review of Erosion Control Plans.
      (1)   The following measures are effective in minimizing erosion and
sedimentation and shall be included, where applicable, in the control plan. In
reviewing these measures, the Technical Advisory Committee shall be guided by
the information set forth in the findings in the National Cooperative Soil
Survey prepared by the USDA Soil Conservation Service in cooperation with the
Purdue Experiment Station and the Hamilton County Soil & Water Conservation
District, and the specifications set forth in both the Indiana Heartland Urban
Development Planning Guide and division (B)(2) herein and in accordance with

drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding; and all land
within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding.
            3.   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a
curbed street, storm drain, or natural watercourse. Where drainage swales are
used to divert surface waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or
planted as required and shall be of such slope, shape, and size as to conform
with the requirements of the City of Noblesville or Hamilton County, as the
case may be.
            4.   Concentration of surface water runoff shall be permitted only
in swales or watercourses.
            5.   Excavation and fills:

      (5)   Where a Development Plan Area is traversed by a watercourse, the
total development of the watercourse shall be considered. There shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourse, and of such width as will be adequate to preserve
natural drainage.
      (6)   Each applicant, person, corporation, or other entity which makes
any surface changes shall be required to:
         (a)   Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into an adequate outlet approved by the City Engineer.
         (b)   Handle existing and potential off-site runoff through his
development by designing to adequately handle storm runoff from a fully
developed drainage area.
         (c)   Pay his proportionate share of the total cost of off site
improvements to the common natural watercourse, based on a fully developed
drainage area.
         (d)   Provide and install at his expense, all drainage and erosion
control improvements (temporary and permanent) as required by the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan.
      (7)   It is the responsibility of the applicant or owner to keep all
major streams, not under the jurisdiction of another official agency, open and
free flowing.
      (8)   The applicant or owner will assume the responsibility for
maintaining an open and free flowing condition in all minor streams,
watercourses, and drainage systems, constructed or improved in accordance with
city and county design criteria on his property, which are necessary for proper
drainage in the discretion of the Director of Planning and Development if
adequate right-of-way exists or can be acquired.
   (D)   Enforcement. In the event the applicant or developer proceeds to clear
and grade prior to the approval of the Development Plan, the Board of Zoning

(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96)
§ 159.096 ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Official Zoning Map. The Planning Jurisdiction is hereby divided into
zones, or districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with
all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby declared to be a part of this
chapter.
      (1)   Identification Of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map
shall be identified by certification and bear the seal of the City under the
following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map
referred to in Article 7 of Ordinance Number 62-12-95 of the City of
Noblesville, State of Indiana," together with the date of adoption of this
chapter. Certification should be by the signature of the Mayor and attested by
the City Clerk-Treasurer. The title "Official Zoning Map" in large letters may
be placed in an appropriate open space around the map or in the title block.
      (2)   Maintenance Of Official Zoning Map. If in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter changes are made in district boundaries or other
matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on
the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the
Common Council with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: On  (date)
by official action of the Common Council, the following changes were made on
the Official Zoning Map:                               , which entry shall be
initialed by the Director or Chairman of the Plan Commission and attested by
the City Clerk Treasurer. No changes of any nature shall be made on the
Official Zoning Map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the
procedures set forth in this chapter. Any unauthorized change of any kind by a
person or persons shall be considered a violation of this chapter and
punishable as provided under §
159.999.
      (3)   Location Of Official Zoning Map. Regardless of the existence of
purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which from time to time may be
published, the Official Zoning Map shall be located in the office of the Clerk-
Treasurer of the City of Noblesville. It shall be the final authority as to the
current zoning status of land and water areas in the City, and its
administrative jurisdictional area.
      (4)   Replacement Of Official Zoning Map. Refer to I.C. 36-7-4-608.
   (B)   Establishment of Zoning Districts. The zones or districts established
in the Noblesville Planning Jurisdiction are as follows:
      (1)   Residential Districts.
         Low Density Single-Family Suburban Residential (SR)
         Low Density Single-Family Residential (R-1)
         Low to Moderate Density Single-Family Residential District (R-2)
         Moderate to High Density Single-Family Residential District (R-3)
         Moderate to High Density One and Two-Family Residential District (R-4)
         Moderate to High Density Multi-Family Residential District (R-5)
         Residential Mobile Home Park (RMH)
         Residential Planned Development (R/PD)
      (2)   Commercial Districts.
         Local Business (LB)
         General Business (GB)
         Downtown (DT)
         Planned Business (PB)

         Flood Hazard (FH) District
         Federal Hill Planned Development (FeHiPD) District
   (C)   Interpretation of District Sequence
      (1)   General Rule. This chapter rejects as outdated and inappropriate
the concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and, except as
noted below, is based on the concept that each district should be designed to
accomplish a specific purpose, to encourage a particular type of development,
and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible
types of development.
      (2)   Special Rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is
recognized that, when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing
characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that
might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this chapter recognized the
concept of "more restrictive" and "less restrictive" districts, and the
districts established by this chapter shall be considered "more restrictive" or
"less restrictive" in accordance with the following rules.
         (a)   The residential districts shall be deemed more restrictive than
any nonresidential district.
         (b)   The SR District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive
residential district and the R-5 District shall be deemed to be the least
restrictive residential district, and the residential districts shall be deemed
to become less restrictive as the district number increases.
         (c)   The commercial, industrial and special districts shall be deemed
to be equally restrictive.
   (D)   Rules For Interpretation Of District Boundaries. Where uncertainty
exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:

portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the
remaining portion of the lot.
   (E)   Annexed Land. All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City
of Noblesville shall be zoned consistent with the land use policy of the
comprehensive plan and with the zoning district most similar to the zoning
which was applicable prior to annexation, as long as that zoning is consistent
with the comprehensive plan land use policy map.
   (F)   Zoning District Equivalency Table. Zoning districts existing prior to
the effective date of this chapter, but which are no longer a district
described by this chapter, shall require a map amendment to an equivalent and
appropriate district which is described in this chapter. Additionally,
districts newly created by this chapter, but which do not currently exist on
the zoning map, may later be a part of the Zoning map subsequent to a map
amendment. Prior to the amendment of the zoning map for such purposes, the
following Table 4 shall be used to establish the relationship between existing

commercial uses as per the Hamilton County Zoning Ordinance and the Adopted
Planned Development Application and Supplemental Documentation for those
particular parcels of property as evidenced on the maps in Appendix J.
Originally, these parcels were under the county's jurisdiction for zoning and
uses or during a time period of not being within the zoning jurisdiction of
either the city or Hamilton County thereby creating a "No Zoning Area." The
permitted uses and the bulk requirements shall be established as per the
adopted Hamilton County Zoning Ordinance and/or Adopted Planned Development
Application and Supplemental Documentation in effect at that time.
      (2)   The parcels will remain as a city zoning district of "B/PD" until
such time the properties are rezoned to an existing city zoning district
including bulk requirements. These parcels include the following:
         (a)   Hood's Gardens at 11644 Summer Road (County Zoned
A4–Agricultural Business District) (Parcel Numbers 10-11-16-00-00-014.000, 10-

public hearing before the Plan Commission and Common Council or the Board of
Zoning Appeals. (Refer to Appendix J).
   (F)   Corporate Campus Planned Development District (CCPD)
      (1)   Purpose and Procedures. The purpose of the Corporate Campus Planned
Development District (CCPD) is to encourage economic development activity and
high quality, well-integrated development both north and south of the 146th
Street corridor, east of State Road 37 to Prairie Baptist Road and Atlantic
Road, and north of the I-69 interchange. This district is intended to provide
for a broad range of uses, thus expanding employment opportunities in
Noblesville and enhancing its tax base. Within this district are a number of
subdistricts that represent various physical character areas. Although the CCPD
District shall be developed in a unified and coordinated fashion, each of the
subdistricts has tailored a purpose, use, bulk and site development standards
reflective of its location, function, and desired appearance within the
corporate campus park. It is the intent of this district to augment the other
bulk provisions of this chapter. When not specifically addressed by this
district, the bulk standard provisions of this chapter shall apply.
         (a)   Review Procedures.
            1.   All development within the CCPD District shall be subject to
site plan review, Unified Development Ordinance subdivision regulations, and
site development standards, in addition to the use, bulk, and site development
standards of this section. The following types of development proposals are
subject to the procedures and requirements for planned developments contained
in §
159.047, Planned Developments, and §
159.109(D), Planned Development (PD) Overlay District:
               A.   All proposed subdivisions.
               B.   All development proposals in the Mixed Residential
Subdistrict (unless otherwise specified).
               C.   All development proposals that include requests for any
exceptions from the standards listed for this district and/or subdistricts.
               D.   All proposed uses listed as Special Considerations in
Appendix D. These uses are not assumed permitted by-right and thus, there shall
be no presumption of their approval. Special considerations, if any are to be
given, must be specifically approved by the Plan Commission and Council.
               E.   All development proposals in the Agricultural/I-
O Subdistrict.
            2.   All other development proposals shall be required to submit
all information for a detailed development plan as outlined in this section;
however, the plan shall be subject to review by city staff, rather than the
Plan Commission.
      (2)   Establishment of Subdistricts. The City of Noblesville hereby
creates a set of subdistricts that represent physical character areas within
the CCPD District. The subdistricts are as follows:
         (a)   Interchange Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Interchange
Subdistrict is to address development sites that are visible from Greenfield
Avenue/State Road 238 and 146th Street, but are not directly accessible from
them. High quality building design and site improvements are a priority in this
area, which functions as the “eastern gateway” into Noblesville. Site access
and signage must be carefully planned to orient drivers. Site design and
parking lot layout must recognize the “double-fronted” nature of development
sites in this area.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of commercial and office uses shall be
permitted in the Interchange Subdistrict, in this section with the approved
Corporate Campus Land Use and Subdistricts map. Where indicated on the map,
commercial uses shall be designed in a pedestrian-oriented manner. The complete
use matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (b)   146th Street Corridor Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the 146th Street
Corridor Subdistrict is to address development sites that are visible from
146th Street, but are not directly accessible from it. High quality building
design and site improvements are a priority in this area because this corridor
functions as the “spine” of the overall corporate campus park. Site access and
signage must be carefully planned to orient drivers. Site design and parking
lot layout must recognize the “double-fronted” nature of development sites in
this area.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of commercial, office, and industrial
uses shall be permitted in the 146th Street Corridor Subdistrict, in accordance
with an approved Land Use and Subdistricts map. Any newly established user that
may be categorized as a "Tax Exempt User" as defined by Ordinance No. 16-05-13
within this subdistrict is prohibited. Where indicated on the map, commercial
uses shall be designed in a pedestrian-oriented manner. The complete use matrix
is contained in
Appendix C.
         (c)   View Corridor Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the View Corridor
Subdistrict is to address development sites that are highly visible from key
regional arterials (I-69 and State Road 37), but are not directly accessible
from them. The design quality and presence of buildings in this area is
important as viewed from afar as well as upon closer approach. Site design and
parking lot layout must address the “double-fronted” nature of development
sites in this area.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of commercial, office, and industrial
uses shall be permitted in the View Corridor Subdistrict, in accordance with an
approved Land Use and Subdistricts map. Any newly established user that may be
categorized as a "Tax Exempt User" as defined by Ordinance No. 16-05-13 within
this subdistrict is prohibited. Where indicated on the map, commercial uses
shall be designed in a pedestrian-oriented manner. The complete use matrix is
contained in
Appendix C.
         (d)   Interchange Flex Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Interchange Flex
Subdistrict is to address development sites that , are visible from key
secondary arterials and may have direct access from them depending upon lot
size. Generous landscaped setbacks and high quality site improvements are key
to establishing the appropriate image for this area. Adequate buffering is
required where dissimilar land uses abut one another (including residential).
The Interchange Flex Subdistrict permits only industrial, office, and related
flex uses.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of office and industrial uses shall be
permitted in the Interchange Flex Subdistrict, in accordance with an approved
Land Use and Subdistricts map. The complete use matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (e)   Secondary Corridor Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Secondary
Corridor Subdistrict is to address development sites that are visible from key
secondary arterials (including Greenfield Avenue/State Road 238) and may have
direct access from them depending upon lot size. Generous landscaped setbacks
and high quality site improvements are key to establishing the appropriate
image for this area. Adequate buffering is required where dissimilar land uses
abut one another (including residential). The Secondary Corridor Subdistrict
permits a broader range of uses including industrial, office, and commercial
uses.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of commercial, office, and industrial
uses shall be permitted in the Secondary Corridor Subdistrict, in accordance
with an approved Land Use and Subdistricts map. Where indicated on the map,
commercial uses shall be designed in a pedestrian-oriented manner. The complete
use matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (f)   Internal Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Internal
Subdistrict is to address development sites that are not highly visible from
key arterials. While a basic standard of quality is expected, the required
level of site improvements and architectural quality is not as high as in other
subdistricts. Emphasis is placed on the design of building entries and signage
more than the overall building design. Adequate buffering is required where
dissimilar land uses abut one another (including residential).
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of office and industrial uses shall be
permitted in the Internal Subdistrict, in accordance with an approved Land Use
and Subdistricts map. The complete use matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (g)   Mixed Residential District.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Mixed
Residential Subdistrict is to address areas where a diversity of residential
development is appropriate within the Corporate Campus Planned Development
District. The range of residential uses that are permitted within this
subdistrict include single family detached, single family attached, two-family,
and multiple family residential, provided it is designed in an integrated
manner. The design standards included within this section are intended to
ensure that residential development within the Corporate Campus is attractive,
and yet remains affordable.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of residential and complementary
institutional uses shall be permitted in the Mixed Residential Subdistrict, in
accordance with an approved Land Use and Subdistricts map. The complete use
matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (h)   Regional Recreation and Entertainment Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Regional
Recreation and Entertainment Subdistrict is to address existing recreation and
entertainment uses within the subdistrict and the potential for future
development sites that are visible from key thoroughfares, including but not
limited to Greenfield Avenue/State Road No. 238, 146th Street, Boden Road, and
Olio Road, and may have direct access from them depending upon lot size.
Generous landscaped setbacks and high quality site improvements are key to
establishing the appropriate image for this area as future development occurs
on the existing recreation and entertainment site. Adequate buffering is
required where dissimilar land uses abut one another (including residential).
The Regional Recreation and Entertainment Subdistrict permits a range of full
service entertainment facilities and uses as well as office and industrial
facilities and uses.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of regional entertainment facilities
and uses shall be permitted in the Regional Recreation and Entertainment
Subdistrict in accordance with an approved Land Use and Subdistricts map. Where
indicated on the map, uses shall be designed in a pedestrian-oriented manner.
The complete use matrix is contained in
Appendix C.
         (i)   Agricultural/I-O Subdistrict.
            1.   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of the Agricultural/I-
O Subdistrict is to address development sites that are in areas that are
presently primarily agricultural or rural in nature. This district is
identified in areas that are generally on the periphery of the Corporate Campus
as a whole with a development timeline that is anticipated to exceed the more
high-profile subdistricts. Agricultural and rural residential uses will
continue to operate as they currently exist until such time as development in
the area occurs. It is expected that development in this district will be non-
residential in nature, with permitted uses ranging from industrial and office
to other related flex uses. Generous landscaped setbacks and high quality site
improvements are key to establishing the appropriate image for this area,
respecting the character of the pre-existing agricultural and residential uses.
Adequate buffering is required where dissimilar land uses abut one another
including residential.
            2.   Use Requirements. A mix of office and industrial uses shall be
permitted in the Agricultural/I-O Subdistrict, in accordance with an approved
Land Use and Subdistricts map. The complete use matrix is contained in
Appendix C. Residential uses are permitted to continue according to this
section.
      (3)   Public Right-of-Way and Infrastructure Improvements.
         (a)   Improvements.
            1.   Unifying streetscape elements must be provided at adjacent
public rights-of-way, including street lights, street trees, sodded parkways,
continuous sidewalks, and hike/bike trails where appropriate.
            2.   Street lights are to be installed at all public rights-of-way
per city specifications. These lights shall have a uniform and consistent
design throughout the development.
               A.   Sidewalks.
                  (i)   A continuous five-foot public sidewalk shall be
provided within the public right-of-way, per city specifications, making
connections to sidewalks at adjacent properties. Where space permits, sidewalks
must meander toward and away from the curb line, to no closer than five feet
and no further than 30 feet from the curb. The curve shall be gradual, to
discourage short-cuts. This sidewalk may be replaced with an asphalt path, as
required by the Access Framework Plan and the Noblesville Alternative
Transportation Plan (NAT), if deemed appropriate.
                  (ii)   Public sidewalk configuration must provide direct
access to curbside transit stops where appropriate. These access points shall
be American with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant and installed pursuant to
City regulations.
                  (iii)   Hike/bike trails and trail heads shall be provided
where indicated on the Access Framework Plan and the Noblesville Alternative
Transportation Plan (NAT), per city specifications, making connections to trail
segments at adjacent properties.
               B.   Landscaping.
                  (i)   Deciduous street trees of two and one-half to three-
inch caliper at the rate of one tree for every 40 linear feet of right-of-way
are required to be installed in a mulch bed of a maximum eight feet in
diameter. Street trees must always be located between the curb and the public
sidewalk, and need not be in a straight line if the sidewalk meanders. Required
street trees are in addition to the on-site landscaping required per the
previous section. Permitted tree species shall be those listed on the approved
planting lists of the City of Noblesville.
                  (ii)   Unpaved portions of the right-of-way shall be
established in turf by either sodding (preferred) or seeding.
                  (iii)   Median strips between divided roads and driveways
shall be landscaped with trees and low shrub masses accented with annuals/
perennials. Plantings shall be focused at intersections and “gateway” areas,
and shall cover a minimum of 30% of the unpaved area of the median strip.
Unplanted areas shall be maintained in turf.
                  (iv)   Along primary arterials, a berm and landscape
treatment shall be installed that will buffer buildings and parking facilities
from view. The berm should be at least four feet in height, and plantings shall
be pursuant to the buffering requirements of §§
159.180 through
159.191. In some cases, this buffer can be installed in lieu of the buffering
requirements for individual uses. The look and feel of the treatment should be
consistent throughout the corridor.
               C.   Detention.
                  (i)   Detention/ retention ponds shall be located and
designed to be natural in appearance and enhance the entry sequence and/or view
of buildings.
                  (ii)   Wet detention facilities and water features, side
slopes above the water line shall not exceed 4:1, and wetland/aquatic
vegetation shall be planted around at least 75% of the wet area perimeter. The
maximum “freeboard” of all detention areas shall not exceed three feet. All
detention facilities shall be required to install safety ledges pursuant to the
requirements of this chapter and as approved by the City Engineer.
                  (iii)   Dry detention areas shall maintain a maximum slope of
4:1, and shall be graded to harmonize with the overall open space design of the
site.
      (4)   General Regulations.
         (a)   Non-Residential Site Planning Regulations.
            1.   Commercial uses shall be “master planned” in conjunction with
adjacent office uses to facilitate efficient circulation and shared parking.
            2.   Where developments include several buildings, they shall be
grouped to create outdoor spaces/plazas.
            3.   Open space shall be located contiguous to open space on
adjacent sites to maximize their combined visual effect.
            4.   A straightforward and visually pleasant approach to building
entrances shall be provided, with a drop-off area near office building
entrances.
            5.   No accessory structure shall be located within any required
setback.
            6.   Equipment.
               A.   No storage areas, garbage containers, or mechanical
equipment shall be located within any required setback.
               B.   Mechanical equipment, garbage containers, and satellite
dishes shall be completely and permanently screened from view of public rights-
of-way and adjoining properties. When attached to the ground, screening methods
shall include a solid wall or fence enclosure of a material that matches the
principal building. When roof mounted, screening methods may include parapet
walls or other architectural treatments approved by the Planning Director.
               C.   The colors and materials of all screening methods shall
match and be in coordination with the colors and materials of the principal
building.
            7.   Drive-thru. Where drive-thru uses are permitted, drive-thru
windows and lanes are not permitted to face any street.

shall be of a consistent type/style/finish throughout the site. If adjacent to
a residential district, light standards shall not exceed 15 feet in height
within 150 feet of the lot line. Light intensity on sites that are adjacent to
a residential district shall be no more than one-half foot-candle as measured
along property lines that abut the residential district.
               B.   Light standards that are used must be approved by the city
prior to their use, and the illumination of the standards shall be subject to
the standards of this chapter.
               C.   Lighting shall serve only to illuminate signage, parking/
loading areas, walkways and entrances, or to accent landscaping and
architectural details.
               D.   Colored, exposed neon, flashing or moving lights are
prohibited.
               E.   All lights shall be installed in a manner to best hide and
shield point source lighting.
            9.   Circulation.
               A.   The Land Use and Subdistrict and Access Framework and
Thoroughfare Master Plan maps identify a potential roadway network. The maps
identify potential locations of arterials and collectors, and all other
proposed roads that are not identified would most likely be constructed as
local streets.
               B.   Permitted roadway types (per approved Access Framework and
Thoroughfare Master Plan) in all subdistricts are primary arterial, secondary
arterial, collector, and local streets.
               C.   A continuous circulation system must be maintained within
large private developments; cul-de-sacs are strongly discouraged.
               D.   Off-street pedestrian and auto connections shall be
provided between sites where feasible, especially between office and commercial
uses.
               E.   Safe pedestrian and bicycle routes shall be delineated
within private developments, and connect to the public sidewalk and regional

               B.   Service vehicle/truck traffic must be separated from
automobile traffic.
            11.   Access Regulations.
               A.   Roads and driveway cuts must be aligned to create four-way
intersections. Access points located on opposite sides of the street should be
designed to line up the respective left turn lanes, where the road has no
center median.
               B.   Curb cuts are not permitted within 350 feet of an
intersection on any arterial street, or within 300 feet of an intersection on
any collector street.
               C.   Where permitted, outlets in commercial, and mixed
developments shall only be accessed from internal roadways, and shall share
driveways and parking lots wherever feasible.
               D.   In Interchange, 146th Street Corridor, and View Corridor
Subdistricts, direct access from primary arterials to development sites is
prohibited, and direct access from secondary arterials is only allowed for
sites at least eight acres in size. Direct access from secondary arterials may
not occur more frequently than once every 1,000 feet.
               E.   In Interchange Flex, Secondary Corridor, and Internal
Subdistricts, direct access from primary arterials to development sites is
prohibited. Direct access from secondary arterials is only allowed for sites at
least ten acres in size. Direct access from secondary arterials may not occur
more frequently than once every 1,000 feet.
               F.   Parcels containing a minimum of five acres and a minimum
parcel width of 450 feet may be granted one additional driveway cut based on
the merits of unique and/or unusual circumstances on a case-by-case basis and
approval by the Planning Director. The driveway cut may not be permitted in all
cases.

as part of a master plan development.
2   Accessory building should not exceed principal building height or the maximum height allowable, whichever is less.
3   Pedestrian-oriented areas have a maximum front setback of 5 feet.
4   Where side or rear yards abut residentially zoned property, the setback is 50 feet.
5   See §
159.107(H)(8) for landscaping/screening requirements.
6   Detention ponds are permitted within front yard setbacks; however, structures must be set back at least 20 feet from the top of
the bank.
7   See §
159.107(H(6) for parking/loading requirements.
8   Industrial use building shall maintain a two-story office component with the potential for a single-story manufacturing/
warehousing component at the rear of the building on a case-by-case basis with approval by the Planning Director. Retail buildings are
encouraged to be two-story buildings but may be approved as single-story buildings on a case-by-case basis with the approval of the
Planning Director.
         (b)   Residential General Regulations.
            1.   Existing Residential Uses in Non-Residential Subdistricts. The
following site development standards shall apply to all subdistricts within the
CCPD District, with the exception of the Mixed Residential Subdistrict.
               A. Authority to Continue. Where, at the time of adoption of an
ordinance that assigns the CCPD (Corporate Campus) to a Noblesville
Jurisdictional zoning map, lawful residential uses of land which exist and
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by the CCPD, may be continued
so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
               B.   Enlargement/Improvement of Existing Residential Structure.
Such nonconforming uses may be enlarged or increased to occupy a greater area
of land than was occupied at the effective date of rezone so long as such
improvements do not result in an increase of the value of the structure by more
than 50% of the pre-improvement value.
               C.   Moving a Residential Structure. No such nonconforming uses
shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other
than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of the rezone.
               D.   Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment of Use. If any
such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for more than one
year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
               E.   New Construction of Residential Buildings. The only new
structures that shall be permitted shall be clearly accessory to the existing
residential use of the property and shall adhere to the standards for accessory
structures as outlined in §
159.121. No additional homes or separate living units shall be constructed in
the CCPD unless such uses are permitted uses in the land use area, and then
shall adhere to the R1 Low Density Single-Family Residential zoning district
regulations.
               F.   Damage or Destruction. Should such nonconforming
residential structures be destroyed or damaged by any means, then the home may
be reconstructed in a manner equal to the fair market value of the building
immediately prior to the damage.
               G.   Underlying Standards. Any residential improvements inside
the CCPD district shall adhere to the underlying developmental standards of the
Rl (Single-Family Residential) district.
               H.   Conflict with §§
159.220 through
159.226. In the case where the specific provisions of this division (H) are in
conflict with §§
159.220 through
159.226 (Nonconforming Uses And Structures), the standards of this division (H)
shall apply.
            2.   Mixed Use Residential Subdistrict Regulations. In the Mixed
Residential Subdistrict, the following design guidelines shall be utilized in
evaluation of the proposed planned development proposal. Conformance with the
design guidelines may permit additional density within the identified density
range, above the 2.4 units/acre specified above. Design standards within this
Subdistrict are required. Guidelines are not mandatory. While strict adherence
to guidelines is not required, projects that do not adhere to some or all of
the guidelines should only be presumed to be allowed a base density that is at
the low end of the range permitted and to be required to comply with the
established base bulk requirements.
               A.   Bulk Requirements.
                  (i)   Maximum density.
                     a.   The intent of this district is to provide for a
variety of housing types, often times within an individual development. To
encourage these multiple housing types, as well as a high quality design and
affordability, a set of residential design guidelines and a density range has
been identified. The permitted density shall be dependent upon adherence to the
design guidelines and shall be at the discretion of the City Council, in
accordance with the Planned Development procedure. The base density in the
single-family areas shall be 2.4 dwelling units to the acre where there is
access to public sewer. The base density shall be one unit per two acres where
private sewer systems are proposed. With consideration of the guidelines
established for this subdistrict, as well as consideration of the specific
products and subdivision designs on a case by case basis, planned developments
may be approved that allow the maximum permitted density in the single family
areas to range from 2.4 to six dwelling units per acre.
                     b.   The base density in the multiple family areas shall
be 14 dwelling units per the acre. Dependent upon compliance with the
guidelines established for this subdistrict, as well as the quality,
affordability, and/or mix of specific products and subdivision design proposed,
planned developments may be approved that permit a maximum permitted density to
range from seven to 20 dwelling units per acre.
                  (ii)   Minimum Lot Area and Width. Because a density range
has been identified as a means of encouraging high quality residential design
and a variety of product types, the minimum permitted lot area and width may
vary, dependent upon the density permitted. However, the base lot areas and lot
widths for each housing type are as follows:
 
HOUSING TYPE                                     BASE LOT AREA      LOT WIDTH
Single family detached dwellings (public sewer)  15,000 square feet 100 feet
Single family detached dwellings (private sewer) 2 acres            200 feet
Single family attached dwellings (up to four
units)                                           6,000 square feet  60 feet
(Permitted only on public sewer)
Multiple family dwellings (Permitted only on     3,000 square feet  150 feet
public sewer)
 
                  (iii)   Maximum Building Height.
                     a.   Single family detached dwellings: 35 feet.
                     b.   Single family attached dwellings (up to four units):
40 feet.
                     c.   Multiple family dwellings: 45 feet.
                     d.   Accessory buildings shall be a maximum height: 15
feet.
                  (iv)   Maximum Permitted Floor Area Ratio.
                     a.   Single family detached dwellings: 0.5.
                     b.   Single family attached dwellings (up to four units):
0.6.
                     c.   Multiple family dwellings: 0.6.
                  (v)   Setbacks.
                     a.   Front Yard Setbacks (minimum).
                        (I)   Single family dwellings: 25 feet local and
collector streets.
                        (II)   Single family attached: 50 feet arterial
streets.
                        (III)   Multiple family dwellings: 50 feet all streets.
                     b.   Side Yard Setback (minimum). Eight feet for all
housing types, except multiple family and single family attached dwellings,
which shall provide a minimum separation of ten feet between individual
buildings.
                     c.   Rear Yard Setback (minimum).
                        (I)   Principal buildings: 20 feet.
                        (II)   Accessory buildings: five feet.
                     d.   For certain product types, it may be necessary, in
certain circumstances and on a case by case basis, to reduce these standards.
For this reason, this standard may be varied as part of the planned development
process subject to approval by the Council.
                  (vi)   Minimum floor area per dwelling.
                     a.   Single Family: 1,800 square feet.
                     b.   Multiple Family: 600 square feet.
                     c.   For certain product types, it may be necessary to
reduce this standard. For this reason, this standard may be varied as part of
the planned development process.
         (c)   Design Standards Applicable to AH Residential Development.
            1.   Each development should have standards for uniform
streetlights, mailboxes, fencing, and sidewalks.
            2.   A 50-foot buffer yard shall be maintained around all
residential developments, unless otherwise reduced through the Planned
Development process.
            3.   No fences or other structures, permanent or temporary, shall
be permitted within the 50-foot buffer yard.
            4.   Common open space and recreational facilities may warrant
additional density, provided that the common open space areas consist of a
minimum of 15% of the site. This open space area must be active in nature, and
shall not include public rights-of-way, easements, floodplain areas, or
landscape setback areas. Large open space and retention areas (generally larger
than 10,000 square feet) may only be counted if they are improved to include
active and passive amenities. Generally, wet detention facilities shall not
count toward the 15% requirement. Useable open space should be located no
further than 1A mile from the most distant house in the subdivision.
            5.   Inside the 50-foot landscape buffer, trees shall be planted at
a minimum rate of one tree per 40 feet and mounding shall be required as
approved during the Planned Development process.
            6.   Local streets should be extended to provide access between
adjoining neighborhoods at appropriate intervals. Streets should generally be
designed in a grid network and cul-de-sacs are discouraged.
         (d)   Guidelines for Single-Family Detached and Two-Family Attached
Dwellings.
            1.   Where detached garages are proposed, dwellings with detached
garages that are located in the rear yard and accessed via alleys are the
preferred garage design. However, the second preference is detached garages
that are located in the rear yard and accessed from the street.
            2.   Where dwellings are designed with attached garages, rear
loaded garages that have access off of alleys are preferred. The second
preference is for rear loaded garages that access from the front. The third
preference is side-loaded garages. The least desirable design is a dwelling
with an attached front-facing garage. Such garages shall occupy no more than
33% of the front facade. Individual garage doors designed with windows are
encouraged.
            3.   In an effort to promote diversity of housing, subdivisions
shall vary the following: buildings’ relationship to the street by staggering
setbacks a minimum of 5 feet for 25% of each block face; driveway orientation
or location; the side yard setback and/or lot widths by ten feet for 25% of the
lots on each block face.
            4.   Each development over 100 acres should have a minimum of two
product types that address two different market categories.
            5.   A landscape package including a minimum of one shade tree and
ten shrubs and/or ornamental trees per dwelling unit shall be installed on each
lot.
            6.   Generally, lots of less than 60 feet in width should have
rear-loaded garages that access from an alley.
         (e)   Guidelines for Single-Family Attached and Multiple-Family
Residential.
            1.   All townhouse and multiple-family residential units should be
designed to be oriented toward the street. Where larger developments are
designed with internal circulation systems, at least some dwelling units should
be oriented to the exterior of the development so as to promote connection and
integration of the multiple family development with adjacent uses. Townhouse or
multiple-family developments, which are oriented with the sidewalls facing the
street, are discouraged.
            2.   All single family attached dwellings should have one main
entrance for each structure that faces the street at an angle of no more than
45 degrees from the street, or opens onto a porch or a stoop. At least 50% of
the units should be designed with building entrances, rather than garage doors
fronting on the street at the ground floor level.
            3.   Attached garages should be located at the rear of the dwelling
unit, and face the interior of the development, rather than the street. The
least desirable design is a dwelling with an attached street-facing garage.
Such garages shall only be permitted if they do not protrude beyond the front
building line and provide access via an internal drive or frontage road, rather
than with individual curb cuts for each dwelling unit. Individual garage doors
designed with windows are encouraged.
         (f)   Existing Residential Lots in Residential Subdistricts.
            1.   Planned Development approval shall not be required for a
building permit for a single family home that does not involve the subdivision
of property, is on property of at least five acres in size, and is located
within the Single-Family or Multi-Family Subdistricts.
      (5)   Architectural Standards.
         (a)   Architectural Review Procedure.
            1.   Architectural review shall be required for all residential
developments pursuant to the standards of this subchapter and §§
159.025 through
159.033.
            2.   A.   With regard to non-residential developments,
architectural plans for all primary and accessory buildings shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to permit an understanding of the style of the
development, the design of the buildings, and the number, size, and type of
structures. A complete set of color 360-degree elevations detailing the front,
rear, and opposite side views of each proposed above ground structure shall be
provided. Key exterior elements such as materials, windows, architectural
breaks, etc. must be rendered in sufficient detail and accompanied by clear
descriptions of materials specifications, colors, and textures.
               B.   If the architectural standards of the CCPD district are
met, the review of the architectural plans shall be completed by the Planning
staff. Appeals of staff’s interpretations shall go to the Architectural Review
Board who shall render a decision pursuant to the procedures established.
         (b)   Non-Residential General Architecture Requirements. The following
design/architecture requirements shall apply to all non-residential
Subdistricts within the Corporate Campus district:
            1.   High quality building design and construction shall be
provided on all elevations (360 degree architectural treatment) in all
Subdistricts, with the exception that in the Internal Subdistrict,
architectural detailing shall be focused on the building entry and on facades
visible from any roadway.
            2.   The scale, mass, color and proportion of the building shall
reflect the character of the area in which it is located and shall be
compatible with adjoining developments.
            3.   Multiple buildings in developments (including accessory
buildings and detached outlet buildings in commercial centers, where permitted)
must incorporate coordinated architectural styles, materials, forms, features,
colors and applied elements to visually tie the development together.
            4.   Antennas shall be roof-mounted only, shall project no more
than 12 feet above the height of the building, and shall be positioned to
minimize visibility from public rights-of-way. One antenna is allowed per
building, except that at buildings with more than one tenant, a maximum of two
shall be allowed per building.
            5.   Signage, fencing, walls, and other amenities (benches, lights)
must be integrated with building design and landscaping.
            6.   Building Trim.
               A.   The use of accent and trim elements (accent panels,
banding, cornices, canopies/awnings, etc.) is recommended to add visual
interest and break down the scale of facades.
               B.   Permitted building trim materials include: brick (clay),
stone, simulated cut stone, tile (ceramic or porcelain), wood, glass, painted
aluminum, formed polymers (“Fypon”), and EIFS as permitted in the individual
subdistricts.
            7.   Facades.
               A.   Glazing shall not exceed 75% of any facade.
               B.   Facade treatments shall be designed to break large facade
areas into smaller facades.
               C.   Exterior materials must be consistent on all facades, and
material/finish changes should relate to the “structure” of the building.
               D.   Colors used on building facades must be complementary.
Natural, muted colors should serve as the primary facade color, with brighter
colors used only as limited accents.
            8.   Roofs.
               A.   Pitched roofs shall be required on buildings used for all
small-scale retail, service, and office uses. Small-scale shall generally mean
one-story buildings, however, the design and location of some buildings, which
are more than one story in height, may require pitched roofs to be used as
well.
               B.   Rooflines and roof profiles shall be varied to create
visual interest. One-story buildings must incorporate sloped roofs or tall
parapets to architecturally conceal roof-mounted equipment.
               C.   All rooftop equipment, including vents greater than one
foot in height, shall be screened from view from all ground level vantage
points by parapet walls, rooftop walls, or recesses in sloped roofs.
               D.   Rooftop equipment screens and rooftop penetrations (vents)
shall be of a color compatible with the overall building or roof color (not an
accent color).
               E.   Roof materials should be traditional in composition and
complement the architectural features of the structure.
               F.   Where pitched roofs are required or requested; appropriate
pitches shall be used based on the circumstance.
            9.   All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of
the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its
relationship to the surrounding area.
         (c)   Subdistrict Specific Architecture Requirements.
            1.   Interchange Subdistrict.
               A.   In pedestrian-oriented commercial areas, a continuous
“street wall” of facades shall be created. There shall be easy access from
parking areas to the shopping street or plaza.
               B.   Facades shall incorporate three or more vertical planes,
and create both a “rhythm” of facade bays or structural elements, and a
horizontal division into a base, middle and top.
               C.   Main building entrances must be prominently featured
through porticos, recessed entrances, lighting, and landscaping. Weather
protection should be provided at all entrances.
               D.   Appropriate building finish materials include: brick
(clay), natural stone, simulated cut stone, finished (textured and painted)
concrete, tile (ceramic or porcelain), glass (clear or lightly tinted),
standing seam metal roofs, slate/imitation slate roof shingles, architectural
asphalt roof shingles, and EIFS (“Dryvit”) as a limited trim material only.
               E.   Inappropriate, prohibited building finish materials
include: wood, plywood, unfinished concrete or concrete panels, concrete
masonry units, EIFS (“Dryvit”) wall systems, steel or aluminum curtain wall
systems, plastics, reflective glass.
            2.   146th Street Corridor Subdistrict.
               A.   Facades must incorporate three or more vertical planes, and
create both a “rhythm” of facade bays or structural elements, and a horizontal
division into a base, middle and top.
               B.   Main building entrances must be prominently featured
through porticos, recessed entrances, lighting, and landscaping. Weather
protection should be provided at all entrances.
               C.   Appropriate building finish materials include: brick

concrete, tile (ceramic or porcelain), glass (clear or lightly tinted),
standing seam metal roofs, slate or imitation slate roof shingles,
architectural asphalt roof shingles, and EIFS (“Dryvit”) as a limited trim
material only.
               D.   Inappropriate, prohibited building finish materials
include: wood, plywood, unfinished concrete or concrete panels, concrete
masonry units, EIFS (“Dryvit”) wall systems, steel or aluminum curtain wall
systems, plastics, reflective glass.
            3.   View Corridor Subdistrict.
               A.   Facades must incorporate three or more vertical planes, and
create both a “rhythm” of facade bays or structural elements, and a horizontal
division into a base, middle and top.
               B.   Main building entrances must be prominently featured
through porticos, recessed entrances, lighting, and landscaping. Weather
protection should be provided at all entrances.
               C.   Appropriate building finish materials include: brick
(clay), natural stone, simulated cut stone, finished (textured and painted)
concrete, finished (textured and painted) pre-cast concrete panels, (subject to

NOTE:   The above requirements do not preclude the establishment of more
stringent restrictions for Conditional Uses or individual permitted uses where
conditions may warrant.
   (A)   Light Industrial (I-1).
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the I-1 District is to encourage the
development of manufacturing and wholesale establishments which are clean,
quiet, and free of hazardous or objectionable elements, operate entirely within
enclosed structures, and generate little industrial traffic. This district is
further designed to act as a transitional use between heavy manufacturing uses
and less intensive uses such as business or residential.
      (2)   Permitted Uses. A complete listing of permitted uses is provided in
Appendix C, Use Matrix. Certain permitted uses have special restrictions listed
in division (A)(3) of this section.
      (3)   Uses Permitted with Restrictions. The following uses are permitted
in this district provided that they meet the restrictions below.
         (a)   Retail Sales. Retail sales shall be permitted as an accessory
use to the primary industrial use, provided such uses are located within the
principal building and occupy no more than 20% of its net floor area.
      (4)   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are permitted when authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals after a public hearing subject to §
159.042. The conditional uses that may be permitted are listed in
Appendix C, Use Matrix.
      (5)   Bulk Requirements. The bulk requirements which apply to all
Industrial Districts are listed within Table 7.
      (6)   Outdoor Storage. Outdoor storage shall be permitted only as an
accessory use to the primary use on the same lot or tract of land.
         (a)   Outdoor storage areas shall not encroach into any minimum
required yard setback, drainage easement, public right-of-way, a fire land,
parking area or maneuvering aisle.
         (b)   All outdoor storage areas shall provide a solid, opaque wall or
fence of not less than seven feet in height measured at the highest finished
grade to screen the view from any adjacent property or right-of-way.
         (c)   All outdoor storage shall be located behind the rear line of the
principal building or structure and shall not front on any public right-of-way.
         (d)   A chain link fence or a variation of a chain link fence
combination shall not constitute an acceptable screening device to satisfy the
requirements of this section.
         (e)   Materials stored behind any screening wall or fence shall be
stacked no higher than one foot below the top of the wall or fence. Vehicles,
trailers, mobile machinery, or equipment shall be stored in their lowest
elevation. No vehicle, trailer, mobile machinery, or equipment shall be used
for nor constitute permanent storage.
         (f)   Maintenance of the wall or fence shall be the responsibility of
the property owner and/or tenant and shall be maintained to create a visual
screen.
      (7)   Fencing. Fencing for either outside storage or fencing of the real
estate shall require that a fence permit be issued prior to installation as set
forth in §
159.121(D)(5)(e).
   (B)   Heavy Industrial (I-2).
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the I-2 District is to encourage the
development of major manufacturing, processing, warehousing, and major research
and testing operations. These activities require extensive community facilities
and reasonably good access to major thoroughfares and the interstate system.
They may also have extensive open storage and service areas and may generate
heavy industrial-type traffic, but shall be prohibited if they create nuisances
beyond the limitations of this chapter.
      (2)   Permitted Uses. A complete listing of permitted uses is provided in
Appendix C, Use Matrix.
      (3)   Uses Permitted with Restrictions. There are currently no permitted
uses in the I-2 district which require special restrictions.
      (4)   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are permitted when authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals after a public hearing subject to §
159.042. The conditional uses that may be permitted are listed in
Appendix C, Use Matrix.
      (5)   Bulk Requirements. The bulk requirements which apply to all
Industrial Districts are listed within Table 7.
      (6)   Fencing. Fencing for either outside storage or fencing of the real
estate shall require that a fence permit be issued prior to installation as set
forth in §
159.121(D)(5)(e).
   (C)   Extractive Industrial (I-3).
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the I-3 District is to provide land for the
mining, excavating, processing, and storage of mineral resources. This district
is designed to assure that these resources be properly managed and that all
land be reclaimed so as not to create a hazard or nuisance which either
immediately or in the future affects the health, safety, or general welfare of
the community. This case would also be of conditional use status. Since what is
now agricultural farmland might one day be exploited as a mineral resource for
extraction, it would require either a rezoning or special exception permit.
Also, after reclamation, a rezoning to a more usable classification would be in
order.
      (2)   Permitted Uses. A complete listing of permitted uses is provided in
Appendix C, Use Matrix. Certain permitted uses have special restrictions listed
in division (C)(3) of this section.
      (3)   Uses Permitted with Restrictions. The following uses are permitted
in this district provided that they meet the restrictions below.
         (a)   Excavation.
            1.   Before any excavation is begun, there shall be a plan on file
with and approved by both the State Department of Natural Resources and the
Plan Commission for both excavation and reclamation activities.
            2.   Any excavation shall be carried on in such a manner so as not
to disturb any land or properties immediately adjacent to the property on which
the excavation is being accomplished. In particular, no excavation shall take
place within 100 feet of the property line.
            3.   Any excavation shall be surrounded by a fence not less than
seven feet high.
            4.   No excavation shall take place by use of explosives.
      (4)   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are permitted when authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals after a public hearing subject to §
159.042. The conditional uses that may be permitted are listed in
Appendix C, Use Matrix.
      (5)   Bulk Requirements. The bulk requirements which apply to all
Commercial Districts are listed within Table 6.
      (6)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage shall be permitted only as an
accessory use to the primary use on the same lot or tract of land.
         (a)   Outdoor storage areas shall not encroach into any minimum
required yard setback, drainage easement, public right-of-way, a fire lane,
parking area or maneuvering aisle.
         (b)   All outdoor storage areas shall provide a solid, opaque wall or
fence including chain-link or vinyl coated chain-link fence with slats of not
less than seven feet in height measured at the highest finished grade to screen
the view from any adjacent property or right-of-way.
         (c)   All outdoor storage shall be located behind the rear line of the
principal building or structure and shall not front on any public right-of-way.
         (d)   Materials stored behind any screening wall or fence shall be
stacked no higher than one foot below the top of the wall or fence. Vehicles,
trailers, mobile machinery, or equipment shall be stored in their lowest
elevation. No vehicle, trailer, mobile machinery, or equipment shall be used
for nor constitute permanent storage.
         (e)   Maintenance of the wall or fence shall be the responsibility of
the property owner and/or tenant and shall be maintained to create a visual
screen.

§ 159.109 SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Flood Hazard (FH) District.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the Flood Hazard (FH) District is to guide
development in flood hazard areas. The flood hazard areas of the city are
subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-1-4-11
granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council, in order to minimize the threat
of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
      It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
         (a)   Protect human life and health;
         (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in floodplains;
         (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-
blight areas;
         (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
         (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
         (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
         (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
         (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
         (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish their
purposes, these regulations include methods and provisions for:
         (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
         (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers that help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
         (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development that may increase flood damage; and,
         (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
will unnaturally divert floodwaters, or that may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (3)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter shall
apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the
city, including any additional areas of special flood hazard within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or areas annexed by the city over
time.
         (a)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
the studied Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the
city, delineated as an “AE Zone”, shall be determined by the 1% annual chance
flood profiles in the Hamilton County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Study (FIS), and corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), dated November
14, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. Should the
floodway limits not be delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for a studied
SFHA designated as an “AE Zone”, the limits of the floodway will be according
to the best available layer as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (b)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for
each of the SFHAs delineated as a “Zone A” on the FIRM of Hamilton County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and dated November 19, 2014, as well as any subsequent updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a
party disagrees with the best available flood layer, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
         (c)   In the absence of a published FEMA map or the absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood-prone areas
shall be according to the best available flood layer as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
         (d)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective, less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
         (e)   The FH zoning district is established based upon the boundaries
of the Special Flood Hazard Areas as shown on the FIRM for Hamilton County,
Indiana, and Incorporated Areas. Those areas shown by the best available flood
layer to be within the SFHA but not yet shown on an FIRM shall be subject to
the regulations of this FH zoning district.
         (f)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground
elevations.
            1.   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) with base flood elevations provided (riverine or lacustrine
Zone AE) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided
on the profiles or table of still water elevations shall govern.
            2.   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.
            3.   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is at
or above the base flood elevation and a LOMA or LOMR-FW is obtained, the
floodplain regulations will not be applied, provided the LOMA or LOMR-FW is not
subsequently superseded or invalidated.
      (4)   Administration.
         (a)   The Director of Planning (or his or her designee) shall be the
Floodplain Administrator charged with the administration and implementation of
the provisions of this chapter. The Floodplain Administrator and/or designated
staff is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
         (b)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but are not limited to:
            1.   Evaluate applications for permits to develop in Special Flood
Hazard Areas to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied.
            2.   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and
flood protection elevation information.
            3.   Issue permits to develop in Special Flood Hazard Areas when
the provisions of these regulations have been met or deny the permit
application in the event of noncompliance.
            4.   Advise the permittee that additional federal, state, and/or
local permits may be required. If specific federal, state, and/or local permits
are necessary, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained
on file with the floodplain development permit.
            5.   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas identified
by FEMA and damaged from any source, must meet the development standards of
these regulations.
            6.   For applications to improve structures, including alterations,
movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvements or work on such building and structures, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
               a.   Verify and document the market value of the pre-damaged or
pre-improved structure;
               b.   Compare the cost to perform the improvements; or the cost
to repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition; or the combined
costs of improvements and repair, if applicable, to the market value of the
pre-damaged or pre-improved structure. The cost of all work must be included in
the project costs, including work that might otherwise be considered routine
maintenance. Items/activities that must be included in the cost shall be in
keeping with guidance published by FEMA to ensure compliance with the NFIP and
to avoid any conflict with future flood insurance claims of policyholders
within the community;
               c.   Determine and document whether the proposed work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the
determination requires evaluations of previous permits issued for improvements
and repairs as specified in the definition of “substantial improvement” for
proposed work to repair damage caused by flood and previous permits issued to
repair flood-related damage as specified in the definition of “substantial
damage”; and
               d.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the applicable general and specific standards of this chapter
are required.
            7.   Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for all development projects within the
floodway as further described in this chapter, and maintain a record of the
authorization with either a copy of the permit/authorization or a copy of the
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment.
            8.   Verify the upstream drainage area of any proposed development
site near any watercourse not identified on a FEMA map to determine if a
construction authorization is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for development projects within the floodway as described further in
this chapter. Maintain a record of the authorization (a copy of the actual
permit/authorization or a copy of the floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment).
            9.   Coordinate with insurance adjusters prior to permitting any
proposed work to bring any flood-damaged structure covered by a standard flood
insurance policy into compliance (either a substantially-damaged structure or a
repetitive-loss structure) to ensure eligibility for ICC funds.
            10.   Notify adjacent communities and the State Floodplain
Coordinator prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
copies of these notifications to FEMA.
            11.   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request local
permit documents, damaged structure inventories, substantial damage
determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, Letters of Map Change (LOMC),
copies of DNR permits, letters of authorization, and floodplain analysis and
regulatory assessments (letters of recommendation), federal permit documents,
and as-built elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed
subject to this chapter.
            12.   Utilize and enforce all LOMC or Physical Map Revisions (PMR)
issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the community.
            13.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of a watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
            14.   Ensure that an approved connection to a public sewer system
or an approved onsite septic system is planned for any structures (residential
or non-residential) to be equipped with a restroom, a kitchen or other
facilities requiring disposal of wastewater.
            15.   Verify and record the actual elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with the requirements of this division (A).
            16.   Verify and record the actual elevation to which any new or
substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter.
            17.   Provide information, testimony, or other evidence as needed
during variance hearings.
            18.   Service notices of violations, issue stop work orders, revoke
permits and take corrective actions in accordance with division (A)(27).
            19.   Coordinate map maintenance activities and associated FEMA
follow-up as further detailed in this chapter.
            20.   As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the Floodplain
Administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to
ensure that the work is done according to the provisions of the local ordinance
and terms of the permit. The Floodplain Administrator shall have the right,
upon presentation of proper credential, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
            21.   Once a project is complete, periodic inspections may be
conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The Floodplain
Administrator shall have the right, upon presentation of proper credential, to
enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at
any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
            22.   Request any additional information that may be necessary to
determine the nature of a proposed development or structure with respect to the
requirements of this chapter.
            23.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees), submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
         (c)   Floodplain management records.
            1.   Regardless of any other law or ordinance on the period
required for retention of public records, records of actions associated with
the administration of these floodplain regulations shall be kept on file and
maintained under the direction of the Floodplain Administrator in perpetuity.
These records shall include permit applications, plans, certifications, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Letters of Map Change, records of issuance of permits and
denial of permits, determinations of whether proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, required design
certifications and documentation of elevations required by this chapter,
notifications to adjacent communities, FEMA, and the state related to
alterations of watercourses, assurances that the flood-carrying capacity of
altered watercourses will be maintained, documentation related to appeals and
variances, including justification for issuance or denial, and records of
enforcement actions taken pursuant to this chapter.
            2.   These records shall be available for public inspection at
Noblesville City Hall, 16 South 10th Street, Noblesville, IN 46060.
         (d)   The Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter that are consistent with its spirit and
purpose. In addition to the provisions for appeals contained in §
159.043(B), the provisions of this division (A) shall be applied in the
following manner for the interpretation and application of provisions:
            1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
            2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
            3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (5)   Approval procedures.
         (a)   Any alterations to sites and existing structures within the FH
District must appear before the Board of Zoning Appeals for approval before any
construction or alteration of the site may begin. The only exceptions to this
requirement are those sites that are rezoned by the Common Council to allow
fill or cut-and-fill operations or additions to existing structures that do not
increase the footprint of the structure and that are located above the BFE.
         (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   No applicant shall proceed with any fill or cut-and-fill
operations without receiving rezoning approval from the Plan Commission and
Common Council. See §
159.109(A)(8) for further requirements.
         (d)   All projects shall be required to receive a building permit or
improvement location permit prior to the beginning of any development on the
project.
      (6)   Improvement location permit.
         (a)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted
by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining
an improvement location permit from the Director. The Director shall not issue
an improvement location permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter after review by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (b)   The application for an improvement location permit shall include
all applicable information that is required by §§
159.040 et seq. and
Appendix B of this chapter.
         (c)   Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location
permit, the Director shall determine if the site is located within an
identified floodway, floodway fringe, or within the floodplain where the limits
of the floodway have not yet been determined. If in an identified floodway,
floodway fringe, or within a floodplain where the limits have not been
determined, the Director shall forward the application to the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   Floodways
               a.   If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural
Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the
provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities,
such as filling, grading, clearing, paving, and any other similar activities
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building. General
licenses and exemptions to the requirements of the Flood Control Act (I.C. 14-
28-1 and 312 I.A.C. 10) may apply to qualified additions or improvements to
existing lawful residential structures, rural bridges, logjam removals, wetland
restoration, utility line crossings, outfall projects, creek rock removal, and
prospecting.
               b.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until a permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission, granting
approval for construction in the floodway, or evidence provided by an applicant
that the development meets specified criteria to qualify for a general license
or exemption to the requirement of the Flood Control Act. Once a permit has
been issued by the Natural Resources Commission, the Director may issue the
local improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in this
division (A) have been met.
               c.   The improvement location permit cannot be less restrictive
than an approval issued for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, or the specified criteria used to qualify for
a general license or exemption to the Flood Control Act for a specific site or
project. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
               d.   In floodway area identified on the FIRM, development shall
cause no increase in flood level during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge without first obtaining a conditional letter of map revision. A
conditional letter of map revision cannot be issued for development that would
cause an increase in flood levels affecting a structure and such development
should not be permitted.
               e.   In floodway areas identified by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources through detailed or approximate studies, but not yet
identified on the effective FIRM as floodway areas, the total cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not adversely affect the efficiency of, or
unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This “ADVERSE EFFECT” is defined
as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-
hundredths (0.15) of a foot, as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
            2.   Fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe (either
identified on the FIRM or identified by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources through detailed or approximate studies not identified on a FIRM),
then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local improvement location
permit provided the provisions of this division (A) have been met.
            3.   SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways or fringes.
               a.   When the drainage area upstream of a site is greater than
one square mile and the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment. No action shall be taken by the Floodplain
Administrator until written approval from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources (approval for construction in a floodway, letter of authorization, or
evidence of general license qualification) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended
flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development,
an improvement location permit may be issued, provided the conditions of the
improvement location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions contained
in this division (A) have been met.
               b.   When the drainage area upstream of a site is less than one
square mile and the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not been determined, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis
showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for
the site. Upon receipt of the information, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue the improvement location permit, provided the provisions of this division
(A) have been met.
            4.   SFHAs not identified on a map.
               a.   If a proposed development is near a waterway with no SFHA
identified on a map, the Floodplain Administrator shall verify the drainage
area upstream of the site. If the drainage area upstream of the site is
verified as being greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review. No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit or written approval from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources (approval for construction in the a floodway, letter of
authorization, or evidence of general license qualification) or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation, 1% annual
chance flood elevation, and the recommended flood protection grade has been
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Once the Floodplain
Administrator has received the proper permit or floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment approving the proposed development, an improvement location permit
may be issued, provided the conditions of the improvement location permit are
not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Department of
Natural Resources, and the provisions of this division (A) have been met.
               b.   When the drainage area upstream of a site is less than one
square mile and the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and floodway fringe have not been determined, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis,
showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for
the site. Upon receipt of the information, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue the improvement location permit, provided the provisions of this division
(A) have been met.
         (d)   Upon establishment or placement of the lowest floor, it shall be
the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator an
elevation certificate for the building under construction. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the elevation certificate. Any deficiencies detected
during the review shall be corrected by the applicant before work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make the corrections
required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project.
         (e)   Upon completion of construction of any structure requiring a
certification of elevation, an elevation certification depicting the as-built
lowest floor elevation and other applicable elevation data is required to be
submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator. The elevation
certificate shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered land
surveyor and certified by the same.
         (f)   Upon completion of construction of an elevated structure
constructed on fill, a fill report is required to be submitted to the
Floodplain Administrator to verify the required standards were met, including
compaction.
         (g)   Upon the completion of construction of a floodproofing measure,
a floodproofing certificate is required to be submitted by the applicant to the
Floodplain Administrator. The floodproofing certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer or architect
and certified by the same.
      (7)   Permitted uses. A complete listing of permitted uses is provided in
Appendix C, Use Matrix. Certain permitted uses have special restrictions listed
in division (A(8) below.
      (8)   Excavation as a permitted use with restrictions. Excavation is
permitted in this district provided it meets the following restrictions.
         (a)   Before any excavation is begun, there shall be a plan on file
with and approved by both the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, if
located within the floodway, and the Plan Commission for both excavation and
reclamation activities.
         (b)   Any excavation shall be carried on in such a manner so as not to
disturb any land or properties immediately adjacent to the property on which
the excavation is being accomplished. In particular, no excavation shall take
place within 100 feet of the property line.
         (c)   Any excavation shall be surrounded by a fence not less than
seven feet in height.
         (d)   No excavation shall take place by use of explosives.
      (9)   Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in this
district.
         (a)   Cut and fill. Cut and fill is prohibited within the Flood Hazard
District. These regulations prohibit the placement of fill within the FH zoning
district. However, in rare circumstances, when it is not possible to avoid fill
within the floodplain, the applicant may seek a waiver of the prohibition. The
waiver of this prohibition must be received with a request to rezone the
property, and both requests must be approved by the Plan Commission and City
Council. No changes will be approved without compliance with the following
requirements:
            1.   Compensatory storage is required for any fill, structure, or
other material above the grade in the regulatory floodplain that temporarily or
permanently displaces floodplain storage volume.
            2.   Compensatory storage must:
               a.   Be equal to at least three times the volume of flood
storage lost below the ten-year and 100-year flood elevations.
               b.   Be operational prior to placement of fill, structures, or
other materials temporarily or permanently placed in the regulatory floodplain.
               c.   Be provided in addition to the site detention volume.
               d.   Drain freely and openly to the waterway.
            3.   All regulatory floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-
year flood elevation shall be compensated for below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation.
            4.   All regulatory floodplain storage lost below the existing,
regulatory ten-year flood elevation shall be compensated for above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation.
         (b)   A restrictive covenant, which states the approved compensatory
cut area (excavation) shall not be altered without approval from the Floodplain
Administrator, shall be executed and recorded in the County Recorder’s Office,
using a document cross-reference number that references the property in
question.
         (c)   Cut-and-fill projects must be protected against erosion and
scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If
vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical.
         (d)   Fill. Filling a property using materials from an outside source
that does not provide an area of compensatory storage within the watershed is
prohibited.
      (10)   Conditional uses. Conditional uses are permitted when authorized
by the Board of Zoning Appeals after a public hearing subject to §
159.042. The conditional uses that may be permitted are listed in
Appendix C, Use Matrix. Certain conditional uses have special restrictions that
are listed below. In the floodway, no conditional use shall be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless a permit for construction has previously been
obtained from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. The Board may impose
greater restrictions than those required by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
         (a)   Campgrounds.
            1.   Approval must be obtained from the Indiana State Board of
Health and from the Department of Natural Resources.
            2.   The size, procedure, design, installation, and maintenance for
Recreational Campgrounds shall be provided for in §
159.106(G), Residential Mobile Home Park (RMH) District.
      (11)   Bulk requirements. The bulk requirements that apply to the FH
District shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Director of
Planning and Development. The Director should take into account the standards
for the adjoining zoning districts as well as the existing pattern of
development in the immediate area of the construction when determining the
setbacks.
      (12)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following are required:
         (a)   New construction, reconstruction or repairs to a repetitive-loss
structure and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
         (b)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         (c)   All structures shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials
below the FPG.
         (d)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at or above the FPG
for residential structures. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be located at or
above the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components below the FPG for non-residential structures. Water and
sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other
waterproofed service facilities may be located below the FPG.
         (e)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         (f)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         (g)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
         (h)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other development, affecting any part of the area of the development.
         (i)   Construction of new solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous
waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities
shall not be permitted in areas of special flood hazard.
         (j)   Parking lots, driveways, and sidewalks within the SFHA shall be
constructed with permeable materials.
         (k)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a
structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
Any structure in the SFHA that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter may not be altered, repaired, reconstructed, or improved unless the
changes are in compliance with these regulations. The only exception to this is
a repair or alteration that does not increase the footprint of the existing
structure and does not total more than 40% of its pre-repair fair market value.
         (l)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for construction
of a new structure, the volume of space that will be occupied by the structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of
excavation taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal
to three times the volume of storage lost due to the structure.
            1.   The excavation shall take place on the same property on which
the structure is located within the same floodplain, provided sufficient space
exists. If sufficient space does not exist on the same property, the excavation
shall take place in the same floodplain no further than 1,000 feet from the
site of the structure, provided authorization or permission has been granted by
the owners of any property where the excavation is proposed.
            2.   A restrictive covenant that runs with the property, which
states the approved compensatory cut area (the excavation) shall not be altered
without approval from the Floodplain Administrator, shall be executed and
recorded in the Hamilton County Recorder's Office.
            3.   The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater
but shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater.
            4.   The excavation shall be sufficiently stabilized and compacted
to remain firm and resist erosion.
            5.   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to other regulatory floodwater.
            6.   The structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading to the
floodplain.
            7.   The structure shall be of a material deemed stable enough to
remain firm and in place during periods of flooding, and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement.
            8.   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated shall be submitted
prior to the start of construction or site work. Once site work is complete,
but prior to the start of construction on any structure, the applicant shall
provide the Floodplain Administrator with a certified survey of the excavation
demonstrating that the excavation complies with this division (A).
      (13)   Building protection requirement. In addition to the general
standards described above, all structures located in the SFHA shall be
protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement
applies to the following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of a residential structure.
         (b)   Construction or placement of a non-residential structure.
         (c)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure where the
cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 40% of the market value
of the existing structure, excluding the value of land.
         (d)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition equals or
exceeds 40% of the market value of the structure, excluding the value of the
land, before damage occurred. The costs of any proposed additions or
improvements beyond restoring the damaged structure to its before-damaged
condition must be included in the cost.
         (e)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days.
         (f)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site.
         (g)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive-loss structure.
         (h)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure with a
previous repair, addition, or improvement constructed since the community’s
first floodplain ordinance.
      (14)   Residential construction (excluding manufactured homes).
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall meet all the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   In Zone A and Zone AE, new construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, at or above the FPG.
         (c)   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior
walls below the FPG shall meet the following requirements:
            1.   Must be designed to preclude finished living space. Must be
designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Flood openings must be designed and
installed in compliance with criteria set out in FEMA Technical Bulletin 1.
Engineered flood openings must be designed and certified by a registered design
professional and require supporting engineering certification or make- or
model-specific ICC-ES Report, or they must meet the following criteria for non-
engineered flood openings:
               a.   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of an
enclosure. If more than one enclosed area is present, each must have openings
on exterior walls, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot
above the higher of the final interior grade or floor and the finished exterior
grade immediately under each opening.
               c.   If the floor of the enclosure is below the BFE, the
openings must be located wholly below the BFE.
               d.   If the floor of the enclosure is at or above the BFE, but
below the FPG, the openings must be located wholly below the FPG.
               e.   Doors and windows do not qualify as openings.
               f.   Openings must be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
            2.   Where the interior height of the enclosure exceeds six feet,
the property owner shall execute and record with the structure’s deed a non-
conversion agreement, declaring that the area below the lowest floor or the
detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished, or otherwise
converted to living space, and the city will have the right to inspect the

within parks or other public grounds.
      (21)   Nonconforming uses. Uses legally existing in the FH District as of
the effective date of this chapter shall be considered legal nonconforming
uses. After determination of the value of the proposed alteration or
enlargement subject to the criteria laid out in §
159.109(A)(4)b.6., the following shall apply:
         (a)   No nonconforming use in the FH District and located in an
identified floodway may be altered or enlarged without a permit for
construction in a floodway from Natural Resources.
         (b)   A nonconforming use in a FH District may be altered, enlarged,
or extended, on a one time only basis, provided the alteration, enlargement, or
extension does not increase the value of the building or structure, excluding
the value of land, by more than 40% of its pre-improvement market value, unless
the building or structure is permanently changed to a conforming use.
         (c)   Any nonconforming use in the FH District that is damaged by
flood, fire, explosion Act of God, or the public enemy may be restored to its
original dimensions and conditions, provided the cost of the repair does not
exceed more than 40% of the pre-damage assessment, excluding the value of the
land.
         (d)   Such uses may be granted variances subject to the provisions of
§
159.043, but may require additional notice requirements beyond those required
for uses in other districts.
      (22)   Map maintenance activities. To meet NFIP minimum requirements to
have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the city
flood maps, studies, and other data accurately represent flooding conditions so
appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the
following map maintenance activities are identified:
         (a)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
            1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months
of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
               a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the Special
Flood Hazard Area;
               c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the Special Flood Hazard Area, including the placement of
culverts; and subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations.
            2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have required
technical data for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or a Letter of Map
Revisions and submitted to FEMA. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources
will review the submittals as part of a partnership with FEMA. The submittal
should be mailed to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at the address
provided on the FEMA application forms for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
or a Letter of Map Revisions (MT-2) or submitted through the online letter of
map change website. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
            3.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a flood development permit for
proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation.
            4.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this section.
         (b)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor and may be
submitted to FEMA at any time.
         (c)   Annexation or detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the Hamilton County, Indiana,
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the city
boundaries, within such notification shall be included a copy of a map of the
city suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the
new area for which the city has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      (23)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood
protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of
the city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
      (24)   Compliance.
         (a)   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.
         (b)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the most conservative
(highest) base flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed
structure; or for other developments affecting any part of the area of the
development.
         (c)   No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
      (25)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This division (A) is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this division and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (26)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
         (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
         (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (27)   Violations. Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter,
obtain a permit, comply with the requirements of a permit, or conditions of a
variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All violations
shall be considered a common nuisance subject to the remedies described in §
159.999. Planning staff shall inform the owner in the written notice that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
         (a)   Stop work orders.
            1.   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any
building, structure, or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease.
            2.   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property, to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work,
and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
         (b)   Revocation of permits.
            1.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in cases where there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
            2.   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving,
demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit
was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of
this chapter.
   (B)   Zero Lot Line (ZLL) Overlay.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the ZLL Zero Lot Line District is to
accommodate this unique form of development for smaller families and affordable
living as recommended by the Comprehensive Plan. ZLL Districts may be
appropriate in developed areas and for unusual parcels, as further described
below. There is no guarantee that approval of a ZLL development will be
granted. The Commission may deny a ZLL request that is not consistent or
compatible with the surrounding uses and/or that the health, safety, or general
welfare of the immediate neighborhood or community is at risk. The principal
purposes of the Zero Lot Line (ZLL) District are:
         (a)   To support a more efficient use of land, as compared with the
typical single family development, making available needed housing at a more
affordable cost;
         (b)   To encourage the design of dwellings that integrate and relate
internal-external living areas resulting in more pleasant and enjoyable living
facilities; by placing the dwelling against one of the property lines,
permitting the outdoor space to be grouped and utilized to its maximum benefit;
         (c)   To promote scattered ZLL developments and not to isolate all ZLL
in a single area;
         (d)   To utilize ZLL to infill existing areas.
      (2)   Location.
         (a)   District in Which Permitted. A Zero Lot Line development
district (ZLL) for one-family dwellings only, may be permitted in the R-1, R-2,
R-3, R-4, and R-5 districts as an overlay district if approved by the Plan
Commission and Common Council following a public hearing subject to §
159.044.
         (b)   Other Locational Criteria. In addition to division (B)(2)(a) of
this section, the location of Zero Lot Line developments shall be guided by the
following criteria. Such districts shall:
            1.   Be located in an urbanized area where sanitary sewer service
and public water supply is available;
            2.   Provide common open space on site for the occupants of the
project or to contribute land or fees in lieu of land to the governmental unit
of jurisdiction;
            3.   Provide landscaping not normally provided in conventional
residential developments;
            4.   Be located on sites no more than ten acres; provided, however,
that larger ZLL developments may be allowed provided recreational facilities
are included within the development.
      (3)   Uses.
         (a)   Single Family Detached Dwellings on individually platted lots
shall be permitted.
         (b)   All dwelling units shall have at least a one car attached
garage.
         (c)   Detached accessory structures of any kind shall not be
permitted.
         (d)   Carports and utility storage structures shall be permitted
accessory uses if connected to the principal structure and the required side
and rear setbacks are followed.
         (e)   Fencing, walls, trellises, and other similar uses may be used as
connecting elements between one-family dwellings on adjacent lots, subject to
Site Plan Review.
      (4)   Bulk Requirements.
         (a)   Minimum Tract Sizes. The minimum tract size shall be five acres.
Usable or buildable space of any individual tract shall be 75% of the total
tract area. (Lake areas may be included in the required tract sizes; however,
the lake area will not be included in determining buildable tract size.)
         (b)   Maximum Density and Dwelling Unit Size. The maximum density is
based upon which district the Zero Lot Line project is proposed. In the R-
1 district, 4.48 units per acre are permitted; in the R-2 district, 5.35 units
per acre; in the R-3 district, 6.05 units per acre; in the R-4 and R-
5 districts, 7.25 units per acre are permitted. Arrangement of the units is
somewhat flexible, however, no individual lot may be smaller than 5,000 square
feet. Private streets, open spaces, recreation areas or bodies of water shall
not be used in calculating the net lot area. Dwelling unit sizes shall be
similar to the adjacent development but in no instance less than required by
the base zoning district.
         (c)   Lot Width. The minimum lot width for one-family dwellings shall
be 40 feet, except for corner lots where the minimum lot width shall be 50
feet.
         (d)   Setbacks.
            1.   Front Yard or Corner Side Yard. All dwelling structures shall
be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the property line.
            2.   Rear Yard Adjacent to other ZLL Development. There shall be a
minimum rear setback of ten feet.
            3.   Interior Side Yard Adjacent to other ZLL Development. The
dwelling unit shall be placed on one interior side property line with a zero
setback, and the dwelling unit setback on the other interior side property line
shall be a minimum of ten feet, excluding the connecting elements such as
fences, walls, and trellises. Patios, pools, garden features and other similar
elements shall be permitted within the ten foot setback area, provided,
however, no structure with the exception of fences or walls, shall be placed
within easements required by §
159.082(B). No zero yard is allowed against a perimeter yard or against a
public right-of-way.
            4.   Side or Rear Yard Adjacent to Conventional Development. Where
a ZLL development is adjacent to a conventional subdivision, no structure shall
be closer than 25 feet to the adjacent lot line.
         (e)   Maximum Lot Coverage. The total lot coverage permitted for all
buildings on a site shall not exceed 50% of the lot area, including accessory
uses.
         (f)   Building Height. The maximum building height shall not exceed
two stories and 35 feet in height.
      (5)   Procedure for a ZLL District.
         (a)   Application. Applications for a Zero Lot Line Development shall
be filed in accordance with the requirements of §
159.040.
         (b)   Site Plan Review. Applications for a Zero Lot Line Development
shall be subject to site plan review pursuant to §
159.041. The purpose of the site plan review is to encourage logic,
imagination, innovation and variety in the design process and insure the
congruity of the proposed development and its compatibility with the
surrounding area.
         (c)   Site Plan Review Criteria. The following criteria shall be
considered for the Site Plan review of ZLL Districts:
            1.   Planning Studies. Planning studies approved by the Plan
Commission that include development patterns or environmental and other design
criteria shall be utilized in the plan review process.
            2.   Definition of Private Outdoor Living Spaces. The Zero Lot Line
unit shall be designed to integrate interior and exterior living areas. The
configuration of the exterior walls of the unit shall define and enclose and/or
partially enclose outdoor living areas.
            3.   Landscape. Landscape shall be preserved in its natural state
insofar as is practical by minimizing removal of existing vegetation.
Landscaping shall be used to shade and cool, direct wind movements, enhance
architectural features, relating structure design to the site, visually screen
non-compatible uses, and ameliorate the impact of noise.
            4.   Buffers. Architectural and/or landscape elements that provide
a logical transition to adjoining, existing, or permitted uses shall be
provided.
            5.   Energy Conservation. Design methods to reduce energy
consumption is encouraged. Energy conservation methods may include, but not be
limited to, natural ventilation of structures, siting of structures in relation
to prevailing breezes and sun angles, insulation of structures, use of
landscape materials for shade and transpiration, and orientation of breezes.
            6.   Graphics. Outdoor graphics shall be designed as an integral
part of the overall design of the project.
            7.   Visual Access. Visual access shall be provided for the driver
of an automobile backing out of the individual lot into the adjacent roadway.
Dwelling units on corner lots shall be so situated and set back as to provide
unobstructed visual clearance at a roadway intersection.
            8.   Private Open Space. Open space intended for the private use of
each individual dwelling unit should be so located and designed as to maximize
its utility to the dwelling unit it serves and maximize its privacy, especially
in relation to adjacent dwelling units.
            9.   Trash Containers. Trash containers shall be screened and so
designed as to be conveniently accessible to their users and collectors.
            10.   Visual monotony created by excessive block lengths shall be
avoided.
         (d)   Commencement of Development. Development may not commence until
after final approval of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is received. If
development is not commenced within 12 months from the date of approval of a
site development plan, the approval thereof shall become null and void and the
same may not be developed in accordance with said plan; provided, if
development is permitted in stages, subsequent stages may be commenced within
18 months after the completion of the previous stage; otherwise, such
subsequent stage may not be developed in accordance with the previously
approved plan and such approval shall be null and void. Commencement of
construction shall include but not be limited to active and continuous road
improvement, excavation, grading and leveling, installation of utilities and
the like.
      (6)   Additional Requirements.
         (a)   Platting Requirements. Each dwelling shall be located on its own
individual platted lot. If areas for common use of occupants of the development
are shown on the plat, satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the
maintenance of the common open space and facilities as provided in division (B)
(6)(e) of this section. The plat shall indicate the zero lot lines and
easements appurtenant thereto.
         (b)   Openings Prohibited on Zero Lot Line Side. The wall of the
dwelling located on the lot line shall have no windows, doors, air conditioning
units or any other type of openings, provided, however, that atriums or courts
shall be permitted on the zero lot line side when the court or atrium is
enclosed by three walls of the dwelling unit and a solid wall of at least eight
feet in height is provided on the zero lot line. Said wall shall be constructed
of the same material as exterior walls of the unit.
         (c)   Maintenance and Drainage Easements. A perpetual four foot wall
maintenance easement shall be provided on the lot adjacent to the zero lot
property line, which, with the exception of walls and/or fences, shall be kept
clear of structures. This easement shall be shown on the plat and incorporated
into each deed transferring title to the property. The wall shall be maintained
in its original color and treatment unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the two affected lot owners. Roof overhangs may penetrate the easement on the
adjacent lot a maximum of 24 inches, but the roof shall be so designed that the
water runoff from the dwelling placed on the lot line is limited to the
easement area.
         (d)   Trees. Yard trees shall be provided on the basis of three trees
for each platted lot. In addition, street shade trees shall be provided along
each side of the roadways at a minimum spacing of 40 feet on center for private
roads. In case of developments with public roads, the trees may be placed on
private lots in lieu of the public right-of-way provided the 40 foot spacing
and the rowing of trees are maintained. This shall be in addition to the three
trees required for each platted lot. Existing trees shall be preserved to the
maximum extent practical and shall count towards meeting the total tree
requirements. Removal of any existing trees shall be in accordance with the
approval directives of the Plan Commission.
         (e)   Common Open Space and Maintenance of Facilities. Common open
space is not always required, unless the development is larger than ten acres
in size, see §
159.121(A), but is permitted and encouraged. Where the development is larger
than ten acres, the required open space shall include a recreational area
consisting of at least two of the following:
            1.   A playground area with equipment;
            2.   A tennis court;
            3.   A basketball court;
            4.   A swimming pool.
Where common open space is provided, provisions satisfactory to the Plan
Commission shall be made to assure that non-public areas and facilities for the
common use of occupants of Zero Lot Line development shall be maintained in a
satisfactory manner, without expense to the general taxpayer of the city or its
zoning jurisdiction. Such may be provided by the incorporation of an automatic
membership home association for the purpose of continually holding title to
such non-public areas and facilities and levying assessments against each lot,
whether improved or not, for the purpose of paying the taxes and maintaining
such common open space.
Such assessments shall be a lien superior to all other liens save and except
tax liens and first mortgage liens, which are amortized in monthly or quarter
annual payments over a period of not less than ten years. Other methods may be
acceptable if the same positively provide for the proper and continuous payment
of taxes and maintenance without expense to the general taxpayers. The
instrument incorporating such provisions shall be approved by the Plan
Commission Attorney as to form and legal sufficiency, before submission to the
Board of Public Works and Safety or the County Commissioners, and it shall be
recorded in the public records of Hamilton County, if satisfactory to the Board
of Works or the County Commissioners.
         (f)   Drainage. On-site storm water detention or retention is
mandatory, but facilities may be shared.
   (C)   Historic Preservation (HP) Overlay District.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the Historic Preservation Overlay District
(HPO) is to further the purposes of this chapter and of the Comprehensive Plan
by preserving buildings which are important to the education, culture,
traditions and economic values of the city and to the rehabilitation,
conservation and redevelopment of the Downtown District, and to afford the
city, interested persons, historical societies, or organizations the
opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of such buildings.
This chapter promotes the conservation, protection, restoration,
rehabilitation, use, and overall enhancement of historic structures, sites, and
districts within the city and provides regulatory protection to areas of the
city that compliments, but does not supersede the contents of the underlying
zoning district.
      (2)   District Requirements. The permitted and conditional uses and bulk
regulations for all Historic Preservation Overlay Districts shall be pursuant
to the underlying zoning district. Any application for new construction,
additions, or alterations of a structure in an Historic Preservation Overlay
District must complete a site plan review process as described in § 159.041.
      (3)   Procedure for HPO District. A Historic Preservation Overlay
District may be created by either of the following means.
         (a)   The Common Council may designate an area as an Historic
Preservation District upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, following
the adoption of a study delineating the historic resource area.
         (b)   The petition by more than 50% of the property owners in a
proposed district shall cause the Common Council to consider an overlay for the
area petitioned, pursuant to § 159.044.
      (4)   Site Plan Review Criteria. The following criteria shall be
considered for any Site Plan Review in the HPO District:
         (a)   Massing. The massing of the building shall be regulated by the
Floor Area Ratio standards found in the underlying zoning district.
         (b)   Height. The height of a proposed building shall be regulated by
the underlying zoning district.
         (c)   Proportion of building’s front facade. The relationship of the
height of a building to its width at the front elevation shall be the same as
currently exists within the district.
         (d)   Proportion of openings within the structure. The width of a
window and its height shall match that currently existing within the district.
         (e)   Rhythm of buildings along street. The relationship of a building
to open space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible
to the buildings currently existing within the district.
         (f)   Porches, entrances, and porch projections. In districts where
porches, door platforms or steps, exterior stairs or decks, or roof-walks and
platforms are a characteristic element of building design, these must be
incorporated into the new design. Porches must be at least four feet deep. A
projection less than four feet in depth will be considered a door platform.
         (g)   Materials and Texture. The materials and textures used in the
design must be the same as those that predominate in the district. This applies
to roofs, wall surfaces, and foundations.
         (h)   Roof Shapes. The roof shape of a building must be that which
predominates in the district. This shall apply to the shape, pitch, overhang,
dormers, skylights, and chimneys.
         (i)   Trims and Miscellaneous Details. The trim and miscellaneous
details of a building must be that which predominates in the district. This
shall apply to the trim, gutters and leaders, louvers, vents, house lights, and
public utilities.
         (j)   Garages, other accessory buildings. In residential districts,
all garages must be detached and located at the rear property line.
      (5)   Demolition. Upon the receipt of an application for the demolition
of any structure within an Historic Preservation Overlay District, the Director
of Planning and Development will send public notice to the property owners
within the district and to the Indiana Historic Preservation Agency.
   (D)   Planned Development (PD) Overlay Districts.
      (1)   Purpose. This district is intended to provide flexibility in
specific locations for development which is in the public interest and would
not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this chapter. Such flexibility is
provided to achieve certain comprehensive plan policies, accommodate rapid
changes in design and technology in the construction industry, and address new
and varied demands in the housing and commercial markets, all in a manner that
will be consistent with the objectives of the City and the Townships. This
district is further intended to:
         (a)   Encourage a more creative approach in land and building site
planning.
         (b)   Encourage an efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open
space.
         (c)   Promote variety in the physical development pattern of the
community.
         (d)   Achieve flexibility and provide incentives for development which
will produce a wider range of choice in satisfying the changing urban needs.
         (e)   Encourage renewal of older areas where new development and
restoration are needed to revitalize the area.
         (f)   Permit special consideration of property with unique features,
such as historical significance, unusual topography, landscape amenities, size,
and shape.
         (g)   Recapture bypassed land so poorly planned and developed as to be
a public liability.
         (h)   Simplify processing of development proposals for developers and
the Commission by providing for concurrent review of land use, subdivision,
public improvements, and site considerations.
      (2)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall only apply to
new development proposals. It shall not apply to any Planned Development Plan
which is now fully or partially developed, nor to any such development for
which a final authorization has been granted pursuant to a previous ordinance,
provided, however, that a petitioner may, upon application and approval of the
Commission, become subject to all the benefits and requirements of this
section, subject to such rights as shall have vested in the owners of the area
affected by development under said ordinance.
      (3)   Limitations on Flexibility of Planned Developments. It is not
intended that the city automatically grant the initial plan of development
proposed by a petitioner. The City Plan Commission shall approve only such
plans of development which are consistent with the public benefits resulting
from the planned development. Therefore, the City Plan Commission may require
as a condition of approval and subsequent amendment of the zoning map, any
reasonable condition, limitation or design factor which will promote proper
development of a Planned Development.
      (4)   Classes of Planned Development Districts and Uses Permitted. This
chapter provides for the following four classes of Planned Development
Districts:
         (a)   To designate a parcel of real property as a Planned Development
(PD) including the underlying zoning district;
         (b)   To specify uses or a range of uses permitted in the Planned
Development District;
         (c)   To specify development requirements in the Planned Development
District;
         (d)   To specify the documentation including an overall plan and
supporting documents;
         (e)   To specify any limitation(s) applicable to the Planned
Development District; and
         (f)   To specify any variation(s) from the underlying zoning district
requirements.
      (5)   Minimum Size of District. No district shall be established unless
it contains the minimum area specified below:
         (a)   Residential Planned Development: Five acres.
         (b)   Mixed Use Planned Development: Ten acres.
         (c)   Commercial Planned Development: Three acres.
         (d)   Industrial Planned Development: Five acres.
      (6)   Development Standards. A proposed Planned Development Plan shall be
designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable character in keeping
with the principles of good neighborhood design, and must provide standards of
open space, efficiency in street patterns, and areas for parking adequate for
the occupancy proposed, or equal to the requirements of this chapter. It must
also provide for a development density and related bulk and coverage
characteristics in keeping with the requirements of the comprehensive plan and
reflecting that of the base zone that contains the land subject to rezoning as
a particular Planned Development.
         (a)   Establishment of Site Development Intensity.
            1.   Before approval of a Preliminary Planned Development Plan, a
detailed determination of land use intensity shall be declared.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided below, the development standards
for lots in a PD may be varied from one another and from that allowed by the
underlying base zone, provided that the density of the overall PD parcel shall
not exceed 100% of that allowed under the density provisions of the base zone.
The minimum base zone density permitted under the PD process is as follows:
 
DISTRICT ON PUBLIC SEWER    ON PRIVATE SEWER
SR       1 unit per acre    1 unit per 2 acres
R-1      2.4 units per acre 1 unit per acre
R-2      2.9 units per acre 1 unit per acre
R-3      3.5 units per acre Not permitted
         5 units per acre
R-4      (singe-family)     Not permitted
         8 units per acre
         (two-family)
R-5      14 units per acre  Not permitted
 
[In calculating the density, certain areas inappropriate for development
including but not limited to bodies of water, floodplains, and rights-of-way,
shall be discounted from the gross acreage.]
            3.   The Commission shall make a finding that said intensity is
consistent with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan of current
adoption and in the best interest of the City and surrounding areas.
            4.   If such zoning is not related to the character of development
sought by the Planned Development, then the Plan Commission shall determine
whether to require a rezoning of the site to a more appropriate zone or to
establish a development intensity pursuant to division (D)(6)(d)2. of this
section.
         (b)   Establishment of Peripheral Landscape Buffer Yard. A minimum 50-
foot peripheral landscape buffer yard shall be provided along the perimeter of
the Planned Development District. The 50-foot peripheral landscape buffer yard
shall be maintained as common area, labeled on the development plan/subdivision
plat/parcel as common area/landscaping buffer, and a minimum of 25-foot used
exclusively for landscaping and labeled. The declaration of covenants or other
recordable instrument shall state that the peripheral landscape buffer yard is
common area and maintained by the association or developer of said project.
Exception to the minimum buffer yard size requirements include those
subdivisions or parcels abutting an expressway or arterials and those
subdivisions having rear yards abutting a collector, arterial or expressway
then those specific requirements apply as set forth in the Unified Development
Ordinance. A variety of landscaping plants are required and shall adhere to §
159.185.
         (c)   Establishment of Maximum Height, Building Size. Maximum heights
and maximum/minimum building sizes shall be as required in the base zone unless
modified by the Plan Commission and approved by the Common Council as part of
the Preliminary Plan approval, unless otherwise specified in this chapter.
         (d)   Establishment of Other Site Development Regulations.
            1.   Other site development regulations, including but not limited
to parking, signs, accessory uses, landscape requirements, environmental
standards, flood plain protection, and public and private infrastructure shall
be as required in the base zone, unless otherwise specified in this chapter.
            2.   The Plan Commission may recommend, and the Common Council may
authorize, exceptions to other applicable regulations of this chapter
controlling development within the boundaries of a Planned Development,
provided that the Plan Commission shall find that such exception shall be
solely for the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial
to the tenants or occupants of such development, as well as the neighboring
property, than would be obtained under the regulations of this chapter for
buildings developed on separate zoning lots.
      (7)   Procedure. The authorization of a Planned Development shall require
approval of the preliminary development plan and detailed development plan that
conforms with the provisions laid out in this division (D)(7). Additional
information regarding the procedures and information required to file a Planned
Development ordinance, a preliminary development plan, and a detailed

159.109(D)(7).
      (12)   Changes to Village Center Development Plan. Refer to §
159.109(D)(10), Changes in the Planned Development.
   (F)   Government Use Overlay (GUO) Districts.
      (1)   Purpose. The Government Use Overlay District (GUO) is intended to
take into consideration the fact that governmental uses are different than
private uses because a governmental unit has a duty to provide services to its
citizens. Many of these entities also have the right to use eminent domain, and
many also have taxing authority and/or are tax exempt in their uses. Due to the
unique circumstances that providing services to the public presents, Government
Use Overlay Districts are used to allow the Plan Commission and the Common
Council of the City along with public input in the form of a public hearing at
the Plan Commission to consider government uses for which a single set of
written regulations may be difficult to set out. This process also allows the
consideration of uses that may not be expressly permitted within the proposed
district or require variations from the development standards that exist within
the underlying zoning district for such use. It further permits the Plan
Commission and Council to consider whether a governmental use is rationally
coordinated to promote orderly development and preservation of property values
in any particular area or instance.
      (2)   Applicability. In order to establish a government use on a property
within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Noblesville, an applicant must
(before establishing said use) first receive approval of a GUO Overlay
District. These regulations shall also apply to an expansion or amendment of an
existing Government Use Overlay that is either amending the ordinance text or
any adopted exhibits.
      (3)   Procedure for establishment of a GUO Overlay District. A GUO may be
established in any zone district within the City of Noblesville under the
following procedures:
         (a)   Submission of a development plan. An applicant shall provide a
petition to be filed with the Plan Commission with a plan indicating the
proposed location of all improvements within the zone. The plan shall include
setbacks, a landscape plan, and signage proposed within the zone. The
development plan may include for approval future proposed uses, structures, or
additions that may not be proposed for construction in the short term. The
petitioner shall also include an ordinance affecting the Government Use Overlay
District and containing a list of any deviations from the applicable standards
and any alternative proposed regulations for the proposed use.
         (b)   Review criteria.
            1.   The Director of Planning and Development or his staff shall
review the plan and shall file a report identifying any concerns regarding the
governmental use, taking into consideration the following non-exclusive list of
considerations:
               a.   The development of the use on the property should promote
orderly development that is consistent with existing development and the
preservation of property values of property within the area;
               b.   The need or benefit of the proposed government use for the
operation of the political subdivision in provision of services to the
community;
               c.   The necessity for the efficient operation of the facility
in proximity to a resource or other nearby land use;
               d.   The availability of alternative, more-suitable locations
for the proposed government use;
               e.   Possible adverse impacts of the proposed government use on
surrounding properties (considering any design elements that are, could, or
should be added to minimize any possible adverse impacts);
            2.   The Director of Planning and Development or staff may also
address to the Plan Commission any other factors that his or her staff deems
reasonable to evaluate the specific proposed government use and the public
benefit associated with the use proposed.
         (c)   Public hearing. The City Plan Commission shall hold a public
hearing on each application for approval of a Government Use Overlay District
as a map (and/or text) amendment in accordance with law. The Commission may
forward to the Common Council a favorable recommendation, an unfavorable
recommendation, or no recommendation on the plans submitted. It may also
recommend amendments to the plan or imposition of reasonable conditions upon
its approval, including the recording of covenants. Upon action by the Plan
Commission, a petition shall be certified to the Common Council in accordance
with law.
         (d)   Action by the Common Council. The Common Council shall act upon
the recommendation by considering a GUO Overlay ordinance. The Common Council
may approve with modifications, refer back to the Plan Commission, disapprove,
or provide written explanations to the petitioner on why an extension is
required by the Common Council for action. The time period for action shall be
exclusive of any time extensions or continuances requested by the petition. The
Common Council action shall be based upon the record of the Plan Commission and
shall take into consideration all of the factors set out in division (F)(2)(b)
above.
         (e)   Effect of the preliminary development plan approval. Approval of
the development plan shall not constitute approval of construction proposed
within the development plan. The approval of the Development Plan shall be
deemed as an expression of approval of the concepts and details of the
development plan. Construction may not commence until the project has received
approval under the Site Plan Review procedures detailed in §
159.041.
         (f)   Legal non-conforming uses. All government uses established prior
to adoption of this chapter, shall be considered legal non-conforming uses.
Such legal non-conforming uses are not required to have an approved Government
Use Overlay. Any expansion or renovation of the facilities after adoption of
this chapter requires the entity to complete the GUO process as laid out above
prior to submitting permits for approval of the proposed modifications.
   (G)   Wellhead Protection Overlay District.

   (H)   Federal Hill Planned Development District (FeHiPD).
      (1)   Purpose and procedures. The purpose of the Federal Hill Planned
Development (FeHiPD) district is to enhance redevelopment potential and to
integrate development with downtown Noblesville. This district is intended to
provide for a western extension of downtown Noblesville by offering standards
for building architecture, location of accessory parking and pedestrian-
oriented features as well as provisions for land uses complimentary to the
downtown, Riverview Hospital, and Forest Park. Within this district are a
number of subdistricts that represent various physical character areas.
Although the FeHiPD district shall be developed in a unified and coordinated
fashion, each of the subdistricts has a tailored purpose, use, bulk and site
development standards reflective of its location, function, and desired
appearance within the Federal Hill area. It is the intent of this district to
augment other bulk requirements of the Unified Development Ordinance. When not
specifically addressed by this district, the bulk standards of the Unified
Development Ordinance shall apply.
         (a)   Review procedures.
            1.   All development within the FeHiPD District shall be subject to
site plan review, Unified Development Ordinance subdivision regulations, and
site development standards, in addition to the use, bulk, and site development
standards of this part. All types of development proposals shall be required to
be reviewed as detailed development plans in accordance with the requirements
of the Federal Hill Planned Development district and the Unified Development
Ordinance.
               A.   All proposed subdivisions.
               B.   All development proposals in the Mixed Residential
Subdistrict (unless otherwise specified).

exceptions from the standards listed for this district and/or subdistricts.
               D.   All development proposals in the FH Flood Hazard Zoning
District.
               E.   All proposed uses listed as Special Considerations in
Appendix C-1. These uses are not assumed permitted by-right and thus, there
shall be no presumption of their approval.
            2.   Process of the detailed development plan shall always include
the review and approval of the Technical Advisory Committee. Should all the
requirements of the Federal Hill Planned Development district be met; only
additional administrative review by the Planning Department Staff is required;
however, if the requirements of said district cannot be met, then the process
requires a public hearing before the Plan Commission and Common Council seeking
relief for any waivers from the Federal Hill Planned Development district.

         (b)   Residential general regulations.
            1.   Existing residential uses in non-residential subdistricts. The
following site development standards shall apply to all subdistricts within the
FeHiPD District, with the exception of the Mixed Residential Subdistrict.
            2.   Authority to continue residential uses. Where, at the time of
adoption of an ordinance that assigns the FeHiPD Federal Hill Planned
Development District to a Noblesville Jurisdictional zoning map, lawful
residential uses of land which exist and would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by the FeHiPD, may be continued so long as they remain
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
               A.   Enlargement/improvement of existing residential structure.
Such nonconforming uses may be enlarged or increased to occupy a greater area
of land than was occupied at the effective date of rezone so long as such
improvements do not result in an increase of the value of the structure by more
than 50% of the pre-improvement value.
               B.   Moving a residential structure. No such nonconforming uses
shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other
than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of the rezone.
               C.   Termination by discontinuance or abandonment of use. If any
such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for more than one
year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
chapter for the district in which such land is located.
               D.   New construction of residential buildings. The only new
structures that shall be permitted shall be clearly accessory to the existing
residential use of the property and shall adhere to the standards for accessory
structures as outlined in §
159.121. No additional homes or separate living units shall be constructed in
the FeHiPD district unless such uses are permitted uses in the land use
subdistrict area and meets the requirements of the Federal Hill Planned
Development district.
               E.   Damage or destruction. Should such nonconforming
residential structures be destroyed or damaged by any means, then the home may
be reconstructed in a manner equal to the fair market value of the building
immediately prior to the damage.
            3.   Underlying standards. Any residential improvements inside the
FeHiPD district involving lawful non-conforming residences excluding mobile
home units located in an approved Mobile Home Park, shall adhere to the
underlying developmental standards of the R2 (Low to Moderate Density Single-
Family Residential) district.
            4.   All lawful nonconforming non-residential uses and/or
structures shall adhere to the requirements of §§
159.220 et seq. (Nonconforming Uses and Structures).
         (c)   Mixed Residential Subdistrict regulations. In the Mixed
Residential Subdistrict, the following design guidelines shall be utilized in
evaluation of the proposed planned development proposal. Design standards
within this subdistrict are required.
            1.   Guidelines for single-family attached and multiple-family
buildings.
               A.   Each development should have standards for uniform
streetlights, mailboxes, fencing, sidewalks, and similar structures.
               B.   A 30-foot buffer yard shall be maintained along the
railroad right-of-way. No structures, permanent or temporary, shall be
permitted within the 30-foot buffer yard with the exception of fences. Inside
the 30-foot landscape buffer, trees shall be planted at a minimum rate of one
tree per 40 linear feet and mounding shall be required as approved during the
Planned Development process.
               C.   Common open space and recreational facilities shall consist
of a minimum of 15% of the site. This open space area must be active in nature,
and shall not include public rights-of-way, easements, floodplain areas, or
landscape setback areas. Large open space and retention areas (generally larger
than 10,000 square feet) may only be counted if they are improved to include
active and passive amenities. Generally, wet detention facilities or impervious
surfaces shall not count toward the 15% requirement.

            1.   The purpose of the Innovation Mile District (IMD) is to create
a dynamic business and technology hub that will serve as an anchor for
revolutionary thinking and a gateway for innovation, leverage long-term growth
opportunities, and catalyze reinvestment in the City of Noblesville. This
district is intended to provide for a broad range of uses supportive of this
vision, thus expanding employment opportunities in Noblesville and enhancing
its tax base. Within this district are several subdistricts that represent
various physical character areas.
            2.   Although the IMD zoning district shall be developed in a
unified and coordinated fashion, each of the subdistricts has a tailored
purpose, use, bulk, and site development standards reflective of its location,
function, and desired appearance within the Innovation Mile area. It is the
intent of this district to augment the other bulk Articles of this Unified
Development Ordinance. When not specifically addressed by this district, the
bulk standards of the Unified Development Ordinance determined by the Director
of Planning and Development shall apply.
      (2)   Review procedures. All development within the IMD District shall be
subject to site plan review, Unified Development Ordinance subdivision
regulations, and site development standards, in addition to the use, bulk, and

supporting the denial and provide them to the applicant.
         (g)   Any appeal of a decision of the Innovation Mile Review Committee
shall be conducted by the Noblesville Plan Commission with a recommendation
sent to the Noblesville Common Council for a final decision.
      (4)   Land use and transportation components. The land use strategy and
transportation strategy for the area are intentionally integrated and an
overview of these components are as follows:
         (a)   Future Land Use Plan: Assigns the land uses within the study
area by parcel; and identifies the applicable street hierarchy applicable to
each parcel.
         (b)   Street Hierarchy: Establishes future network of streets to frame
growth; and provides a reference point for assigning more detailed
requirements.
         (d)   Land Use Character: Establishes intention and unique character
within the area; and provides requirements for land uses such as heights,
setbacks, and uses.
         (e)   Building Typologies: Establishes a range of allowable building
typologies by character district; and provides requirements for buildings such
as floorplates, facades, projections, transparency, and materials.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7990.png]
 
      (2)   Establishment of Subdistricts. The intention of this future land
use strategy is to create a new hub for innovation on the city-owned parcels
located immediately adjacent to 141st Street that will foster the growth of
Innovation Mile from Olio Road to Cyntheanne Road over time. The land use
strategy was designed to provide the city with a flexible approach to land uses
that will require specific uses in some areas and allow for market responsivity
in others. Based on the principles of form-based coding best practices, the
land use system is constructed using four fundamental components: a future land
use plan, a street hierarchy, character districts, and building typologies.
Each component provides an increasing level of detail regarding the location,
character, and detailed requirements for development within the area.
         (a)   Land Use Character Districts: The City of Noblesville hereby
creates a set of land use character districts that represent physical character
areas within the IMD District. The land use character districts are as follows:

Department. Specific uses allowed in this district will be approved by the
IMRC.
      (3)   Land Use and Street Hierarchy Plan.
         (a)   Land Use Plan: The main organizing principle behind the land use
strategy is the proposed street network. The street network, which is further
detailed in the mobility strategy section of the district, will provide a
framework for the growth for the area and character is defined based on a
parcels relationship to that network. The role of the future land use plan is
to identify each (future) parcel of development within the area and the
associated character district that will help achieve the vision for the area.
The future land use plan also identifies the street types that are associated
with each parcel that will guide more specific requirements for the character
districts and building typologies.

         (b)   Street Hierarchy Plan:
            1.   The proposed street network throughout the district uses four
street types to organize the land uses and assign more detailed requirements.
This street hierarchy is intended to inform the land use and development
related to the street and open space network by organizing the streets into an
order based on function, connectivity, capacity, and character. At the highest
level, primary streets are a major determinant for character and activity
within Innovation Mile. Primary streets are generally located on major public
spaces and shape the core brand and identity for the area, including streets
such as East 141st Street and the new signature boulevard connecting north into
future development. Efforts should be made to face building facades to the
primary streets.
            2.   Other streets seek to provide additional modes of
transportation, allow for service, and access, and increase flexibility for the
development moving forward. For example, potential alleys are provided as a
tool to allow individual decisions regarding land subdivision to increase
access, hide parking internal to the blocks, and allow for flexibility in the
overall footprint of development. Depending upon the type of street and the
types of intersecting streets, the regulations for land use and building type
requirements are adjusted to ensure that a minimum level of urban design and
architectural sensitivity is provided throughout Innovation Mile. Additional
information relating to the Street Hierarchy Plan and the types of streets may
be found in the adopted Innovation Mile Master Plan document. This includes
cross-sections for all the street types and block layout information.

      (4)   General Regulations.
         (a)   Land Use Character Districts. The City of Noblesville hereby
creates a set of land use character districts that represent physical character
areas within the IMD zoning district.

      (5)   Building type standards.
         (a)   Building types.
            1.   The City of Noblesville hereby creates a set of building
typologies. The term building typology is referred to as the categorization of
a development project according to similar building form, use, and functional
characteristics. Typically, building typologies become established within a
community over time and based on the fabric of urban development that is
established in a particular context. The building typologies identified here
share some of those similarities; however, unique building topologies have been
provided based on the aspirations of the city and the necessity to provide more
unique typologies that will build the character of Innovation Mile.
            2.   Additionally, the building typologies will provide the city
with a set of more detailed criteria for each development project that will
ensure that each new building within the area aspires to a higher-level and
quality of architectural character and design that will meet the goals of
district. These design criteria will define more nuanced details of the
buildings including typical floor plate widths, floor-to-floor heights, facade
articulation, projections, transparencies, materiality, and landscaping and
lighting. Furthermore, the building typologies will provide the developers with
a visual example of character and typical massing that will be considered
during planning review.
            3.   Building types applicable to Innovation Mile include:
               a.   Innovation / Headquarters Building (IH).
               b.   Mixed-Use Office Building (MO).
               c.   Shared Innovation / Flexible Building (IF).
               d.   Office Building (OF).

      (8)   Smart district strategies.
         (a)   Smart District initiatives are actions that Innovation Mile can
implement to attract investors and inspire all its tenants and visitors to set
the district apart as truly innovative. From a construction standpoint, it's
vital to realize decisions made today will have a lasting impact for decades to
come. By implementing Smart District strategies today, Innovation Mile will be
ready for the future impacts of extreme weather, smart technology
implementation, phase-down of fossil fuels, and other widescale and broad
paradigm shifts. Placing these innovation strategies at the forefront of
Innovation Mile design puts Noblesville at the heart of delivering a
sustainable, forward-thinking, and economically fair and prosperous society. By
catering to the needs of its workers, visitors, and operators in dynamic and
intuitive ways, a new dimension of interaction will set the Innovation Mile
apart.
         (b)   Fundamentally, this is not about creating entirely new
experiences, especially since district users would not benefit through complete
reinvention. Instead, value creation lies within the enhancement of existing
experiences through tactical implementation of spatial design and leveraging
technology. Through this lens, technology is an enabler of enhanced user
experiences rather than the focal point of the experience. The value created
through driving innovation is, in part, the result of data gathering, data-
driven insights and automation.
         (c)   These insights are valuable in that, if they are understood and
acted upon appropriately, then they will translate to improved user
satisfaction among tenants, visitors, and residents, and overall operational
cost savings.
         (d)   The following initiatives will be implemented within the IMD
over time and in coordination with the City of Noblesville on a project-by-
project basis. Proposed development projects may be required from time to time
to contribute, connect, and coordinate with some level of one or more of these
initiatives based on the location, impact, and timing of said project. Further
information on each of these initiatives can be found in the Innovation Mile
Master Plan.
            1.   Initiative #1: District Fiber Network.
            2.   Initiative #2: District Data Network.
            3.   Initiative #3: District Utility Management System.
            4.   Initiative #4: Smart Street Furniture.
            5.   Initiative #5: Digital Parking Management.
            6.   Initiative #6: Electric Vehicle Charging.
            7.   Initiative #7: Alternative Transit.
            8.   Initiative #8: Digital Signage and Kiosks.
            9.   Initiative #9: Innovation Mile Portal.
      (9)   (a)   Sustainability strategies. Districts offer unique and
expansive opportunities for sustainable development often not available to
smaller projects. At this scale, designers and stakeholders can work to
effectively share resources across the district and with the broader community;
leverage communal infrastructure to improve efficiency and resiliency; and
create opportunities for future tenants, visitors, and residents to expand
their understanding and ability to live more sustainable lives.
         (b)   Sustainability vision elements. The sustainability vision for
the Innovation Mile district has been broken down into five Vision Elements,
listed here, to help categorize potential Sustainability Strategies:
            1.   Resiliency: Create an environment and infrastructure that is
robust enough to meet operational needs under a range of future conditions.
Focus on flexible spaces, future climates, and electrical and mechanical system
resiliency.
            2.   Health and wellness: Promote healthy lifestyles and wellness
for the district's tenants and visitors. This includes both physical and mental
health in indoor and outdoor environments.
            3.   Equity and community: Prioritize equity, accessibility, and
community empowerment within the district and beyond. The district can be an
agent of change and provide key resources to the local public.
            4.   High performance design and infrastructure: Design high
performance systems to drive energy and water efficiency across the
development. This could include a district microgrid with battery storage,
distributed renewable energy, and efficient design standards for individual
buildings.
            5.   Certifications and story: Promote the sustainability vision
and story to engage and draw in tenants and visitors. Certifications are one of
the best ways to convert sustainable design to market value.
         (c)   The following initiatives will be implemented within the IMD
over time and in coordination with the City of Noblesville on a project-by-
project basis. Proposed development projects may be required from time to time
to contribute, connect, and coordinate with some level of one or more of these
initiatives based on the location, impact, and timing of said project. Further
information on each of these initiatives can be found in the Innovation Mile
Master Plan.
            1.   Initiative 1: Site Planning and Water Management.
            2.   Initiative 2: Energy Storage.
            3.   Initiative 3: Waste Management.
            4.   Initiative 4: Solar Energy.
            5.   Initiative 5: Low Carbon Mobility.
            6.   Initiative 6: High Performance Building Design Standards.
            7.   Initiative 7: Community Scale Certification System.
      (10)   Existing residential uses.
         (a)   Existing residential uses. The following site development
standards shall apply to all single family residential uses already existing
within the IMD zoning district.
            1.   Authority to continue. Where, at the time of adoption of an
ordinance that assigns the IMD (Innovation Mile) to a Noblesville
Jurisdictional zoning map, lawful residential uses of land which exist and
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by the IMD, may be continued
so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
            2.   Enlargement/improvement of existing residential structure.
Such nonconforming uses may be enlarged or increased to occupy a greater area
of land than was occupied at the effective date of rezone so long as such
improvements do not result in an increase of the value of the structure by more
than 50% of the pre-improvement value.
            3.   Moving a residential structure. No such nonconforming uses
shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other
than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of the rezone.
            4.   Termination by discontinuance or abandonment of use. If any
such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for more than one
year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
division (K) for the district in which such land is located.
            5.   New construction of residential buildings. The only new
structures that shall be permitted shall be clearly accessory to the existing
residential use of the property and shall adhere to the standards for accessory
structures as outlined in §§
159.120  through
159.132  - General Regulations of the Unified Development Ordinance. No
additional homes or separate living units shall be constructed in the CCPD
unless such uses are permitted uses in the land use area and then shall adhere
to the "RI Low Density Single Family Residential" zoning district.
            6.   Damage or destruction. Should such nonconforming residential
structures be destroyed or damaged by any means, then the home may be
reconstructed in a manner equal to the fair market value of the building
immediately prior to the damage.
            7.   Underlying standards. Any residential improvements inside the
IMD district shall adhere to the underlying developmental standards of the R1
(Single-Family Residential) district.
            8.   Conflict with §§
159.220  through
159.229  of Unified Development Ordinance. In the case where the specific
provisions of this division are in conflict with §§
159.220  through
159.229  (Nonconforming Uses And Structures) of the Unified Development
Ordinance, the standards of this division shall apply.

well as the applicable requirements of the zoning district in which they are
located except where otherwise noted in this part.
      (2)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for sensible and
reasonable land use standards to allow for the provision of adequate, reliable
public and private telecommunication service. There is a need to maximize the
use of service facilities in order to reduce the total number of towers needed
to service the needs of the areas, as well as a need to minimize the adverse,
undesirable visual effects of service facilities while still providing for
reasonable location of such towers within the city’s zoning jurisdiction.
      (3)   Location of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
         (a)   Wireless Telecommunication Facilities shall be a permitted use
in the following zoning districts:
            1.   I-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District;

            4.   The following subdistricts of the CCPD (Corporate Campus)
Zoning District:
               a.   Industrial/Office;
               b.   Regional Recreation and Entertainment; and
               c.   Agricultural/I-O.
         (b)   Wireless Telecommunication Facilities shall be a conditional use
in the following zoning districts:
            1.   PB (Planned Business) Zoning District.
            2.   In any residential zoning district in which the structures may
be setback at least 500 feet from an adjoining residential development or
property.
            3.   In any district where the antennas are to be located upon pre-
existing structures or buildings so long as the petitioner proposes to
sufficiently screen or camouflage antennas and antenna support structures.
            4.   In any district upon property owned or operated by units of
government or public utilities.
            5.   In any district, in a non-urban area, a term associated with
I.C. 36-7-4-1103. “Urban area” is defined in the Code as follows: all lands and
lots within the corporate boundaries of a municipality, any other lands or lots
used for residential purposes where there are at least eight residences within
any quarter mile square area, and other lands or lots that have been or are
planned for residential areas contiguous to the municipality.
         (c)   Wireless Telecommunication Facilities shall be a special
consideration in the following subdistricts of the CCPD (Corporate Campus)
zoning district:
            1.   Office;
            2.   Office/Flex Uses;
            3.   Commercial;
            4.   Commercial/Office; and
            5.   Community.
   (B)   Procedural Standards. All Wireless Telecommunication Service
Facilities shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   The placement of antennas upon existing antenna support structures
or any electrical work at existing support structures may be administratively
approved by the Planning Director. The applicant shall submit all appropriate
permits and drawings deemed necessary by the Director of Planning.
      (2)   In the event an antenna support structure ceases to be used, the
antenna support structure shall be removed within 180 days of termination of
use. Cellular on Wheels (COW) must be removed from the parcel within three days
after the event to which it is servicing.
      (3)   In the zoning districts in which a Wireless Telecommunication
Facility is listed as either a permitted or conditional use, a Wireless
Telecommunications Facility may be deemed an accessory use.
      (4)   The following documentation shall be submitted for all applications
for a Wireless Telecommunications Facility. This information shall be submitted
in addition to the standard application requirements for the type of
application being filed. The Planning Director may waive any of the submission
requirements based upon a written request of the applicant that must be
submitted at the time of application. The waiver of any submission requirement
may only be granted if the Planning Director finds in writing that, due to
special circumstances of the application, the information is not required to
determine compliance with the standards of this chapter.
         (a)   A location map showing all Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities within a two mile radius of the proposed facility. The applicant
shall indicate which existing facilities in the area they already have existing
antenna arrays located on. Applicant shall also indicate on this map the size
and location of the search ring identified by their engineering studies to find
a site to fill the network coverage gap.
         (b)   Evidence demonstrating that no existing building, site, or
structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed facility, the evidence for
which may consist of any one or more of the following:
            1.   Evidence that no existing facilities are located within the
targeted market coverage area identified by the applicant’s engineering
requirements.
            2.   Evidence that existing facilities do not have sufficient
height or cannot be increased in height at a reasonable cost or within the
limitations of this chapter at a reasonable cost to meet the applicant’s
engineering requirements.
            3.   Evidence that existing facilities do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant’s proposed antenna array and
related equipment. Specifically:
               a.   Planned, necessary equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing facility, considering the existing and planned use of
those facilities, and these existing facilities cannot be reinforced to
accommodate the new equipment at a reasonable expense.
               b.   The applicant’s proposed antenna or equipment would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers, or the
antenna or equipment with the existing facility would cause interference with
the applicant’s proposed antenna.
               c.   Existing or approved facilities do not have space on which
planned equipment can be placed so it can function effectively.
            4.   The fee, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share or adapt an existing facility are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding the pro rata share of new facility development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
            5.   Evidence that the applicant has made diligent good faith
efforts to negotiate co-location on an existing facility, building, or
structure and has been denied access.
         (c)   A propagation map, before and after, of how the proposed
facility fits in the applicant’s telecommunications network. The after
propagation map shall demonstrate that the proposed facility will fill a
significant coverage gap.
         (d)   A scenic assessment for the project area consisting of the
following:
            1.   Elevation drawings of the proposed facility, showing height
above ground level and details on the antenna array attachment or arrangement.
            2.   A site plan indicating the proposed placement of the facility
on the site, including the delineation of the proposed lease area; location of
existing structures, trees, means of access to the lease area, and the type of
material being used, and other significant site features.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 159.140 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The regulations of this section are designed to alleviate or prevent
congestion of streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-site storage,
loading, and/or unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use by which
a property is occupied. Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities
shall be provided and maintained for all buildings, structures, or premises
used for purposes permitted by this chapter in accordance with the provisions
of this subchapter, except for uses in the Core Central Business District
(CCBD) which shall be exempt from the applicable parking ratio requirements as
outlined in Ordinance 45-11-92 and any amendments thereto.
   (B)   These regulations also recognize that stormwater runoff from
impervious areas, including off-street parking and loading areas, can result in
increased flooding and property damage, degradation of streams, less
groundwater recharge, impaired water quality, increased water temperatures in
streams, loss of habitat, and decreased recreational opportunities. The impact
of stormwater runoff from off-street parking and loading areas shall be
addressed as part of this subchapter.
   (C)   It is a further purpose of this subchapter to ensure that parking is
not excessive for the associated use, and that the design and construction of
parking areas minimizes their impact on the city's water resources by utilizing
"Low Impact Development (LID)" to manage stormwater and reduce the urban heat
island effect.

§ 159.141 SCOPE AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   Nonconforming Parking.
      (1)   No use previously lawfully established shall be required to provide
and maintain the parking and loading requirements herein, provided, however,
that off-street parking and loading spaces required by any previous ordinances
adopted pursuant to the Indiana Planning Statutes shall be deemed conforming.
(See §§
159.220 et seq., Nonconforming Uses and Structures.)
      (2)   For any nonconforming use which is hereafter damaged or partially
destroyed, and which is lawfully reconstructed, re-established, or repaired,
off-street parking and loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the
time of such damage or partial destruction shall be restored and continued in
operation, provided, however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this
ordinance for equivalent new uses.
   (B)   Additional Parking Required.
      (1)   For Additions. When the intensity of use of any building,
structure, or premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling
units, floor area, beds, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement,
parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such
increase in intensity of use.
      (2)   For Change in Use. Whenever the existing use of a building,
structure, or premises shall hereafter be changed or converted to a new use
permitted by this chapter, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use.
      (3)   Accessory Parking Permitted. Nothing in this chapter shall be
deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, and operation of
such facilities are adhered to.
      (4)   On-Street Parking. On-street parking shall be permitted, but the
Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) or the City of Noblesville may
place restrictions on this use.
      (5)   Use of Accessory Parking by Other Uses is Limited. Accessory off-
street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the
total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate
requirements for each such use, and no parking space or portion thereof shall
serve as a required space for more than one use, unless otherwise authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals as Shared or Mixed-Use Parking, pursuant to §
159.146.
      (6)   Distinction Between Parking and Loading Areas. Required off-street
loading and unloading spaces shall not be construed as being part of the
required off-street parking spaces.
      (7)   Limitations on Parking Areas.
         (a)   Use of Parking Areas Limited. Accessory off-street parking
facilities shall be utilized solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or
light trucks of less than one ton capacity, of patrons, occupants, or employees
of specified uses. Said parking facilities shall not be used for the storage,
display, sale, repair, dismantling, or wrecking of any vehicle, equipment, or
material.
   Further, no repair work, sales, or service of any kind shall be permitted in
association with accessory off-street parking facilities, unless such
facilities are enclosed in a building and such work or service is otherwise
permitted in the district. No inoperable vehicles shall be stored in an off-
street parking area for more than 24 hours.
         (b)   Drive-Through Stacking. A property owner proposing a drive-
through facility shall provide a minimum of four stacking spaces for each
drive-through station in addition to the parking required by this section. Each
lane of stacking space must be at least nine feet wide and must be delineated
with pavement markings. Each stacking space shall be 25-feet long; however,
individual spaces within the lane shall not be delineated with pavement
markings. Stacking lanes may not be located within required driveway, internal
circulation, or parking aisle widths.

§ 159.142 REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Computing Number of Required Spaces. In determining the minimum
required number of off-street parking or loading spaces, the following
instructions shall be applicable in such computations:
      (1)   Determining Floor Area. Off-street parking requirements shall be
calculated based on gross square footage of the use to which the parking is
accessory, or as otherwise provided in Table 8.
      (2)   Fractions. If the calculation of required parking spaces results in
a fraction, said fraction shall be considered as being the next unit and shall
be counted as requiring one space.
      (3)   Public Assembly Seating. In sports arenas, churches, and other
places of assembly in which patrons occupy benches, pews, or other similar
seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat
for the purpose of determining requirements thereunder.
      (4)   Calculating Required Parking For Bar and Restaurant Combinations.
For bars and nightclubs which serve food and for restaurants which include a
bar, required parking shall be calculated according to Table 8. Since bars and
restaurants require different parking, this table allows parking to be
calculated accurately based on how much of the use is a bar and how much is a
restaurant. This table is based on the premise that a restaurant requires
greater kitchen space than a bar.

To use the table determine the gross square footage of the kitchen area and
divide that number by the gross square footage of the building in which it is
located. The resulting number may be converted to a percentage. Reference that
percentage in the first column of the table, and follow the row across. If, for
example, the percentage of the kitchen area is 25%, then 50% of the public
floor area in the building is calculated as a bar and 50% as a restaurant.
Reference Table 9 to determine the required parking ratio for each use.
      (5)   Determining Parking Requirements for Unlisted Uses. For uses not
specified in Table 9, the number of parking spaces shall be determined by the
Director of Planning and Development, on the basis of requirements for similar
uses, the gross square footage of the use, and the relationship between the
size of the use and the number of persons served or employed.
      (6)   Additional Parking Spaces above the Required Number as per the
following Tables. Additional parking above the required number shall be
increased by a maximum of 10% and be constructed using pervious concrete,
permeable pavers, or other similar materials. Plans shall also incorporate an
additional 2% of interior parking lot landscaping above the required percentage
per Table 12.0.5.C.1. entitled 'Interior Parking Lot Landscape Requirement'.
Low Impact Development (LID) landscaping standards and techniques shall be
implemented.

§ 159.143 DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS FOR PARKING LOTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All off-street parking areas shall be developed in
accordance with the standards of this section, except in the case of one-
family, two-family, and agricultural uses, and storage of vehicular merchandise
not counting toward the minimum requirements as set forth in this chapter.
However, driveways for one-family, two-family and agricultural uses shall be
limited to a width of 20 feet or 30 feet as provided in this section and one
per street frontage.
   (B)   Dimensions and Layout. Each off-street parking space shall open
directly upon an aisle or driveway at least 12 feet wide or such additional
width and design in accordance with Table 10, below, so as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. Such aisle or
driveway shall be unobstructed and allow for the passage of emergency vehicles
at all time.

      NOTES:   No two-way aisle shall be less than 24' in width.
            All measurements are in feet.
   (C)   Location and Access of Off-street Parking and Loading Areas.
      (1)   Right-of-Way Access.
         (a)   All off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed
with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner
which will least interfere with traffic movement.
         (b)   Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided along
arterials and major collectors where necessary, as determined through site plan
review. Such accel/decel lanes shall parallel and adjoin the improved part of
the right-of-way and shall measure at least 11 feet in width. Accel/decel lanes
shall be at least 100 feet in length, exclusive of the entrance way and taper
area. However, if the lot frontage is too small to meet such requirement, the
acce1/decel lane shall extend the entire width of the lot.
         (c)   Each use that fronts upon an arterial shall provide an easement
for the purpose of a frontage lane to reduce the number of curbs cuts and
traffic conflicts along said arterial. The applicant shall bear the cost of
constructing the frontage road across his or her own property and such frontage
road shall be constructed prior to the granting of a certificate of occupancy
for the use, except as otherwise provided in §
159.045(C).
      (2)   Driveways.
         (a)   Non-residential driveway entrances or exits shall be at least 25
feet from an adjoining residential property line; ten feet from an adjoining
non-residential property line; or 45 feet from an intersection.
         (b)   Owners of adjoining properties shall provide combined driveways
wherever practical. In conjunction with approval of a development, the City may
require a property owner to provide an access and circulation easement to an
abutting owner where joint access is reasonable to serve future development.
Such entrances or exits shall be designed in such a manner as to interfere
least with traffic movement.
         (c)   No single non-residential or multi-family driveway shall exceed
a width of 30 feet at the right-of-way line. However, a driveway 36 feet in
width at the right-of-way line shall be permitted provided pavement markings
indicate three separate lanes, one for ingress and two for egress. An entrance/
exit divider not to exceed ten feet in width shall not be counted towards the
width limit. Non- residential driveways are limited to one per street frontage
and shall be approved by the Engineer having jurisdiction thereof.
         (d)   Driveways for single-family or two-family residential uses shall
be subject to the minimum and maximum widths at the property line shown in
Table 10(C)(2)(d) below. Such residential driveways shall be setback at least
seven and a half feet from the property line. Residential driveways located on
property fronting more than one public street, shall have the leading edge of
the driveway at least 25 feet from the intersection, or in a location approved
by the Engineer having jurisdiction thereof. Upon installation of the driveway,
there shall be installed a "No Parking Here to Corner" sign between the
driveway and the intersection.

      (3)   Location of Accessory Parking and Loading on Same Lot. Accessory
off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided on the same lot as the
use served, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and may be situated
as one or more individual areas.
      (4)   Location of Parking and Loading Behind Required Setback. Accessory
off-street parking and loading areas shall not be located in any required yard,
except as specified otherwise by this chapter. When permitted within required
yards, a landscape buffer shall be provided along the property-line of the yard
in which it is located, pursuant to §
159.185.
      (5)   Design Requires Interior Circulation. Required off-street parking
spaces shall be so designed, arranged, and regulated as to have individual
spaces marked, be unobstructed and have access to an aisle or driveway so that
any automobile may be moved without moving another, and so that no maneuvering
directly incidental to entering or leaving a parking space shall be on any
public right-of-way or walkway.
   (D)   Improvement Standards for Parking Lots.
      (1)   Paving Required. Parking and driveway areas shall be paved with
asphalt or constructed of concrete or permeable pavement and be curbed with
rigid or roll-type curb as per the Noblesville Standards. As an alternative to
continuous curb, wheel stops or strategic breaks in the barrier curb shall be
provided in order to allow for drainage into LID Stormwater BMP's.
      (2)   Drainage of Runoff. Such parking areas shall be graded and properly
drained in such a manner that there will be no free flow of water onto either
adjacent property or public sidewalks. Any runoff generated by such improved
areas shall be disposed of in appropriate drainage facilities as per the
Noblesville Standards and the Stormwater Technical Standards.
      (3)   Marking of Parking. Such parking areas shall be so lined or
designated as to ensure the most efficient use of the parking spaces and
provided with bumper guards or wheel guards so located that no part of the
parked vehicle will extend beyond the boundary of the established parking area
into any minimum required yard on onto adjoining property.
      (4)   Parking Lot Lighting. A minimum of one foot-candle of illumination
shall be provided throughout the parking lot. Illumination of off-street
parking areas shall utilize fully-shielded lighting fixtures so as not to
reflect direct rays of light onto adjacent properties or streets, and prevent
excessive uplighting, pursuant to §§
159.200 through
159.208.
   (E)   Landscaping. All off-street parking areas shall be landscaped pursuant
to §
159.184.
   (F)   Special Regulations for Parking Garages and Attendant Buildings.
      (1)   Buildings Used for Parking Garages. Parking Garages, whether
Principal or Accessory uses, shall be treated as any structure and shall be
subject to all requirements thereof.
      (2)   Attendant Buildings. Parking areas may be provided with one one-
story shelter or guard building which shall not exceed 100 square feet of gross
floor area and which shall conform to all the standards of the district in
which it is located.

§ 159.146 PARKING AS A PRINCIPAL USE.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby authorized to grant conditional use
permits for Parking as a Principal Use in accordance with the following
conditions:
   (A)   Development Plan Required. A development plan for Parking as a
Principal Use shall be filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals as a required
exhibit accompanying the Conditional Use application and shall be made part of
the conditions of any approval therefor. The development plan shall demonstrate
compliance with all applicable standards of this chapter and shall indicate:
      (1)   Adjacent streets, alleys, and lots;
      (2)   All individual primary uses to be served, including the location,
use, and number of parking spaces required for each such use;
      (3)   A layout drawn to scale of aisles and driveways, entrances, exits
and turn-off lanes, parking spaces, setbacks, drainage facilities, and
landscaping and buffer screening;
      (4)   Type of lighting, pavement, and signs proposed including location,
size, and design thereof.
   (B)   Setbacks and Access. Parking as a Principal Use shall be provided with
the setback requirements of the zoning district in which they are located, and
ingress and egress points shall be limited to protect the function of adjoining
streets.
   (C)   Parking as a Principal Use Requires Legal Encumbrance. Parking as a
Principal Use shall be encumbered by any instrument duly executed and
acknowledged, which links such parking facilities to the use(s) served. Said
instrument shall specify and bind the time period to the anticipated life of
the building or use which the parking facilities serve. Said instrument shall
be filed in the applicable Improvement Location Permit files of the Department
of Planning and Development, and placed on public record in the office of the
Hamilton County Recorder.
   (D)   Design of Principal Use Parking Areas. Principal Use parking
facilities shall be developed in accordance with all of the provisions of this
subchapter. Further, said facilities shall be developed under such conditions
imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals as to protect residential districts and
maintain at a minimum the disturbance to nearby residential uses.
   (E)   Changes to Development Plans for Parking as a Principal Use.
Development Plans for Parking as a Primary Use shall be amended by the
applicant to indicate any change or other modification of uses served, or
number of parking spaces provided therefor. Such amended plans shall require

§ 159.147 PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES TO REDUCE PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following programs and incentives are provided to permit reduced parking
requirements in the locations and situations outlined herein where the basic
parking requirements of this chapter would be excessive or detrimental to goals
and policies of the city relating to traffic congestion and environmental
protection.
   (A)   Credit For On-Street Parking. Wherever on-street parallel parking is
provided in the improvement of a street, credit toward off- street parking
requirements shall be granted at the rate of one off-street space per every 25
feet of frontage. However, parallel parking shall not be permitted in the
following areas:
      (1)   Frontage on an expressway or arterial street.
      (2)   Frontage on a street that is less than 32 feet wide curb-to-curb or
closest edge of the traveled lane.
      (3)   Frontage within 20 feet of a corner.
      (4)   Frontage within ten feet of each side of a driveway or alley.
      (5)   Frontage within a fire hydrant zone or other emergency access zone.
   (B)   Shared Parking.
      (1)   Purpose and Applicability. Generally, a group of non-residential
uses may provide a joint parking area if the number of spaces in the area at
least equals the aggregate of the spaces required for the several uses subject
to the requirements for location of parking and off-site parking in this
subject. However, uses that require parking areas at times when nearby uses do
not need their parking facilities may, by agreement approved by the Director,
use those facilities instead of providing their own.
      (2)   Requirements. The Director may approve shared parking facilities
located on adjoining separate properties or on a single site according to the
following requirements:
         (a)   Facilities located on adjoining separate properties must be
within 600 feet of each other.
         (b)   A convenient pedestrian connection shall be provided between the
properties.
         (c)   The availability of parking for all affected properties or uses
is indicated by directional signs.
         (d)   The number of spaces proposed meets the following restriction:
            1.   Where the uses to be served by shared parking have overlapping
hours of operation, the property owner or owners shall provide spaces equal to
the total of the individual parking requirements for the uses served, reduced
by 10% of that total number. The director may approve a further reduction of
that number if the property owner(s) demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Director that the resulting provision of parking will be adequate for the
proposed uses.
            2.   Where the uses to be served by shared parking do not overlap
their hours of operation, the property owner or owners may provide parking
stalls equal to the greater of the applicable individual parking requirements.
      (3)   Written Agreement Required. Prior to establishing shared use of
parking, the property owner or owners shall file with the Department of
Planning and Development a written agreement approved by the Director of
Planning and Development providing for the shared parking use. The agreement
shall also be recorded on the title records of each affected property.
   (C)   Mixed-Use Parking.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   Mixed-use Parking Program is presented as an option to reduce
the total required parking in large mixed-use facilities in which the uses
operate at different times from one another throughout the day. The city
recognizes that strict application of the required parking ratios may result in
the provision of excessive numbers of parking spaces and, therefore, excessive
pavement and impermeable surfaces. A Mixed-use Parking Program allows the
property developer to use parking spaces more efficiently by allowing the same
spaces to be "shared" by various land uses.
      (2)   Applicability. The Mixed-use Shared Parking Program may be applied
for wherever mixed uses are proposed.
      (3)   Procedure.
         (a)   The Director of Planning and Development may authorize a
reduction in the total number of required parking spaces for two or more uses
jointly providing on-site parking if the respective hours of operation of the
uses do not overlap, as demonstrated by the application of Table 12.
         (b)   If one or more of the land uses proposing to use joint parking
facilities do not conform to one of the general land use classifications in
Table 12, the applicant shall submit sufficient data to indicate that there is
not substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the uses. Such
data may include information from a professional publication such as those
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or the Urban Land
Institute (ULI), or by a professionally prepared parking study.
         (c)   For changes of use in mixed-use projects the applicant must
demonstrate that parking necessary for the new mix of uses does not exceed the
amount which was required by the previous mix of uses.
         (d)   The total number of parking spaces required per Table 9 shall
not be reduced by more than 20%.

How to Use the Schedule of Mixed Use Parking:
Calculate the number of spaces required for each use if it were free-standing
(refer to the Schedule of Minimum On-site Parking Requirements). Applying the
applicable general land use category to each proposed use, use the percentages
to calculate the number of spaces required for each time period (six time
periods per use). Add the number of spaces required for all applicable land
uses to obtain a total parking requirement for each time period. Select the
time period with the highest total parking requirement and use that total as
your mixed use parking requirement.

SIGNS
§ 159.160 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to create the legal framework for a
comprehensive and balanced system of signs, to promote and facilitate a simple
and pleasant communication between people and their environment; protect the
public health, safety, and general welfare; minimize hazards to pedestrians and
motorists along thoroughfares, intersections: and public rights-of-way; enhance
the aesthetic environment of the City of Noblesville’s jurisdictional limits;
and avoid visual clutter that may be harmful to property values, business
opportunities and community appearance. It is a further goal to protect the
residential character of neighborhoods by limiting the intrusion of non-
residential signage into residential neighborhoods, and setting out strict
standards to allow for limited intrusion of signs where appropriate. It is the
intent of this subchapter to authorize the use of identification signs that
are:
   (A)   Compatible with their surroundings;
   (B)   Appropriate to the activity that displays them;
   (C)   Expressive of the identity of individual and the community as a whole;
   (D)   Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen;
   (E)   Simple and concise;
   (F)   Cognizant of the need for adequate business identification while
promoting an attractive appearance throughout the community through the use of
sensible quality control, adequate maintenance and inspection, and by
reasonable guidelines formulated to minimize clutter;
   (G)   Allow residents to conduct activities like garage sales that are
considered customary and incidental to normal use of a residential home but
temporary and limited in duration and scope of event;
   (H)   Allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive, and incidental
to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject
to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for
permits;
   (I)   Provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances without regard to

§ 159.165 OTHER SIGN PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Areas of Special Control.
      (1)   This subchapter and the Table of Permitted Permanent Signs cannot
adequately regulate all desirable types and designs of signs in an area as
diverse as Noblesville. The city may therefore, pursuant to §
159.044, designate certain real estate as “Areas of Special Control” including
architectural, historic, or scenic areas.
      (2)   The City of Noblesville shall maintain and shall revise as required
a zoning map of Noblesville indicating the boundaries of all designated “Areas
of Special Control.”
      (3)   The City of Noblesville shall adopt special regulations for signs
in “Areas of Special Control” which shall be consistent with the character of
the specific area.
      (4)   To the extent in conflict, special regulations for "Areas of
Special Control" supersede and may be either more or less restrictive than the
regulations for signs contained in this subchapter.
   (B)   Program of Signs.
      (1)   One or more adjacent activities not located in an “Area of Special
Control” may submit a Program of Signs to the Plan Commission. The Program of
Signs shall contain a visual representation of the lettering, illumination,
color, area, height, placement, and location of the signs proposed for display.
The items of information displayed on the signs proposed by an activity in the
Program of Signs shall not exceed the items of information allowance.
      (2)   The Plan Commission may approve a Program of Signs if the signs
visually represented in the Program are consistent with the purposes of this
subchapter, are appropriate to the function and architectural character of the
building(s) in which the activity is located, and are compatible with the
existing adjacent activities.
      (3)   An activity whose Program of Signs has been approved by the Plan
Commission may display only those signs that comply with the approved program.
   (C)   Substitute Provisions.
      (1)   Subject to the property owner's consent, any non-commercial copy
may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any commercial copy on any sign
permitted by this code. If non-commercial copy is substituted, the sign will
continue to be treated as the original commercial sign under this code and will
not be deemed or treated as an off-premise sign. The content of any non-
commercial copy on any sign otherwise permitted by this subchapter may be
changed without complying with any provisions of this subchapter normally
required for sign copy or design approval.
      (2)   The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent
favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any
particular non-commercial copy over any other non-commercial copy.
         (a)   This provision does not create a right to increase the amount of
permanent signage on a parcel, lot, or land use.
         (b)   This provision does not affect the requirement that a sign
structure or mounting device be properly permitted.
         (c)   This provision does not allow a change in the physical structure
of a sign or its mounting device.
         (d)   This provision does not allow the substitution of off- premises
commercial copy in place of on-premises commercial copy or non-commercial copy.

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
§ 159.180 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of these regulations is to ensure environmentally
sensitive site planning which further is intended to foster aesthetically
pleasing developments by enhancing the biodiversity, reducing the atmospheric
carbon, improving water quality, filtering the air and reducing toxic chemicals
in the environment and increasing the compatibility of adjacent land uses so as
to minimize the harmful impacts of noise, dust, headlight glare, artificial
light intrusions, and other objectionable activities. These regulations are
intended to promote the prudent use of water, energy resources, and
sustainability through habitat preservation areas, wetlands, stream bank
buffers, wooded areas, waterfront yards, and existing native vegetation and
trees.
   (B)   Broader objectives include:
      (1)   Prohibit clear-cutting of property.
      (2)   Protect and increase the value of residential and non- residential
properties within the city.
      (3)   Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new
residential and nonresidential land uses to the city.
      (4)   Protect healthy quality trees and promote the natural, ecological,
environmental, and aesthetic qualities of the city.
      (5)   Emphasize the importance of trees and vegetation as both physical
and visual barriers.
      (6)   Maintain the moisture levels in the area of lands with natural tree
cover.
      (7)   Prevent soil erosion.
      (8)   Minimize the cost of construction and maintenance of drainage
systems necessitated by the increased flow and diversion of surface waters by
facilitating natural drainage systems and amelioration of storm water drainage
problems.
      (9)   Provide shade.
      (10)   Conserve natural resources.
      (11)   Enhance the habitat and food source for birds and other wildlife,
which in turn controls the insect populations and maintains the balance of
natural ecosystems.

revocation of the certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   Low Impact Development (LID) Stormwater BMP's may be incorporated into
required landscaping (i.e. Bioretention, Rain Gardens, Bioswales, etc.)
provided the site conditions make LID feasible and that the intent of the
required landscaping is not compromised.
   (E)   Landscaping plans shall include provisions for the following types of
landscaping, as applicable:
      (1)   Parking Lot Landscaping.
         (a)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
         (b)   Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (2)   Building Base Landscaping.
      (3)   Landscape Buffer Yard.
      (4)   Screening.
   (F)   All landscape plans shall contain the following information, unless
specifically waived by the Director of Planning and Development.
      (1)   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and
rights-of-way, sidewalks, curbs, bicycle paths, ground signs, trash receptacle
enclosures and recycling areas, bicycle parking areas, fences, freestanding
electrical equipment, recreational facilities, power lines (identify type of
line such as transmission), transformers, irrigation systems, and other
freestanding structural features including structural Stormwater BMP's as
determined necessary by the Director of Planning and Development.
      (2)   On the adjacent properties within 20-feet of the site, include the
location of existing buildings, structures and plant materials, unless waived
by the Director of Planning and Development. Include location, type, quantity,
size, and name of plant materials.
      (3)   The location, type, quantity, size and name (both botanical and
common), of all existing plant materials. The notation of all trees with a
diameter of six inches or greater at a point four feet above grade, as well as
details of the estimated canopy size, health, and whether the tree is to be
retained or removed.
      (4)   The location, type, quantity, size and name (both botanical and
common), of all proposed plant materials including but not limited to trees,
shrubs, groundcover, annuals/perennials, and turf. The canopy spread shall be
denoted on the plans for all trees.
      (5)   Existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at
two foot intervals. Proposed berming shall be indicated using one foot contour
intervals.
      (6)   Elevations of all fences and retaining walls proposed for location
on the site.
      (7)   Elevations, cross-sections, and other details as determined
necessary by the Director of Planning and Development.
      (8)   Summary data indicating the area of the site in the following
conditions:
         (a)   Total area and percentage of the site in landscaped area.
         (b)   Total area and percentage of the site in domestic turf grasses.
   (G)   Where the required landscape area exceeds 1,000 square feet in
aggregate, the landscape plan shall be prepared by a licensed landscape
architect. A landscape contractor may prepare the landscape plan for either a
ground sign application or a designation size application only.
   (H)   Landscaping shall not be located within drainage and/or utility
easements. However, when landscaping is used as a Stormwater Best Management
Practice (BMP), the BMP must be in an exclusive "BMP Easement" to prevent
damage from other utility work or encroachments and/or from the space becoming
reallocated for other purposes and to ensure perpetuity of the BMP. These BMPs
are regulated under the Rule 13 Stormwater Program and required to be
inventoried and inspected for compliance of maintenance and proper function.
Drainage easements will usually adjoin a major LID practice to allow for
overflow/high flow events and/or a 100-year flood event.
   (I)   The Director of Planning or his/her designee may allow required plant
materials to be moved to alternate locations both on- and off-site, but only if
there are site features or constraints that prevent installation of such
materials in the required locations or it is determined that there is no
appreciable improvement to the site by installing the landscape materials in
the required locations. This may include the substitution of a particular type
of plant material to another type of plant material. (Example: one ornamental
grass as a substitute for one deciduous shrub). It should not include a shrub
for a tree.
   (J)   Best Management Practice (BMP) can refer to structural measures
(wetlands, ponds, sand filters, etc.) or non-structural measures (restrictive
zoning, reduced impervious area, etc.). BMPs are designed for the benefit of
water quality and quantity. All new construction under the Stormwater Rule 13
must provide Post- Construction BMPs. The BMPs that meet the required pollutant
removal rate and are regulated under the Stormwater Rule 13 require MS4 review
and approval, special easements, maintenance agreements, physical maintenance
and inspections to ensure proper performance in perpetuity. Post-Construction
BMPs are required to be inventoried and subject to inspections and maintenance.

§ 159.183 DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.
   Landscape plans described above shall be prepared and reviewed based on the
following design standards and guidelines. Design standards are objectively
measurable design requirements that can be definitively evaluated for
compliance. Design guidelines are not precisely measurable but compliance can
be determined through the evaluation process of site plan review.
   (A)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   Plant Materials. Plant materials used in conformance with the
provisions of this section shall be of good quality, disease and pest free at
planting, and of a species normally grown in Central Indiana, and capable of
withstanding the extremes of individual site microclimates. Plant material
shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture, color, and for its
ultimate growth. A variety of compatible species should be included in the
planting plan for a specific site or development. The use of drought-tolerant
plant material is preferred. The use of salt-tolerant plant material is
preferred for landscaping in or near the rights-of-way.
         (a)   The primary landscaping materials used in and around private
parking areas shall be trees that provide shade at maturity. Shrubs,
groundcover, and other planting materials may be used to compliment tree
landscaping, as described above but shall not be the sole contribution to the
landscaping.
         (b)   The primary landscaping materials used in the landscape buffer
yards and adjacent to the buildings shall be shade trees, ornamental trees,
shrubs, and groundcovers and other planting materials.
         (c)   The primary landscaping materials used in LID Stormwater BMP's
shall be trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation that are able to tolerate and
thrive at various depths and lengths of inundation. Refer to Appendix H-
3 "Stormwater Technical Standards Manual".
      (2)   Softening of Walls and Fences. Plant materials should be placed
intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other
barriers to create a softening effect.
      (3)   Clearance. Trees shall be planted so that when they reach maturity,
there will be a minimum of ten feet of clearance between the tree trunks and
structures, buildings, overhangs, walls, fences, and/or other trees.
      (4)   Scale and Nature of Landscaping Material. The scale and nature of
landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the size of the structures. Large
scaled buildings, for example, should generally be complemented by larger
scaled plants. Form, texture, color, pattern of growth, and adaptability to
local conditions shall be considered when selecting plant materials.
      (5)   Evergreens. Evergreens should be incorporated into the landscape
treatment of a site, particularly in those areas where screening and buffering
are required.
      (6)   Planting Beds. Planting beds should be mulched but mulch shall not
be used as a substitute for plant materials.
      (7)   Preservation of Existing Plant Materials. Existing plant material
should be incorporated into the landscaping treatment of a site. The
preservation of natural features and landscaping is a criterion for subdivision
and planned development review. (See §
159.191 for additional requirements).
      (8)   Protection of Plant Materials.
         (a)   The interior dimensions, specifications, and design of any
planting area or planting median proposed to be constructed shall be sufficient
to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to provide for proper
growth.
         (b)   Clearance of trees and vegetation during the land development
process shall be limited to that necessary for and directly related to the
construction of improvements specifically authorized by the improvement
location permit.
         (c)   In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by
pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards or other devices.
         (d)   Landscaping installed adjacent to parking areas shall require
that all plant materials are set back from the edge of the pavement/concrete a
sufficient distance so that parked vehicles do not overhang the landscape area
and destroy or damage the plant materials.
      (9)   Designing for Safety. Landscaping shall not be approved which would
inhibit or make more difficult the use of emergency vehicles, and all approved
landscaping plans will give consideration to safety precautions which will
protect both vehicular and the pedestrian public. Landscaping modifications
will also be considered for public buildings, including schools, to allow for
greater visibility and allow for natural surveillance around the building
structure. Plantings in landscaping areas shall not obstruct line-of-sight or
vision corner clearance areas. To maintain site lines trees shall be planted a
minimum of 20 feet from the curb of intersecting streets, five feet from a
driveway, and ten feet from a street light or street regulatory or warning
signs. Adequate provisions for snow storage shall be considered by the Director
of Planning and Development or his or her designee.
      (10)   Detention/Retention Basins and Ponds. Detention/ retention basins
and ponds shall be landscaped. Such landscaping should include shade and
ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubs, hedges, turf, groundcover, and other
plant materials. To enhance the stormwater quality benefits of detention/
retention basins and ponds, native plants shall be used to filter and trap
harmful sediments and pollutants before they reach the basin or pond. Refer to
Appendix H-3 "Stormwater Technical Standards Manual".
      (11)   LID Stormwater BMP's. LID Stormwater BMP's shall be landscaped.
Areas included in rain gardens or vegetated sites including features created to
meet Stormwater Management Requirements Ordinance No. 24-5-06 and any
amendments thereto shall be counted toward any interior site or parking lot
landscaping, and if vegetated to meet the requirements for landscaped buffers
shall count towards those buffer requirements.
      (12)   Domestic Turf Grasses. Domestic turf grasses should be used in
areas with little or no slope to prevent the runoff or irrigation water.
      (13)   Energy Conservation. Plant material placement will be designed to
reduce the energy consumption needs of the development.
         (a)   Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of
buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
         (b)   Evergreen and other plant materials should be concentrated on
the north side of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
      (14)   Height of Landscaping.
         (a)   Where proposed landscaping or screening is to abut a public road
or parking area, the measured height of materials used shall be based on the
grade of the abutting road or parking area and the top of the material used.
         (b)   Where a proposed landscape or screening area is to abut an
adjoining neighbor’s property line, the measured height of materials used shall
be based on the grade of the abutting property line and the top the material
used.
      (15)   Noise Reduction. Properties adjacent to highly traveled roads,
and/or commercial or industrial uses shall arrange landscaping to reduce the
intensity of noise by reflecting, deflecting, or absorbing sound. Earth berms,
walls, fences and/or plantings providing physical separation are examples of
techniques to reduce or absorb noise.
   (B)   Design Standards.
      (1)   Selection. Permitted plant materials are outlined in Table 12.0.4.E

clusters as opposed to being evenly spaced in a line. In the case where
clustering is used, no tree shall be located any closer than ten feet, or any
further than 50 feet from the next closest required tree. Any such clustering
plan must be approved by the Director of Planning and Development prior to
installation of the landscaping.
      (3)   Staggering Requirement for Trees and Shrubs. When required for
perimeter parking landscaping and buffering, trees and shrubs may be required
to be planted in staggered rows to provide the effective diagonal planting of
the plants.
         (a)   Tree Staggering. These rows should be planted in a manner to
provide for equal spacing both in width and depth between each plant.

         (b)   Shrub Staggering. Shrubs should be planted in an alternating
pattern formed by two rows, two feet apart on center, each of which is made up
of shrubs six feet on center.

      (4)   Undulating Planting Beds. Where applicable, it is desirable to
create undulating planting beds to provide more landscape interest, as opposed
to trees and shrubs being evenly spaced in a straight line.
      (5)   Mixing Plant Species. When more than 20 shrubs and ten trees are
required on a site to meet these regulations, a mix of species shall be
provided. The following table indicates the maximum quantity of trees and
shrubs of the same species and genus that may be planted. In addition, shrubs
should generally be divided equally between deciduous and evergreen varieties.

> 100     > 400      4                          30%
 
      (6)   Berms. Berms shall maintain a maximum height of six feet and a
minimum height of three feet. The berm shall be required to maintain a 3 to 1
slope. The top of such berms shall be located as closely as possible to the
property line of the use. The landscaping required in this case shall be equal
in number to the landscaping number otherwise required for buffering of the
use. In terms of height, the landscaping plus the berm shall be required to
meet the height standard that would otherwise be required for the buffering of
the use.
      (7)   Fences or Walls. Decorative fences or walls shall be permitted, in
addition to required landscaping, between a nonresidential development and
adjacent residential structures or along the frontage of residential
subdivisions. This standard does not apply to individual single-family or two-
family residences. Fences or walls shall comply with the following:
         (a)   Fences and walls shall be solid, opaque, and constructed of wood
or masonry.
         (b)   No fence shall be located inside of any required front yard
setback unless granted a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals or a waiver
from the Plan Commission and/or Council.
         (c)   In order to break the visual monotony of a masonry or wood fence
or wall, at least one shrub or vine shall be planted abutting the wall for
every ten feet of wall length, but not necessarily evenly spaced ten feet
apart.
         (d)   The required shrubs/vines shall be installed outside of the
fence/wall, and the fence/wall shall be erected a minimum of four feet inside
the property line to allow for the planting and maintenance of the shrubs/
vines.
         (e)   In lieu of the vine or shrubbery requirements above, the
Director of Planning and Development shall be authorized to approve a masonry
wall having significant design variation evenly spaced at internals of not more
than 20 feet.
      (8)   Duplicate Planting Requirements. It is not the intent of this
chapter to generate multiple rows of trees and shrubs resulting from
implementation of this chapter together with street tree requirements and/or
other landscaping treatments. In these instances, the most restrictive standard
shall be used. In some instances, where the building or parking lot setback
from the right-of-way is greater than 20 feet, street trees may still be
required in addition to other landscaping requirements, per the discretion of
the Director of Planning and Development.
      (9)   Application Variations.
         (a)   Central Core Map (
Appendix G). Due to the more compact layout of the Central Core Map, normal
landscaping requirements may be impractical, therefore modified parking lot and
landscaping buffer requirements are outlined in the associated tables in §§
159.184 and
159.185.
         (b)   Corporate Campus Planned Development District (CCPD). See §
159.107 for landscaping requirements.
         (c)   Federal Hill Planned Development District (FeHiPD). See §
159.109 for landscaping requirements.
         (d)   Village Center Planned Development District (VCPD). See §
159.109 for landscaping requirements.
         (e)   All Other Areas. Landscaping standards as set forth within this
chapter, apply to all areas within the Noblesville Planning Jurisdiction
outside of the Central Core Map, Corporate Campus Planned Development District,
Federal Hill Planned Development District, and the Village Center Planned
Development District as described above.
      (10)   Installation Prior to Certificate of Occupancy. All landscaping
required by the approved landscaping plan shall be installed prior to issuance
of the final certificate of occupancy unless approved by the Director of
Planning and Development for weather related reasons or unique circumstances.
Where landscaping cannot be installed, a surety bond must be posted with the
city covering 110% of the estimated installation costs including the plant
materials.

§ 159.184 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Intent. Parking lot landscaping required by this section is intended
to promote attractive, safe, off-street parking lots by providing minimum
requirements for installation and maintenance of landscaped areas. This section
places a high priority on the safe flow of pedestrians and vehicles within a
parking lot. It also requires adequate safe emergency lanes for fire trucks and
other emergency vehicles.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   Required parking lot landscaping shall consist of two types: 1)
Interior Parking Lot Landscaping, and 2) Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping as
described below. The standards required for these two types of landscaping
shall be determined by the "class" of parking lot proposed on the site. The
parking lot "class" shall be determined by the total number of proposed parking
spaces for a given use.
         (a)   Class A      0 to 20 spaces
         (b)   Class B      21 to 50 spaces
         (c)   Class C      51 to 200 spaces
         (d)   Class D      >200 spaces
      (2)   Where parking lots and/or parking lot landscaping were legally
existing as of the effective date of this chapter, but do not conform to the
provisions of this chapter, such parking lots shall be considered legally non-
conforming. Upon any expansion to such non-conforming parking lots and/or
parking lot landscaping, or the expansion or alternation of a structure
associated with that parking lot and/or parking lot landscaping, the entire
parking lot existing and expanded shall be subject to the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (C)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)   Planting Islands. In some cases where parking is required for a
use, a certain percentage of the paved area must be maintained as landscape
areas which include landscape islands and peninsulas. To function as an "LID
Stormwater BMP", the landscape island or peninsula shall be at a lower grade
than the surrounding pavement and curbing shall allow drainage from pavement to
enter into recessed landscape areas. For the purposes of calculating this
requirement the following table shall be employed.
 
   Table 12.0.5.C.1.
   INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS
        Percent of Required Landscaping in Maximum Parking Lot Island Size
        Parking Lot                        (Square Feet)
Class A 1%                                 180
Class B 5%                                 750
Class C 8%                                 1,000
Class D 11%                                No Maximum
 
         (a)   All single row parking landscape islands and peninsulas shall be
a minimum of 180 square feet in area with a minimum width of nine feet measured
from back of curb to back of curb or edge of pavement. Each island and
peninsula shall contain a minimum of one canopy tree and five evergreen or
deciduous shrubs, or ornamental grasses. If the landscape island is intended to
function as an "LID Stormwater BMP", then the plant material should be able to
tolerate and thrive at various depths and lengths of inundation. Refer to
Appendix H-3 "Stormwater Technical Standards Manual."
         (b)   All double row parking landscape islands shall be a minimum of
240 square feet in area with a minimum width of nine feet measured from back of
curb to back of curb or edge of pavement. Each island and peninsula shall
contain a minimum of two canopy trees and ten evergreen or deciduous shrubs, or
ornamental grasses.
         (c)   All interior parking rows shall be terminated at both ends with
landscape islands. The exterior parking rows abutting the perimeter parking lot
landscaping area, which are not adjacent to a structure, shall require the
installation of one additional canopy tree at both ends of the exterior row.
All parking islands shall be dispersed so as to define aisles and limit
unbroken rows of parking to a maximum of 100 feet in length. For calculating
purposes, handicapped parking spaces shall count as one parking space. (See
illustrations below.)

         (d)   One hundred percent of every parking lot island or peninsula
outside of shrub masses shall be planted in turf or other approved groundcover
in the appropriate density to achieve complete cover within two years as
determined by the approved landscape plan.
         (e)   If the specific application of the interior landscape
requirements will seriously limit functions of the building site, the Director
of Planning and Development shall have the authority to permit consolidation
and relocation of these landscaped areas on the building site.
         (f)   The primary plant materials used in parking lots shall be canopy
tree species, in conformance with applicable provisions of §
159.183(A) and (B) above. Understory trees, shrubbery, hedges, and other plant
materials may be used to supplement the canopy tree plantings, but shall not be
the sole contribution to such landscaping.
   (D)   Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)   Intent and Application. The landscape requirements identified below
provide for the enhancement of all parking lots by recognizing two distinct
conditions. The first condition is where parking lots are located within front
and corner side yards, where a uniform scheme of landscaping is required to
protect the aesthetics along public streets. The second condition is where
parking lots are located within rear and interior side yards and minimum
requirements for beautification of both residential and nonresidential uses are
desired. The intent is to require a higher level of landscaping abutting or
adjacent to residential uses (principally multi-family uses) than for non-
residential uses. It should be noted that the issue of reducing impacts between
dissimilar uses is addressed in §
159.186.
      (2)   Area and Configuration.

1.   For calculation purposes, plant quantities are rounded up to the nearest
whole number when the calculation is .5 or greater.
2.   Refer to tree and shrub staggering diagrams.
3.   Setbacks are the minimum required unless specified elsewhere in this
chapter.
         (a)   These requirements may be altered by the Director of Planning
and Development, Plan Commission, or the Board of Zoning Appeals to protect
vehicular or pedestrian traffic or to facilitate free movement of emergency
vehicles.
         (b)   All trees shall be planted within ten feet of the parking lot
edge.
         (c)   All shrubs shall be planted within five feet of the parking lot
edge.
      (3)   Shared Parking Facilities. All paved areas that encroach upon the
required ten foot perimeter parking lot landscape areas, except those abutting
a public right-of-way shall conform to the following.
         (a)   The total area that is removed must be provided as interior
parking lot landscaping on those parcels. This area shall not be counted
towards the overall required interior parking lot landscaping as stated above.
         (b)   Plantings in these areas shall comply with the standards stated
in this section.
   (E)   Parking Garages. All parking garages shall be required to meet the
following landscape and urban design requirements:
      (1)   Perimeter Landscaping. Parking structures shall provide along any
street frontage pedestrian-related amenities such as sitting areas, planters,
and visually interesting wall surfaces at the street level. There shall be such
amenities provided so that 20% of the building facade will contain such spaces.
Such amenities shall be evaluated through Site Plan Review. In all cases, there
shall be a minimum sidewalk width along the street of eight feet that shall not
be impeded by such pedestrian-related amenities.
      (2)   Interior Landscaping. Interior landscaping requirements for parking
garages may be met by providing hanging baskets, landscape planters, and/or
flower boxes around the exterior of the first three levels of the parking
garage structure.

§ 159.185 BUILDING BASE LANDSCAPING.
   The entire base of each commercial/industrial/institutional and multi-family
building shall be surrounded by a landscape strip as prescribed in the table
below. Such landscaping shall not be counted toward the overall required
plantings for the interior parking lot. These landscape strips may be broken by
pedestrian access ways; however, these access ways may not constitute more than
10% of the total area of the required landscape strip. No more than 40% of the
required building base landscape area shall be located on any one side of the
building. Shrubs and ornamental trees along foundation walls of structures
shall be planted no closer than two feet and eight feet, respectively. In
certain circumstances additional standards shall be required as follows:

landscaping requirements are waived. If the front yard setback utilized is less
than the building base landscaping requirement, the building base landscaping
requirement may be reduced by the difference of the two.
2.   For calculation purposes, plant quantities are rounded up to the nearest
whole number when the calculation is .5 or greater.
   (A)   Loading Areas. Where a drive-thru or loading area is permitted or
required for a use, and where it is necessary to locate this drive-thru or
loading area inside of the building base landscaping, the affected landscape
areas may be moved. In these cases, an area of landscaping equal to the amount
removed must be added to other areas of the building's base landscaping.

§ 159.186 LANDSCAPE BUFFER YARDS.
   (A)   Applicability. The regulations of this section shall establish the
dimensions and improvement requirements of landscape buffer yards as required
for transitions between uses and along the city's corridors.
   (B)   Changes in Landscape Buffer Yards for Planned Developments. Landscape
buffer yards may be established, increased, or decreased by the Plan Commission
and Common Council as part of the zoning approval of any planned development.
   (C)   General Restrictions. Landscape buffers around an entire land use
shall be reserved for the planting of material and installation of other
buffering materials as required within this section. No parking, sidewalks,
stormwater detention facilities, regulated drains, fences, walls, accessory
buildings, structures, easements or other impervious surfaces shall be
permitted to be located inside any required landscape buffer yard. Allowable
encroachments include landscaping and earthen berms. Consideration may be given
to driveways and sidewalks needed to service a use or building and can be
administratively approved by the Director of Planning and Development, or
decorative walls/fences approved by the Plan Commission and Council for a
planned development. All landscape buffer yards shall include a variety of
landscape plants per development. Buffering requirements, when applicable,
shall be used to supplement all other required landscaping and shall not be
used in lieu of other required landscaping, unless otherwise stated in this
subchapter.
   (D)   Maintenance of Landscape Buffer Yards. Landscape buffer yards are
designated as Common Area/Landscape Buffer Yard and shall be maintained by the
homeowner's association and/or developer as per the declaration of covenants
for the subdivision and/or planned development. Other acceptable recordable
documentation for the maintenance of the landscape buffer yards may be approved
by the Director of Planning and Development on a case-by-case basis.
   (E)   Size and Improvement of Landscape Buffer Yards. The size and
improvement of the landscape buffer yards for various situations shall be as
per the table below.

(Ord. 10-03-13, passed 4-9-13)
§ 159.192 NATURAL AREA PROTECTION.
   The purpose and intent of this section establishes regulations for the
preservation of natural areas to prevent the unnecessary cutting, removal, or
killing of trees, and/or native vegetation; to provide protection for these
critical areas including woodlands or high tree concentrations; critical
habitats that contain rare, threatened or endangered species; wooded 100-year
floodplains; wooded wetlands; wooded slopes; wooded or partially wooded stream
corridors with drainage areas greater than 50 acres; and riparian areas. The
intent is to promote the health, attractiveness, and safety of the community;
to foster aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sensitive development that
protects and preserves the appearance and character of the city, and encourages
preservation of natural areas such as mature tree stands and stream corridors.
These regulations promote important physical and psychological benefits through
the use of preservation and protection of the natural areas reducing noise and
light pollution; promoting innovative and cost conscious approaches to design,
installation, and maintenance of said areas, and establishes procedures for the
administration and enforcement. These regulations apply to both new site
development and any redevelopment of a site.
   (A)   Natural Area Tree Preservation Plans.
      (1)   Tree preservation plans shall be submitted prior to any site
development including redevelopment of a site, grading, excavating,
construction of a new building or structure, new site development and/or any
other use or permit as deemed appropriate by the Director of Planning or his or
her designee.
      (2)   Evaluation of the tract’s natural areas shall be undertaken by an
arborist, landscape architect, or horticulturalist.
      (3)   All trees which possess a diameter requirement of a minimum of six
inches shall be inventoried and included on the tree preservation plan.
      (4)   Tree preservation plans shall detail locations, sizes, and common
name of preserved trees, individual shrubs, areas of dense tree or shrub
concentrations, and other natural features that are to be preserved or removed.
      (5)   Existing trees that are preserved shall be credited toward required
landscaping requirements based on the sizes and locations of such preserved
trees.
      (6)   Fencing, barriers, or other materials shall be specified on the
tree preservation plan. All tree preservation plans shall be approved by the
Director of Planning and Development or his/her designee.
   (B)   Tree Preservation.
      (1)   Trees must have a life expectancy of greater than ten years.
      (2)   Trees/vegetation shall be in good condition.
      (3)   Trees shall have a relative sound and solid trunk with no extensive
decay.
      (4)   Trees shall have no more than one major dead limb or several minor
dead limbs.
      (5)   Trees shall have no major insect or pathological problems.
   (C)   Tree Preservation Efforts.
      (1)   The practicality of arranging the site plan components around
existing natural areas shall adhere to the following:
         (a)   Plans for groups of structures should be designed to preserve
areas of high tree concentrations, desirable individual tree specimens, and
desirable stands of trees and shrubs.
         (b)   The condition of the vegetation with respect to its continued
vitality.
         (c)   The possibility of preserving vegetation through pruning rather
than removal.
         (d)   The desirability of a particular tree or species by reason of
its appearance, historic or ecological significance, botanical characteristics,
and the function that the vegetation would fulfill as a site plan component.
         (e)   The practicality and economic possibility of designing the
location and grades of proposed structures and paving to preserve existing
vegetation.
         (f)   The potential for interference with utility services along the
use of the roads and walkways.
   (D)   Credits for Saving Mature Trees. Where it is possible to save older
and/or larger trees, each tree determined to qualify and designated on the
landscape plan subsequently shall be saved and credited toward other required
tree plantings. The location of the trees to be saved shall be used to
determine the areas where landscaping requirements can be redirected. The
diameter of the trees that qualify under this section, and the respective
credits that they merit, are listed in the table below:
 
   Table 12.0.12.D.
   TREE PRESERVATION CREDITS
Diameter of Tree                            Credit
(measured at a point four feet above grade)
Less than 2.5 inches                        No Credit
2.6 inches to 5.9 inches                    1 to 1
6 to 17.9 inches                            2 to 1
18 inches or greater                        3 to 1
 
   (E)   Protection Practices.
      (1)   Protecting the root zone is the most critical factor in tree
preservation throughout the development process. Disturbances within this area
directly affect tree survival. To protect the root zones, the following
standards apply:
         (a)   When earthwork, grading, or construction activities are planned
adjacent to a natural area, a limit of disturbance line shall be shown on the
construction plans and tree preservation plans. All such areas shall be
protected through installation of temporary fencing, barriers, or other
measures approved by the Director of Planning. Such fencing, barriers, or other
materials shall be installed and identified through signage as a “TREE
PRESERVATION ZONE” (multiple signs) prior to commencing land disturbance, and
shall remain throughout the period of construction.
         (b)   Barriers shall be used to protect trees during site development.
The root zone of trees shall include no less than the total area beneath the
tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy of the tree(s) plus a five-
foot wide protective buffer.
         (c)   Disturbed areas adjacent to tree preservation zones shall be
mulched to provide additional protection to tree roots.
         (d)   Grading measures or protective devices, such as tree wells, tree
walls, or specialized fill and pavement designs, shall be installed when
necessary to preserve identified tree specimens.
         (e)   Grade changes adjacent to tree preservation zones shall not
result in alteration to soil or drainage conditions that would adversely affect
existing vegetation. These areas shall be evaluated for flood tolerance and
stormwater routed around these areas deemed intolerant of an increase of
additional flow from urbanization.
         (f)   Construction site activities such as parking, material storage,
burry pits, concrete washout, etc., shall not be allowed within the tree
preservation zone.
         (g)   The determination of sight-distance clearances along roadways
shall be completed graphically and submitted to the Department of Planning and
Development for review and approval.
         (h)   No disturbance shall be permitted within the tree preservation
zone including trenching, backfilling, driving or parking equipment, and/or
dumping of trash, oil, paint, or other materials detrimental to plant health.
No vehicles, machinery, tools, chemicals, construction materials, or temporary
soil deposits shall be permitted within such barriers. No notices or other
objects shall be nailed or stapled to preserved trees.
         (i)   Mature trees shall not be topped. The trees shall be pruned
according to procedures established by the American National Standards
Institute A300 Pruning Standards.
         (j)   Should any tree designated for preservation die within five
years of project completion, the owner/developer/ association shall replace
such tree with a tree of equal tree preservation value within 180 days based on
the following calculations:
 
Table 12.0.12.E.j.

NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 159.220 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and Scope. Within the districts established by this chapter or
by amendments that may later be adopted, there exist the following:
      (1)   Non-conforming lots;
      (2)   Non-conforming uses of land;
      (3)   Non-conforming structures;
      (4)   Non-conforming uses of land and structures in combination; and
      (5)   Non-conforming characteristics of use; which were lawful before
this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments hereto. It
is the intent of this chapter to permit these non-conforming uses to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the
intent of this chapter that non-conforming uses shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses which are prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (B)   Illegal Uses. Illegal uses existing at the time this ordinance is
enacted shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.
   (C)   Burden of Owner to Establish Legality of Non-conformity. The burden of
establishing the legality of a non-conformity that is lawfully existing under
the provisions of this chapter is upon the property owner of the non-conformity
and not upon the City.
(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96)
§ 159.221 GENERAL STANDARDS OF APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Avoidance of Undue Hardship. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed
to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any
building or development on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently. Where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun prior to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be construction,
provided that the work shall be carried on diligently.
   (B)   Uses Under Conditional Use Provisions are Not Non-conforming Uses. Any
use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of
this chapter shall be deemed a conforming use in such district without further
action.
   (C)   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. On any non-conforming structure or
portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use, work may be done in any
period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent
not exceeding 10% of the current replacement cost of the non-conforming
structure and market value of real estate, or non-conforming portion of the
structure, whichever the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing
when it became non-conforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section
shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition
of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged
with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. If a non-
conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use
becomes physically unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall
not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96)
§ 159.222 NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Single Non-conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record after the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter notwithstanding
limitation imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located.
Note: This section shall apply only to single-family residences.
   (B)   Lots in Combination. If two or more lots or a combination of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the
lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this chapter; and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel
be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in
this chapter.
(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96)
§ 159.223 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   (A)   Authority to Continue. Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter,
lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed by this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they remain
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (B)   Enlargement of Structure. No such non-conforming uses shall be
enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (C)   Moving. No such non-conforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part
to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (D)   Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment. If any such non-
conforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for more than one year
(except when government action impedes access to the premises), any subsequent
use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for
the district in which such land is located.
   (E)   New Construction. No additional or accessory structure not conforming
to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such
non-conforming use of land.
(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96) Penalty, see §
159.999
§ 159.224 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Authority to Continue. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not now be
built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot,
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful.
   (B)   Structural Alteration or Enlargement. No such non-conforming structure
may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity, but any
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (C)   Extension of Use. A non-conforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (D)   Moving. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Damage or Destruction. Should such non-conforming structure or non-
conforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more
than 50% of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the
damage, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.
(Ord. 62-12-95, passed 1-22-96) Penalty, see §
159.999
§ 159.225 NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful uses may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, except as otherwise provided below.
   (A)   Structural Alteration or Enlargement. No existing structure devoted to
a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located
shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the
district in which it is located.
   (B)   Substitution of Non-conforming Use. If no structural alterations are
made, any non-conforming use of a structure or structure and land, may, upon
appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another non-conforming use
provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall find that the proposed use is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Change in Use. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in
or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (D)   Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment. When a non-conforming
use of a structure, or structure and land combination, is discontinued or
abandoned for more than one year (except when government action impedes access
to the premises), the structure or structure and land in combination shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.

159.999
§ 159.226 NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE.
   (A)   Authority to Continue. If a characteristic of development or use
lawfully exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter
that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter,
the lawful characteristic of development or use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, except as otherwise provided below. Such
characteristics of development or use shall include, but not be limited to,
items such as landscaping, lighting, parking lots, refuse containers, driveway
surfacing, and screening.
   (B)   Alterations to the Site Requiring Compliance. Any additions to the
building or the site that increase the area by more than 40% will require that
any nonconforming characteristics of development or use shall comply with the
standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 10-03-13, passed 4-9-13)
§ 159.227 NON-CONFORMING USES IN THE FLOOD HAZARD (FH) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Non-conforming Status for Flood Hazard (FH) District. Any building,
structure, or other use in the Flood Hazard (FH) District which is not in
conformance with this chapter constitutes a non- conforming use.
   (B)   Structural Alteration or Enlargement in a Floodway. In a floodway, no
non-conforming use may be expanded or enlarged nor can a building undergo
substantial modification without a permit for construction in floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Structural Modification in a Floodway Fringe or Flood Plain. In a
floodway fringe or flood plain, a building which constitutes a non-conforming
use may undergo substantial modification provided such modification is on a
one-time-only basis and further provided that such modification does not
increase the value of the building by more than 40% of its pre-improvement
market value (excluding the value of land), unless such building is permanently
changed to a conforming use.

the Rl Bulk Standards as listed in Table 5, Summary of Residential Bulk
Requirements (see §

1.0   Overview
   Pervious or porous concrete pavements permit the percolation of water
through voids in the pavement structure to the sub-grade which may reduce storm
water runoff and pollutants carried during its transportation and dispersion.
   In an attempt to provide a cost effective alternative to conventional storm
water detention methods while reducing the impact caused by additional
development, the City of Noblesville has developed minimum standard
requirements for pervious concrete pavement. The premise of these standards is
to:
   1.   Establish minimum performance criteria for the pavement structure, in a
manner consistent with other pavements that are currently permitted by City
Standards
   2.   Establish reasonable compliance with the City's Stormwater Ordinance,
while observing traditional engineering practice, the City of Noblesville's
Ordinances; and,
   3.   To utilize design and quality control measures recommended by the
concrete industry for pervious concrete
   The following requirements and standards shall be considered as a supplement
to the City of Noblesville Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, which are
incorporated by reference herein. These standards shall also reference and
incorporate the subject matter in the City of Noblesville's Unified Development
Code that involve projects which propose to utilize this design standard.
   These standards shall be observed, applied, and demonstrated to obtain final
approval for an Improvement Location Permit and the use of pervious concrete
pavement. The purpose of using pervious concrete pavements shall not be to
circumvent the requirement of detention or the need to save design costs. The
concrete industry recognizes that pervious pavements are sensitive to in-situ
conditions and require unique design consideration and expertise in their use.
These standards were developed from several resources and incorporate their
findings and recommendations. The placement of pervious concrete pavement and
its use in a manner similar to conventional paving materials is not acceptable
as it does not perform in a similar manner.
2.0   Design
   Design and approval of any pavements utilizing pervious concrete shall
follow the requirements of these standards and be subject to the City of
Noblesville's Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, the City of Noblesville's
Construction Standards, and the Unified Development Code, latest editions.
   Pervious concrete is NOT a traditional pavement structure and may not be
readily and simply substituted for regularly used hot-mixed asphalt (HMA) or
customary INDOT standard concrete mixture without addressing the City of
Noblesville's stormwater detention requirements.
   The structure of pervious concrete pavement is designed to function as both
an outlet for stormwater runoff and a surface to transport and store vehicular
traffic.
   The design standards outlined for pervious concrete pavements outlined
herein were developed using information, theory, methodology, and guidelines
established and published by the Portland Cement Association, the National
Concrete Pavement Technology Center, the National Ready-Mixed Concrete
Association, the North Carolina State University's Department of Biological and
Agricultural Engineering, and Iowa State University's Center for Transportation
Research and Education.
3.0   Subgrade
   The subgrade for proposed pervious concrete pavement serves two purposes. It
must be pervious to permit the percolation of water into the earth so it may
dissipate an acceptable release rate without adversely affecting surrounding
off-site areas, while addressing the City's design criteria for the storage of
runoff. The subgrade must also be stable enough to adequately support the load
from the pavement and applied traffic.
   Percolation tests shall be procured by the developer through the designer to
determine the suitability of the soil to percolate runoff from the pavement
course. The number of tests for the site shall be determined by its overall
size, with tests at two evenly-spaced location sites of 10,000 sf or less.
Sites exceeding 10,000 sf in size shall submit a percolation plan and report
for subsurface soils according to the following table:
 
Site Area (SF)           Number of Percolation Test Locations
10,000                   2
10,000 to 15,000         3
Every 5,000 sf Increment 1 per 5,000 sf of
Exceeding 15,000 SF      additional area
 
   A sampling plan shall be provided to the City of Noblesville for approval
prior to the completion of the test. In general, test locations shall be evenly
spaced and near the middle half or third of the proposed pavement area. The
City of Noblesville reserves the opportunity to request any modifications or
additions to any proposed sampling plan based on the conditions, shape, size
and use of the lot. This is not to infer that sampling plans will be expanded,
it is conceivable that fewer test spots could be needed, depending on the case
and situation.
   Using the results of the percolation test, the designer shall determine the
average Infiltration Rate in inches per hour (in/hr) for the site. Calculations
and the results of the field investigation for the determination of the average
infiltration rate shall be submitted with the proposed site plan for review.
[1]
4.0   Mix Design
   For each project, a mix design shall be submitted for approval with the
project plans and specifications. The following section provides material
specifications and requirements for the pervious concrete mix. The seven day
compressive strength of pervious concrete pavement mixtures shall range from
3,300 to 2,900 psi.
   4.1   Cementitious Materials
   Portland cements meeting the criteria of ASTM C 150 and C 1157 may be used
as well as blended cements meeting the standards of ASTM C 595 and C 1157. Fly
ash and pozzolans meeting the requirements of ASTM C 618 may also be used in
the proposed mix. Due to problems with odors and discoloration of any runoff
which may occur offsite, blast slag may not be used. Mix proportions for
cementitious materials in the proposed mix shall be from 550 to 700 lbs/yd3.
   4.2   Aggregate
      4.2.1   Aggregate
      Aggregate for the pervious concrete batch mix shall be 2000 to 2500 lbs/
yd3. The aggregate to cement ratio shall be 4 to 4.5:1. The proportions of
course and fine aggregates are presented in the following sections.
      4.2.2   Coarse Aggregate
      The content of coarse aggregate in the batch mixture shall be narrowly
graded and consist of aggregate meeting the requirements of course aggregate
conforming to ASTM C 33 No. 67 or No. 8.
      4.2.3   Fine Aggregate
      The content of fine aggregate to coarse aggregate ratio in the pervious
concrete batch mixture shall be limited to range of 0 to 1:1 by mass.
   4.3   Water Cement Ratio
   The water to cement (w/c) ratio for the project mix shall be 0.27 to 0.30.
Water used in the manufacture of the batch shall comply with Section 913.01 of
the Indiana Department of Transportation's Standard Specifications, latest
edition.
   4.4   Admixtures
   The use and purpose for admixtures, such as retarding agents, shall be
clearly indicated in the mix design submitted for the project. All admixtures
shall conform to ASTM C 494.
5.0   Pavement Design
   5.1   Aggregate Base
   Aggregate base for pavement shall be evaluated by the designer for each
individual site to determine whether the minimum required standard depth of
aggregate base is suitable for the traffic loads proposed for the site. The
standard minimum aggregate base for all pervious concrete pavements shall be 8
inches of INDOT Gradation No. 2 Course Aggregate. The volume of void space for
the proposed aggregate base compacted in place should be obtained from the
supplier for use in determining the storage capacity of pavement base. The void
ratio by volume for the aggregate base layer shall be 35% ± 5%.
   5.2   Pavement
   The minimum thickness of pervious concrete pavement used for commercial or
institutional use shall be 8 inches. Locations subject to higher amounts of
truck traffic shall be evaluated using traditional rigid pavement design
techniques and increasing the depth of the rigid pavement by a factor of 1.25.
The void ratio in the mixture shall be determined and range between 15% and 20%
by volume.
6.0   Drainage and Detention Design
   The completion of runoff and storage computations for analyzing the water
storage available in pervious [2] pavements is a "5 part process". The
methodology for the selection of the site's hydrologic design criteria and
storage and runoff computations shall be documented in the design calculations
for the project and submitted for review with the site plan for TAC Review. The
process to determine storage and runoff is as follows.
   6.1   Section of Design Storm
   The selection of the parameters for the design storm and the pre-developed
runoff condition for all sites shall be determined in accordance with the City
of Noblesville's Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
   The runoff coefficient used to determine the runoff from pervious concrete
pavement for the required design storm shall be 0.95.
   6.2   Determine the Water Storage Capacity of the Pavement
   The storage capacity of the pervious concrete and aggregate base courses of
the pavement shall be determined using the individual void ratios for each
section.
   The volume of voids in the pavement structure shall be computed as follows:
      vT=(Aa x da x va) + (Ap x dp x vp)
      Where:
      vT   =   Total Volume of Voids for Pavement Structure
      Aa   =   Total Area of Aggregate Base
      da   =   Depth of Aggregate Base
      va   =   Percent of Voids by Volume in Compacted Aggregate Base
      Ap   =   Total Area of Pervious Concrete Pavement
      dp   =   Depth/Thickness of Pervious Concrete Pavement Course
      vp   =   Percent of Voids by Volume in Pervious Concrete Pavement
   6.3   Determination of Storage Volume and Release Rate
   The analysis and design of pervious concrete pavements shall follow the
methodology of the Hydraulic Design of Permeable Pavements, July 14, 2000,
North Carolina State University's Department of Biological and Agricultural
Engineering College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. This publication provides
a logical step-by-step method for determining the storage capability for
pervious concrete pavements.
   An additional acceptable method of analysis and design can be obtained from
the Portland Cement Association, the National Concrete Pavement Technology
Center, and the National Ready-Mixed Concrete Association. These groups have
combined to create an interactive CD that contains an Excel-based design and
analysis program.
   No site plan utilizing pervious pavement shall be approved through The City
of Noblesville's Technical Advisory Committee Review without drainage
computations in a format compatible with or similar to the two aforementioned
procedures certified by a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of
Indiana.
7.0   Site Design
   All other applicable City design standards and ordinances shall be observed
during the design of parking lots utilizing pervious concrete.
   In areas where the proposed pavement is on grade or is adjacent to a
concrete approach that exits onto City right-of-way, the designer and
constructor shall use and install an impervious membrane, such as visquene, to
separate the aggregate base courses to prevent subsurface drainage from flowing
to areas other than the subgrade directly under the area of pervious concrete.
This type of separation is discussed in the publications referenced in these
standards.
   Curbs shall be provided as per the Unified Development Ordinance. The
presence of curbs provides lateral support for the pavement structure and to
control parking drainage and traffic patterns.
   All pervious pavements shall be constructed with a six inch diameter
underdrain that has a positive outlet to an existing public drainage facility.
The underdrain for the proposed pavement shall be designed in a manner
consistent with the City of Noblesville's typical details for street
underdrains.
   Pervious concrete pavements shall be designed to store a maximum depth of
six inches of ponded water on-site in the event of failure or frozen
conditions. The depressed area may be designed to permit the discharge of water
off-site when six inches of runoff is stored in the parking area. This
provision shall be observed to provide the owner to maintain or rehabilitate
pervious pavement detention systems that fail or do not operate as intended.
   The City of Noblesville may develop standard drawings to supplement or
clarify the criteria outlined in these written standards.
8.0   Construction
   Pervious pavements shall be constructed in compliance with the plans and
specifications for the project. These standards have been approved and adopted
by the City of Noblesville's Board of Public Works and Safety and shall hereby
incorporated into the City of Noblesville's Stormwater Standards Technical
Manual. Authority is hereby given to the City of Noblesville's Wastewater
Utility to develop and promulgate standards to address and mitigate stormwater
quality issues associated with the installation, construction, and maintenance
of pervious concrete pavements.

      (2)   In the event that any parcel of real estate subject to the plan
undergoes a change in use, redevelopment, or a modification, which change
requires a structural building permit and creates a need for new
infrastructure, an impact fee will only be assessed for the increase in the
burden on infrastructure.
      (3)   Any person or entity otherwise obligated to pay the fee established
by Ordinance 13-04-24, as amended, whose property was totally or partially
destroyed by fire, storm or other casualty beyond his/her/its control, shall be
exempt from said fee if he/she/it repairs or replaces the destroyed structure
without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden imposed by
the destroyed infrastructure. In the event of such additional burden, the fee
shall be calculated based only on the increased burden created by the
structure.
      (4)   For other specifics on the Park and Recreation Impact Fee, see
Ordinance 13-04-24 as amended, which terms are hereby incorporated by reference
as if fully set forth herein.
   (B)   Credits.
      (1)   Any person obligated to pay an impact fee pursuant to the terms of
this section may request and, if entitled, shall receive a credit against the
impact fee due in the manner and amount as provided in the Act (I.C. 36-7-4-
1300 et seq.), including I.C. § 36-7-4-1313 and I.C. § 36-7-4-1335. A request
for credit shall be present prior to the issuance of the Improvement Location
Permit. In the event the credit does not equal the amount of the total impact
fee pursuant to the calculation provided for in this section, the remaining
balance shall be due in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In addition, pursuant to I.C. § 36-7-4-1337, a person or entity
responsible for installing infrastructure or improvements and entitled to a
credit under this section may designate in writing a reasonable and feasible
method of allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be successors in
interest to the credits earned by the fee payer or others.
   (C)   Impact Fee Due Upon Issuance of an Improvement Location Permit.
      (1)   The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this section shall
be due and payable upon the issuance of a structural building permit by the
city. It is understood that the term "structural building permit" means a
building permit or other similar permits the city issues that are consistent
with how that that term is used in I.C. § 36-7-4-1323 and the Act, in that the
issuance of a structural building permit authorizes the applicant to commence
construction activities, structural or otherwise.
      (2)   If the fee payer requests, an impact fee on a development will be
assessed not later than 30 days, or 180 days for development identified under
I.C. § 36-7-4-1322(b), after the earlier of:
         (a)   The date the fee payer obtains an Improvement Location Permit
for the development; or
         (b)   The date that the fee payer voluntarily submits to the city a
development plan for the development and evidence that the property is properly
zoned for the proposed development. The plan shall be in the form prescribed by
the Noblesville Zoning Ordinance and shall contain reasonably sufficient detail
for the city to calculate the impact fee.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, "assessment" means the act of
calculating the amount of the impact fee which shall be due.
      (4)   For a phased development, the impact fee shall be prorated for
purposes of payment according to the impact of the parcel for which an
Improvement Location Permit is issued in relation to the total impact of the
development.
      (5)   In the event the total impact fee is greater than $5,000, the fee
payer may, at its option but no later than 30 days after the assessment,
request payments be made in equal payments according to an installment payment
plan. The installment payment plan shall include the following:
         (a)   A maximum of $5,000 or 5% of the impact fee, whichever is

   (I)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any fee payer who believes itself to be aggrieved by the
calculation of the impact fee may appeal from such calculation to the
Noblesville Impact Fee Review Board as set forth in the Act, and the
Noblesville Impact Review Board shall act upon and hear such appeal as provided
in the Act. The fee payer shall bear the burden of going forward with the
evidence and shall present evidence addressing either of the following:
         (a)   That a fact assumption used in determining the amount of the
impact fee is incorrect; or
         (b)   That the amount of the impact fee is greater than the amount
allowed under I.C. § § 36-7-4-1320, 1321, and 1322.
      (2)   An appeal under this section must be filed not later than 30 days
after the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit. The appeal shall be
initiated with the filing of a petition for review with the Noblesville City
Clerk's Office together with a filing fee in the amount of $100.
      (3)   The petition for review shall be in a form calculated to inform the
Noblesville Park Impact Fee Review Board of the nature of complaint, the
parties to the action, and relief requested. In addition, the petition shall
describe the new development on which the impact fee has been assessed, all
facts related to the assessment of the impact fee, and the reasons the
petitioner believes that the amount of the impact fee assessed is erroneous or
is greater than the amount allowed by the fee limitation set forth in the Act.
      (4)   The city shall not deny the issuance of an Improvement Location
Permit on the basis that the impact fee has not been paid, or condition
issuance of the permit on the payment of the impact fee. However, if the impact
fee totals $1,000 or less, the city may require the fee payer to pay the impact
fee or initiate an appeal under this section before the Improvement Location
Permit is issued.
   (J)   Conflicts with the Act. It is the intent of the city to comply with
the Act, and this section shall be construed in all respects to be consistent
with the Act. The substantive and procedural requirements of I.C. §§ 36-7-4-
1300 et seq. shall control in the event of conflicts, which are unintended by
the Council. Any provisions of the Act required to be included in or a part of
this section are hereby deemed incorporated herein and adopted as a part
hereof.
