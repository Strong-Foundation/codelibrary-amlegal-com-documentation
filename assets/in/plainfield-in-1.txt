chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Plainfield Town
Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified ordinances” or

constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.

same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the

   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.

reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law, and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.

so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or

accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of

law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section

proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.

(Ord. 15-2017, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 34.003 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to establish an investment
committee, provide investment objectives and guidelines for the management of
public funds, to safeguard funds on behalf of the town, to assure the
availability of funds when needed, and, at all times, invest according to and
consistent with state law, I.C. 5-13-9 et seq., as amended.
   (B)   Scope. This policy applies to the investment of all funds, unless the
investment of certain defined funds are governed by a separate statute or
agreement. The town may consolidate all cash and reserve balances, except for
cash in certain restricted and special funds, to maximize investment earnings
and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, safekeeping and
administration. Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based
on their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
   (C)   General objectives. The primary objectives of investment activities
shall be safety, liquidity, and return:
      (1)   Safety. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital in the overall investment portfolio. The
objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
         (a)   Credit risk.  The town will minimize credit risk, which is the
risk of loss of all or part of the investment portfolio due to the failure of
the security issuer or backer, by limiting investments to the types of
securities as listed in division (F) of this section and by diversifying the
investment portfolio so that the impact of potential losses from any one type
of security or from any one individual issuer will be minimized.
         (b)   Interest rate risk. The town will minimize interest rate risk,
which is the risk that the market value of securities in the investment
portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by structuring the
investment portfolio so that security maturities match cash requirements for
ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open
market prior to maturity.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
This is accomplished by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities
mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands.
      (3)   Return. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to
the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core investments are
limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair
return relative to the risk being assumed.
   (D)   Standards of care.
      (1)   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment
officials shall be the “uniform prudent investor act” standard and shall be
applied in the context of managing an overall investment portfolio. The
Investment Officer (defined below) and its designees acting in accordance with
written procedures and this policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in
accordance with the terms of this policy.
      (2)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. The Investment Committee (defined
below), the Investment Officer and its designees involved in the implementation
of the Investment Plan (defined below) shall refrain from personal business
activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the
investment portfolio, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. The Investment Committee, the Investment Officer and its designees
shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they
conduct business, in accordance with applicable laws and this policy. The
Investment Committee, the Investment Officer and its designees shall further
disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to
the performance of the investment portfolio. The Investment Committee, the
Investment Officer and its designees shall refrain from undertaking personal
investment transactions with the same individuals or businesses with whom
business is conducted on behalf of the Town.
      (3)   Delegation of authority.
         (a)   Authority to manage the investment portfolio is granted to the
Investment Committee and shall consist of a five member team:
            1.   The Clerk-Treasurer,
            2.   The Town Manager,
            3.   The Assistant Town Manager,
            4.   The Town Council President and
            5.   Staff Accountant.
         (b)   The town shall defend and hold harmless the Investment
Committee, the Investment Officer and its designees from and against any and
all claims, losses, costs or damages (including, without limitation, attorney's
fees) they may incur relating to or arising out such person's actions pursuant
to this section, except to the extent caused by such person's gross negligence
or willful misconduct.
      (4)   Investment Committee duties. The Investment Committee shall meet
quarterly to discuss performance of investments, ongoing cash needs, determine
the portfolio amount and to create, review and update an Investment Plan. The
investment portfolio amount will be an amount that the Investment Committee
deems acceptable to invest pursuant to the Investment Plan which shall be
approved by the Investment Committee. The Investment Plan shall detail the
percentage of the investment portfolio to be invested in different types of
securities and the terms for each investment. The Clerk-Treasurer shall be the
Investment Officer and will be responsible for the execution of the Investment
Plan and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of any
persons designated by the Investment Officer to carry out the Investment Plan.
No person may engage in an investment transaction that is not provided for in
the Investment Plan.
   (E)   Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. A
list will be maintained of local financial institutions that are approved
depositories for the receipt of public funds according to the State Board for
Depositories. The town may pass a resolution pursuant to I.C. 5-13-9-
5 expanding the list of approved financial institutions to include all Indiana
depositories approved for the receipt of public funds according to the Indiana
State Board for Depositories.

meet ongoing obligations.
         (b)   The town may adopt an ordinance, pursuant to I.C. 5-13-9-5.7,

§ 34.204 DEPRECIATION METHODS AND SALVAGE VALUE.
   (A)   Depreciation represents the recognition of the cost of an asset over
time by calculating its estimated loss in value during each year. Generally, at
the end of the asset's life, the sum of the amounts charged for depreciation in
each year (accumulated depreciation) will equal the original cost less salvage
value.
   (B)   The salvage value of an asset is the value it is expected to have when
it is no longer useful for its intended purpose. The town assumes a salvage
value of $0 but may evaluate on an asset-by-asset basis.
   (C)   The town depreciates the majority of its capital assets using the
straight-line method. Under this method, the same amount of depreciation is
deducted from the value of an asset every year for its useful life. The town
takes the full year of depreciation of a capital asset in the year of
acquisition and recognizes no salvage value (book value of a capital asset
after all depreciation has been fully expensed). Land and Construction in
Progress are capital asset categories that are not depreciated. Construction in
Progress assets become another category of assets once the asset is
substantially ready to be placed in service.
    (D)   The town depreciates its infrastructure capital assets using the
group or composite methods of depreciation. The group or composite methods of
depreciation apply a single straight-line depreciation rate and average useful
life to the calculation of depreciation for a group of assets.
    (E)   Estimated Useful Lives.  
       (1)   Land - N/A
      (2)   Buildings and Building Improvements - 50 years.

Note:
- Plan review: we review all of the building plans for commercial properties, multi-tenant (hotel, motel and assisted
living) and tenant improvement plans for life safety, fire suppression and fire department access. This takes between 5 to
10 hours per plan depending on the size of the facility. This includes TAC meetings.
- Working structure fires fee is to be billed to the insurance company for the structure and not the home owner. The
majority of all insurance company allows for this fee. (Based on state fire marshal fee schedule).
- All CPR instruction costs are per person.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly
owned treatment works for the Town of Plainfield (“Plainfield” or “town”) and
enables the town to comply with all applicable state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) Part 403). The
objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the publicly owned treatment works;
      (3)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works;
and
      (6)   To enable the town to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is
subject.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all direct and indirect users of the
publicly owned treatment works, including persons or entities outside the town
who are, by contract or agreement with the town, users of the publicly owned
treatment works. The chapter authorizes the establishment of a pretreatment
program; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein and fines and other remedies for
violation of the chapter.
   (C)   Unless otherwise defined herein, terms shall have the meanings adopted
in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, American
Waterworks Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 136. Waste constituents and characteristics shall be
measured by standard methods unless a mutually agreed upon acceptable
alternative method is adopted by agreement of the permittee and the permitting
authority or any other method is established by federal or state regulatory
agencies. Monitoring and metering shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.002 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the Utility Board created in §
50.04 shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Utility Board or the
Superintendent may be delegated to other town personnel or qualified
contractors.
   (B)   The town will maintain sufficient resources and qualified personnel to
carry out the non-delegated pretreatment program in accordance with 327 I.A.C.
5-19-3.
   (C)   If any provision of this chapter is invalidated by an court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected and
shall continue in full force and effect.

replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an existing source; or
         (c)   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of
an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should
be considered.
      (2)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the

the violation. Re-sampling by the industrial user is not required if the
Superintendent performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month,
or if the Superintendent performs sampling at the user between the time when
the initial sample was conducted and the time when the user or the
Superintendent receives the results of this sampling, or if the Superintendent
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.096 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the Superintendent, the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and
the IDEM, Office of Solid and Hazardous Waste, in writing, of any discharge
into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name
of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
51.099. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
51.095,
51.097, and
51.098.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any such hazardous wastes do not
require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Superintendent, the
EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and IDEM, Office of Solid and
Hazardous Waste, in writing, of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 51.097 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.098 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows; for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sample
collection techniques.

§ 51.099 RECORDKEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices. Records shall include the date,
exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking
the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the
analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or the town, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.

information about each industrial user that discharges into the POTW. An
industrial survey will be conducted at a minimum frequency of once every two
years.
   (B)   Information concerning any industrial user commencing or ceasing
discharge shall be updated on the industrial survey immediately. The
Superintendent will notify the PUWWS of any new industrial user commencing
discharge into the POTW within 30 days of becoming aware of the new user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.112 RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent or his or her agent will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   (B)   The Superintendent or his or her agent shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
   (C)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated at least annually to insure their accuracy.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user

believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the town designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Hendricks County Circuit Court in Danville, Indiana.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 51.115 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs and from the Superintendent’s inspection and sampling activities shall
be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent,
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 51.125 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent or the Council to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.126 AGREED ORDERS.
   The Council may enter into agreed orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
51.128 and
51.129 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.127 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear
before the Council and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action,
and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, the Superintendent or the Council taking any other action against the
user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.128 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the Superintendent or the Council taking
any other action against the user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.129 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, the Superintendent or the Council taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.130 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Superintendent or the Council finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Superintendent or the Council may impose a fine of at least
$1,000 per day, per violation, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(l)(vi)(A),
but no more than $2,500 per day, per violation for a first violation nor more
than $7,500 per day, per violation for subsequent violations, in accordance
with I.C. 36-l-3-8(a)(10)(B). Fines and regulations relating to illicit
discharges to the storm sewer system are outlined in the Town Drainage
Ordinance.
   (B)   When the Superintendent or the Council finds that a user has falsified
any information provided to the Superintendent, the town, IDEM, or the EPA, the
Superintendent or the Council may fine such user in an amount not to exceed
$2,500 as provided by I.C. 36-1-3-8. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis.
   (C)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8% per month. A lien against the user’s
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (D)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request with
the Superintendent or the Council, whichever assessed the fine, requesting the
reconsideration of the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within
30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Council
may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Superintendent or the Council may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (E)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, the Superintendent, the Board, or the Council taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.131 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
formal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent also may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as are deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
51.132 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
51.127 or
51.132.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 06-2017, passed 5-22-2017)
§ 51.132 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
51.025 through
51.030.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
51.127 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, the
Superintendent or the Council taking any other action against the user.

operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The user provided the Superintendent with a verbal notification of
the upset within two hours of becoming aware of the upset; and
      (4)   The user submitted the following information to the Superintendent
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of their treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provisions of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior written notice to the Superintendent at least ten days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within two
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission also
shall be provided to the Superintendent within five days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within two
hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(l) of this section.

PROGRAM FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM
§ 52.001 DEFINITION OF CROSS CONNECTION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement between two
otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the town
water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or
questionable safety, or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow
from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure
differential between the two systems.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-115) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983)
§ 52.002 INTERCONNECTIONS.
   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be established
or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No interconnection
shall be established whereby potable water from a private auxiliary, or
emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the town
may enter the supply or distribution system of said municipality, unless such
private auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of connection and
use of such supply be approved by the Municipal Water Department and by the
Environmental Management Board in accordance with Rule 320 I.A.C. 3-9.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-116) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.003 INSPECTIONS AND REINSPECTIONS.
   It shall be the duty of the Municipal Water Department to cause inspections
to be made of all properties served by the public water system where cross
connections with the public water system is deemed possible. The frequency of
inspections and reinspections based on potential health hazards involved shall
be as established by the Town Council.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-117) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983)
§ 52.004 ACCESS AND REFUSE.
   Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Municipal Water
Department shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to
examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the
town for cross connections. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of access or refusal of requested pertinent information shall be deemed
evidence of the presence of cross connections.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-118) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983)
§ 52.005 DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE.
   The Municipal Water Department is authorized and directed to discontinue
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this
subchapter exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice is served on
the owner, lessee or occupants of the property or premises where a violation is
found or suspected to exist. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with
the provisions of this subchapter.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-119) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983)
§ 52.006 EMERGENCY DISCONTINUANCE; HEARING.
   If it is deemed by the Municipal Water Department that a cross connection or
an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate
action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk-Treasurer
of the town and delivered to the consumer’s premises, service may be
immediately discontinued. The consumer shall have an opportunity for hearing
within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.
(1991 Draft Code, § 9-120) (Ord. 7-83, passed 11-14-1983)

   This chapter and all ordinances supplemental or amendatory hereto, shall be
known as the “Drainage Chapter”.
(Ord. 17-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 54.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to prescribe the conditions under
which land use changes from open or agricultural to a more urbanized use may
take place with regard to allowable storm water release rate and to prescribe
the provision for erosion control measures.
(Ord. 17-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 54.03 POLICY STATEMENT.
   It shall be the policy of the town that the storage and controlled release
of storm water runoff shall be required for any new development, redevelopment
and new construction located within the town not exempt under this chapter. No
building permit shall be issued for the construction or the extension of any
proposed or existing building in the town until the required drainage plans
have been approved in writing by the Town Engineer, except for the exceptions
listed in §
54.06.
(Ord. 17-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 54.04 ALLOWABLE STORM WATER RELEASE RATE.
   The release rate of storm water from development, redevelopment and new
construction may not exceed the storm water runoff from the land area in its
present state of development. The developer shall submit to the Town Engineer,
detailed computations of runoff before and after development, redevelopment or
new construction which demonstrate that runoff will not be increased to the
extent that the peak runoff after development, redevelopment or new
construction for the 100-year return period storm of critical duration does not
exceed the runoff before development, redevelopment or new construction for the
ten-year return period storm. The critical duration storm is that storm
duration which requires the greatest detention storage.
(Ord. 17-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 54.05 SUBMITTALS.
   The preparation of and the submittal of calculations, specifications and
drawings detailing the provisions for the design and construction of drainage,

§ 55.02 PARTIES DEFINED.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CUSTOMER. The individual, firm, corporation, government agency or other
entity being supplied by the water utility via a connection.
   WATER UTILITY. The town municipal waterworks.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to prescribe construction and
maintenance requirements for connections to the water utility.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.04 MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Whenever service is to be provided to a customer, the water utility
main shall be extended across the full length of the addressed side of the
customer’s property. In the case of a corner lot with an extension originating
from the non-addressed side of the property, the requirement to extend across
the full length of the addressed side of the property will require that the
extension be constructed across the full length of both the non-addressed side
and the addressed side of the property. All costs associated with the
construction of the water utility main shall be paid by the customer.
   (B)   All mainline water mains whether public or private shall be a minimum
of eight inches in diameter except dead-end mainline water mains serving
permanent residential cul-de-sacs a maximum of 400 feet in length and with a
maximum of 12 equivalent dwelling units may be six inches in diameter. Domestic
service connections shall be sized as prescribed by the water utility. It shall
be the customer’s responsibility to coordinate sizing of each extension and
connection with the water utility. In the event that the water utility requires
mains to be sized in excess of eight inches in diameter, the water utility may
participate in the material cost of the size increase.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.05 METERING.
   Connections to the water utility shall be metered as prescribed by the water
utility. Meters shall be located adjacent to the addressed side of the
customer’s property. Unless specifically stated otherwise in the town
standards, all meters and appurtenances shall be furnished and installed by the
customer.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.06 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   For connections for owner occupied residential structures which are
accepted by the water utility and whose meter pit is located immediately
adjacent to the right-of-way in accordance with town standards, the water
utility will maintain the meter and that portion of the connection from the
water utility main to the meter pit and the customer shall maintain the meter
appurtenances and the remaining portion of the connection.
   (B)   For connections for nonresidential structures, for connections for
non-owner occupied residential structures, or for connections that the water
utility elects to allow meters to remain or to be installed at locations not in
accordance with town standards, the water utility will maintain the meter and
that portion of the connection from the water utility main to the curb stop and
the customer shall maintain the meter appurtenances and the remaining portion
of the connection.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.07 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   The materials, design and construction of connections shall be in accordance
with town standards and shall be subject to review and comment by the water
utility. Connections which serve multi-family residential property or are
required to cross property lines shall be provided within a drainage and
utility easement throughout the entire system.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.08 FIRE PUMP AND STORAGE UTILIZATION.
   (A)   It is recognized that the water utility must limit the allowable flow
to that flow which maintains 20 pounds per square inch pressure in water
utility main. The water utility typically can provide approximately 1,500
gallons per minute at 20 pounds per square inch.
   (B)   Private fire pumps and private water storage will typically be
required in cases where greater than the allowable flow and/or pressure is
required for a connection. The minimum requirement for private water storage
shall be based upon the requirement for the fire pump to be tested at 150% of
its rated capacity. Thus, the rated capacity of a fire pump system absent
private water storage shall be two-thirds of the allowable flow resulting in a
typical rated capacity of 1,000 gallons per minute. The water utility requires
that all private fire pump systems be provided with a pressure sensing control
device which automatically throttles the flow via a control valve placed on the
discharge side of the fire pump. Connections which require fire pumps and/or
water storage shall be independent and specific to each building. The customer
shall provide the water utility with the necessary observations and design
calculations such that the meter and connection sizing can be coordinated.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.09 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Refer to 327 I.A.C. 8-10 and to Ordinance 9-97, “An Ordinance for
Cross Connection Control of the Public Water System” for additional
requirements.
   (B)   Whenever a cross connection control device of any kind is required,
by-passing shall be prohibited unless the by-pass is provided with a similar
cross connection control device as the by-pass constitutes a cross connection.
All cross connection devices shall be inspected/tested by a registered
inspector at the time of installation and at intervals required by this
section. Reports of all inspections and tests shall be submitted to the water
utility and to the customer within 30 calendar days of the inspection or test.
The location and specification of cross connection control devices shall be as
required by the water utility.
   (C)   Air gaps shall terminate a minimum of two pipe diameters of the
discharge pipe or six inches, whichever is the lesser, above the maximum
recorded flood or above the rim of receiving vessel, whichever is the higher.
Air gaps shall be inspected at intervals not exceeding 12 months to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Reduced pressure principle backflow preventers shall be installed
horizontally, with no plug or additional piping affixed to the pressure
differential relief valve port, and with the pressure differential relief valve
port a minimum of 12 inches above floor level. Additionally, the device must be
installed at a location where any leakage from the pressure differential relief
valve port will be noticed, and that allows access to the device for
maintenance and testing from floor level, and that will not subject the device
to flooding, excessive heat or freezing. Reduced pressure principle backflow
preventers shall be tested at intervals not exceeding six months.
   (E)   Double check valve assemblies shall be installed horizontally at a
location that allows access to the device for maintenance and testing from
floor level and that will not subject the device to excessive heat or freezing.
Double check valve assemblies shall be tested at intervals not exceeding 12
months.
   (F)   Pressure type vacuum breakers shall be installed as near as possible
to the irrigation facility, at a location that allows access to the device for
maintenance and testing from floor or ground level and that will not subject
the device to flooding, excessive heat or freezing. Additionally, the device
must be installed with its centerline or datum point a minimum of 12 inches
above: the floor level, the highest downstream shut-off valve, and the highest
downstream overflow rim or discharge point. Pressure type vacuum breakers shall
be tested at intervals not exceeding six months.
   (G)   Except for connections for facilities which present a “cross
connection hazard” as defined by 327 I.A.C. 8-10, connections to the water
utility shall have double check valve assemblies between the water utility and
the customer.
   (H)   Connections for facilities which present a “cross connection hazard”
as defined by 327 I.A.C. 8-10 shall have an air gap or a reduced pressure
principle backflow preventer between the water utility and the customer or
component thereof which presents the “cross connection hazard”.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.10 SECONDARY SOURCES OF SUPPLY.
   Storage tanks used only to store water from the water utility for
firefighting which are constructed to maintain the bacteriological quality of
the water shall be isolated from the water utility by an air gap, reduced
pressure principle backflow preventer or double check valve assembly. Other
secondary sources of supply shall not be physically connected to a connection
served by the water utility.
(Ord. 19-97, passed 12-22-1997)
§ 55.11 LAND IRRIGATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   With regard to water used for land irrigation, relief from sewage
charges which are based upon metered flows of the water utility will not be
granted.
   (B)   Land irrigation facilities constructed after July 19, 1985 which
receive flow from the water utility, are buried below the ground and have
sprinkling outlets located less than six inches above grade shall be isolated
from the water utility by an air gap, reduced pressure principle backflow
preventer or pressure type vacuum breaker.

(Ord. 33-2006, passed 10-9-2006)
§ 56.02 POSTCONSTRUCTION STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN POLICY.
   (A)   Procedures shall be utilized to promote improved water quality, and a
Postconstruction Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan shall be submitted to
the town for review for each new and redevelopment site. The Plan must include
the following information:
      (1)   A description of potential pollutant sources from the proposed land
use that may reasonably be expected to add a significant amount of pollutants
to storm water discharges;
      (2)   Location, dimensions, detailed specifications and construction
details of all postconstruction storm water quality measures. Postconstruction
storm water quality measures shall be located within platted drainage
easements, and adequate access easements or right-of-way shall be provided to
allow access to the postconstruction storm water quality measure locations;
      (3)   A description of measures that will be installed to control
pollutants in storm water discharges that will occur after construction
activities have been completed. Such practices include infiltration of run-off,
flow reduction by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions, buffer
strip and riparian zone preservation, filter strip creation, minimization of
land disturbance and surface imperviousness, maximization of open space and
storm water detention ponds;
      (4)   A sequence describing when each postconstruction storm water
quality measure will be installed;
      (5)   Storm water quality measures that will remove or minimize
pollutants from storm water run-off;
      (6)   Storm water quality measures that will be implemented to prevent or
minimize adverse impacts to stream and riparian habitat;
      (7)   An operations and maintenance (O&M) manual that includes a
narrative description of the maintenance guidelines for all postconstruction
storm water quality measures to facilitate their proper long term function.
This O&M manual shall clearly state that the BMP shall be owned by the
developer/property owner, and that any and all maintenance and repair
activities shall be paid for by the owner. The requirements of the O&M manual
shall remain in effect regardless of change in ownership of the development. It
shall be the responsibility of the BMP owner to provide the O&M manual to
future parties who will assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance
of the postconstruction storm water quality measures;
      (8)   The town or its representatives shall have the right to access the
site for inspection of the storm water quality BMP. Any maintenance or repairs
that are required as a result of the town’s inspection shall be paid by the
owner;
      (9)   Supporting calculations and documentation demonstrating the
adequacy of the selected postconstruction storm water management measures in a
report that is signed and stamped by a professional engineer; and
      (10)   Any other information and provisions required by the town, or as
specified in the town standards.
   (B)   For purposes of establishing a minimum storm water quality treatment
level required of new and redevelopment sites, the town’s storm water quality
policy shall be based on the reduction of total suspended solids (TSS) through
the use of best management practices (BMP). The proposed methodology within the
town’s MS4 area shall meet the requirements outlined within Chapters 8 and 9 of
the Hendricks County Storm Water Technical Standards Manual. The use of
specific BMP described within the Hendricks County Storm Water Technical
Standards Manual are required to be approved by the town, and a list of pre-
approved (as well as prohibited) BMP will be provided in the town standards. A
non pre-approved BMP may be proposed provided that independent, third-party
documentation is provided to the town which demonstrates that a minimum
treatment level of 80% TSS removal shall be achieved. Regardless of the BMP
utilized, each site shall incorporate methods to capture floatables (oils,
debris and the like).
   (C)   Where appropriate, any combination of storage, infiltration, filtering
or vegetative practices shall be used to reduce the impact of pollutants in
storm water run-off on receiving waters. In addition to the combination of
practices, the following requirements shall be utilized:
      (1)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection
areas;
      (2)   Discharges from an MS4 area will not be allowed directly into
sinkholes or fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge
meeting state ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 I.A.C. 2-11.
      (3)   Any storm water practice that is a Class V injection well must
ensure that the discharge from such practices meets state ground water quality
standards as referenced in 327 I.A.C. 2-11;
      (4)   As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through the
MS4 conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream bank
erosion;
      (5)   As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of appropriate
width shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches; and
      (6)   New retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal or
institutional refueling areas, or outlets and refueling areas that replace
their existing tank systems shall be required to design and install appropriate
practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in storm
water run-off.

STORM WATER EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
§ 56.15 INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons,
protect property and prevent damage to the environment in the town. This
subchapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development
or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the
movement of earth on land in the town.

§ 56.37 STORM WATER DEPARTMENT USER FEE STRUCTURE.
   (A)   (1)   For the purposes stated herein, there is hereby assessed a Storm
Water Department user fee to each Storm Water Department user within the sewage
works system service area of the town, in an amount as determined below.
      (2)   For purposes of imposing the Storm Water Department user fee, all
lots and parcels within the sewage works system service area are classified as
either:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   Nonresidential; or
         (c)   Undeveloped.
   (B)   Residential properties: monthly fees for residential properties
located within the sewage works system service area are hereby established as
one EDU multiplied by the base rate.
   (C)   Nonresidential properties: monthly fees for nonresidential properties
located within the sewage works system service area are hereby established as
the number of EDU each contains multiplied by the base rate. The number of EDU
is determined by dividing the total amount of impervious area by 3,000 square
feet, rounding the resulting calculated EDU to the next whole number, with two
being the lowest whole number for such purpose.
   (D)   Undeveloped properties: monthly fees for undeveloped properties
located within the corporate boundary of the town are hereby established as
$0.10 per acre, rounding to the next whole ten acre increment, with a minimum
charge being equal to the herein established base rate.

§ 56.38 FEE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Storm Water Department user fee shall be based on the relative
contribution of surface and storm water runoff from a given parcel to the
town’s storm water system. This Storm Water Department user fee rate is
designed to recover and be able to pay the cost of rendering storm water
service to the users of the storm water system, and shall be the basis for
assessment of the town’s Storm Water Department user fee. This rate is
established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably
expected variations in the cost of providing services, as well as variation in
the demand for services. This rate shall be evaluated annually as to its
sufficiency to satisfy the needs of the Storm Water Department.
   (B)   The following methods may be used to determine the nonresidential
factors:
      (1)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using on-site
measurements of the apparent outside boundaries of the parcel or impervious
area in or on such developed parcel, respectively, made by the town or on its
behalf;
      (2)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using the
dimensions of the parcel or impervious area in or on the parcels which are set
forth and contained in the records of the office of the County Assessor;
      (3)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the parcel size or
impervious area using aerial photography or photogrammertry, or using the
information and data from on-site measurements of like or similar property or
features or as contained in the records of the town or county; or
      (4)   Computation of parcel size or impervious area using data provided
by the owner, tenant or developer.
   (C)   The authorized official may require additional information as
necessary to make the determination.

PARK IMPACT FEE
§ 97.085 LIMITATION ON IMPOSITION OF IMPACT FEE.
   This subchapter shall expire and become void five years after its effective
date as required by I.C. 36-7-4-1340, unless action is undertaken to extend its
life consistent with the provisions of said code section which contemplates a
replacement ordinance.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.086 ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPACT ZONE.
   (A)   There is hereby established one park and recreational infrastructure
impact zone, the borders of which are co-terminus with the existing corporate
borders of the town, and, as they may be extended from time to time through
annexation, and, over which the town exercises planning and zoning
jurisdiction. In this regard, the Town Council specifically finds that there is
a functional relationship between the components of the Park and Recreation
Master Plan and Infrastructure Improvement Plan and that such park and
recreational plan provides a reasonably uniform benefit to all of the citizens
throughout the impact zone as of the adoption of this subchapter. The Town
Council further finds that all areas within the impact zone are contiguous as
required in I.C. 36-7-4-1316. Except as provided below, this subchapter shall
apply uniformly to all residential developments within the impact zone hereby
established for which the town may require a structural building permit and
which creates a need for new and additional park and recreational
infrastructure.
   (B)   This subchapter shall not apply to:
      (1)   Developments meeting the requirements set forth in I.C. 36-7-4-1322
(g);
      (2)   Improvements which do not require a structural building permit;
      (3)   Improvements which do not create a need for new and additional
infrastructure, including the erection of a sign, construction of accessory
buildings, structures or fences or the alteration, renovation or expansion of
an improvement where the use, or intensity thereof, has not changed;
      (4)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed improvement,
provided that the replacement improvement does not create a need for new and
additional infrastructure over and above the infrastructure needed by the
original improvement prior to the destruction or partial destruction thereof;
and
      (5)   Nonresidential development.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.087 ZONE IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   As a pre-condition to the adoption of this subchapter, the Town
Council undertook a comprehensive and detailed park and recreational impact
analysis through the employment for that purpose of Baker Tilly Investment
Advisors. The Town Council does now find that the resulting study and data base
constitute a sufficient study to constitute a Zone Improvement Plan. The Town
Council does hereby adopt the Zone Improvement Plan and Special Purpose Report
- Zone Improvement Plan prepared by Baker Tilly Investment Advisors, and dated
according to its most recent update, June 7, 2022, as its Zone Improvement Plan
and finds in this regard that said Zone Improvement Plan does contain the
following elements:
      (1)   Reasonable estimates relating to the nature and location of
development that is expected within the impact zone during the planning period,
which, for the purposes of this subchapter is defined to be a period of five
years commencing with the date of adoption hereof;
      (2)   A reasonable determination of the community level of service for
the impact zone;
      (3)   A reasonable determination of the current level of service provided
within the impact zone;
      (4)   A reasonable estimate of the nature, location, sequencing and
timing of the park and recreational requirements and costs necessary to provide
the community level of service for the developments contemplated in division
(A)(1) above;
      (5)   A reasonable estimate of the share of the park and recreational
costs identified in division (A)(4) above that will be used to:
         (a)   Raise the current level of service for existing development or
provide service to existing development; or
         (b)   Provide service to new development.
      (6)   A reasonable estimate of revenues that:
         (a)   Are from sources other than impact fees; and
         (b)   Will be used to finance the cost identified in division (A)(5)
(a) above.
      (7)   A description of the nature and location of existing infrastructure
in the impact zone; and
      (8)   A general description of the sources and amounts of money used to
pay for infrastructure during the previous five years.
   (B)   In addition, the Town Council does hereby specifically adopts the Zone
Improvement Plan as an official part of the Comprehensive Plan of the town,
pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-500 et seq.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.088 ESTABLISHMENT OF PARK AND RECREATIONAL IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   Based upon the Park and Recreation Master Plan and Infrastructure
Improvement Plan and Baker Tilly Municipal Advisors Special Purpose Report -
Zone Improvement Plan previously referred to and which is made a part of this
subchapter, the Town Council determines that the cost per detached single-
family housing unit is in the amount of $2,533; the cost per duplex unit, condo
unit, townhome unit and apartment unit is in the amount of $1,723, and that
said costs are to take effect beginning in 2023. The Town Council does hereby
make as a part of the record of these proceedings, all of the data collected,
the calculations made, and the conclusions reached by the Town Council in the
process of developing the Zone Improvement Plan.
   (B)   In the event that any parcel of real estate considered in the creation
of the Zone Improvement Plan undergoes a change in use, redevelopment or a
modification which requires a structural building permit, and creates a need
for new infrastructure, an impact fee will only be assessed for the increase in
the burden on infrastructure.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.089 CREDIT IN LIEU OF PAYMENT; EXEMPTIONS.
   Credits against impact fees otherwise due shall be allowed pursuant to this
section for all infrastructure and improvements constructed or furnished in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-4-1313, I.C. 36-7-4-1335 since January 1, 1989 and
I.C. 36-7-4-1336. In addition, a fee payer or other person or entity
responsible for installing infrastructure or improvements may designate in
writing a method of allocating its credits to future fee payers who may be
successors in interest to the credits earned by the fee payer or others, as
part of the certification provided for above. Any person or entity otherwise
obligated to pay the fee established by this subchapter whose property was
totally or partially destroyed by fire, storm or other casualty beyond their
control, shall be exempt from said fee if they repair or replace the destroyed
structure without creating a burden on infrastructure greater than the burden
imposed by the destroyed structure. In the event of such additional burden, the
fee shall be calculated based only on the increased burden created by the
structure.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.090 IMPACT FEE DUE UPON ISSUANCE OF STRUCTURAL BUILDING PERMIT.
   (A)   The impact fee imposed pursuant to the terms of this subchapter shall
be due and payable upon the issuance of a structural building permit by the
town. In this regard, it is understood that the structural building permit is
synonymous with the term “structural building permit” as that term is used in
I.C. 36-7-4-1323, in that the issuance of a structural building permit
authorizes the applicant to commence construction activities, structural and
otherwise. The entire fee which is calculated pursuant to the terms of this
subchapter shall be due at said time unless the amount of the fee upon
calculation is greater than $5,000, in which case an installment plan may be
requested by the applicant in accordance with the terms set forth in I.C. 36-7-
4-1324(a), I.C. 36-7-4-1324(b), I.C. 36-7-4-1324(c) and I.C. 36-7-4-1324(d).
The Town Impact Fee Review Board shall establish specific rules consistent with
said code provisions for installment payments. The interest rate on any
installment plan or deferred payment shall be the pre-judgment rate of interest
set forth in the Indiana Code as from time to time amended.
   (B)   If a fee payer requests, the amount of the impact fee shall be
assessed upon the voluntary submission of a development plan or upon the
issuance of the improvement location permit, whichever is earlier. For purposes
of this section, ASSESSMENT means the act of calculating the amount of the
impact fee which shall be due. The town shall make such assessment within 30
days of the date of such voluntary request or at the issuance of the
improvement location permit with or without a request.
(Ord. 30-2022, passed 6-27-2022)
§ 97.091 LIEN RIGHTS ESTABLISHED.
   Pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-1325, the town acquires a lien against the real
estate which is the subject of the impact fee. The town hereby incorporates
I.C. 36-7-4-1325(a), I.C. 36-7-4-1325(b), I.C. 36-7-4-1325(c), I.C. 36-7-4-1325
(d), I.C. 36-7-4-1325(e) and I.C. 36-7-4-1325(f) into this subchapter. Upon
adoption, this subchapter shall be recorded, and, thereafter, it shall
constitute constructive notice of the lien rights of the town. The town may, in
its discretion, file a specific instrument setting forth its lien rights with
respect to a parcel of real estate which is the subject of an installment
payment of an impact fee, and such instrument shall constitute actual notice in
addition to the constructive notice provided for by the recording of this
subchapter.

town has no control. The Town Council shall, therefore, when the town
determines that circumstances require, cause a review to be made by town staff
or consultants as may be required, to determine the continuing validity of the
impact fee, the impact zone and the Zone Improvement Plan. The Town Council
shall consider and adopt such amendments as are necessary to cause a
substantive compliance with the rational nexus test to continue, to ensure that
procedural due process is maintained or enhanced and to insure that this

§ 111.088 BILLING AND PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The procedures for billing and collection for services shall be
prescribed by the Town Council and administered by the Clerk-Treasurer of the
town.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the patient receiving emergency
medical ambulance services or the patient’s legal representative to satisfy the
charges for the services rendered.
   (C)   All billing shall be sent to the patient, the patient’s legal
representative or named responsible party for the services rendered, except
where federal and/or state law dictates differently.
   (D)   The town is not a network provider for any private insurance companies
and therefore does not accept assignment for payment. In cases where employers
and or insurance carriers make only partial payments for services rendered, it
shall be the responsibility of the patient or the patient’s legal
representative to satisfy the remaining unpaid balance.
   (E)   The town is classified as a Medicare and Medicaid provider. As such,
the town will file claims on behalf of any patient eligible for Medicare and/or
Medicaid. The town cannot bill the patient for a balance greater than the co-
payment, patient responsibility and/or spend-down established by Medicare and/
or Medicaid. In the event that secondary and/or supplemental insurance is
available, the town will request that the patient file a claim with any
secondary and/or supplemental insurance for satisfaction of the remaining
balance. Any co-payment, patient responsibility and/or spend-down balance not
paid by the secondary and/or supplemental insurance will be the responsibility
of the patient as permitted by Medicare and/or Medicaid.
   (F)   The town has not entered into any agreements with the entities to
which the town provides paramedic assistance. Therefore, all “paramedic
assists” for patients who are eligible for Medicare will be filed with Medicare
for consideration of payment. Any denied claims from Medicare shall be the
responsibility of the patient as permitted by Medicare.

cannot be completed prior to the completion of work during each working day,
the cuts shall be temporarily backfilled with a compacted aggregate base
material or covered with a steel plate of sufficient size and thickness to
safely carry the traffic. The steel plate shall be properly fastened down so as
not to create any safety hazard for vehicles traveling upon it. A steel plate
shall also be used to cover any concrete area during the curing period for such
concrete.

substance from any dry-well, cesspool, septic tank or other underground place
in the town, used for the purpose of collecting offal, refuse, excreta or other
waste substance or matter, such person, firm or corporation shall first make
application to the Clerk-Treasurer of said town for permit so to do. Such
application shall state the location of such dry-well, cesspool, septic tank or
other underground place; the day or days and the time when such substance
therefrom is desired to be removed or cleaned out; the person or persons who
will perform the work and labor; and the price to be charged therefor or the
price per unit or other basis upon which a charge therefor is to be made. Upon
such written application being made, and no reason appearing why a permit
should not be issued, the Clerk-Treasurer shall issue a written permit allowing
or permitting such person, firm or corporation to clean out or remove substance
from said dry-well, cesspool, septic tank or other underground place, at a time
and the place designated in such permit.
(1991 Draft Code, § 7-85) (Ord. 11, 1949, passed 4-11-1949)
§ 150.121 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to clean out or
remove substance from any dry-well, cesspool, septic tank or other underground
place used for the purpose of collecting refuse, offal, excreta or other waste
substance without applying for and obtaining a written permit from the Clerk-
Treasurer as provided in §
150.120.
(1991 Draft Code, § 7-86) (Ord. 11, 1949, passed 4-11-1949) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter, for which no other
penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   (1)   If any person, firm or corporation shall violate any of the
provisions of §§
150.001 through
150.024, or shall do any act prohibited herein, or shall fail to perform any
duty lawfully enjoined, within the time prescribed by the Building
Commissioner, or shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any lawful order given
by the Building Commissioner in connection with the provisions of §§
150.001 through
150.024 for each such violation, failure or refusal, such person, firm or
corporation may be fined up to and including the maximum penalty prescribed by
state statute. Each day of such unlawful activity as is prohibited by the first
sentence of this section shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   Any person who violates §
150.017 may be subject to a fine equal to $1 per square foot. The total square
foot of the building occupied in violation of §

$2,500 per day. Each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
      (3)   Any person who violates §
150.019 may be subject to a fine of $25. Each day the violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   (1)   No person, firm or corporation, whether as owner, lessee,
sublessee or occupant, shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move,
improve, remove, demolish, equip, use, occupy or maintain any building or
premises, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation
of any of the provisions of §§

to $2,500 per day may be entered for a violation of §§
150.070 through
150.074.
      (2)   Subject to removal. A home, sited upon property in violation of §§
150.070 through
150.074, shall be subject to removal from such property. However, the home
owner must be given a reasonable opportunity to bring the property into
compliance before action for removal can be taken. If action finally is taken
by the appropriate authority to bring compliance, the expenses involved may be
made a lien against the property.
      (3)   Removal method. The Plan Commission or its designated Administrator
may institute a suit in an appropriate Court for injunctive relief to cause
such violation to be prevented, abated or removed.
(1991 Draft Code, § 7-55)

conviction shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $10. Provided, however, that
whenever any police officer shall find that any person has violated any
provision of §§
150.120 and
150.121, such officer shall notify such person by delivering to such person a
written notice stating the name of such person, the specific violation, the
date of such violation. Such notice shall be prepared in triplicate. One copy
shall be served on the violator; one copy shall be filed with the Clerk-
Treasurer; and one copy shall be retained by the officer. The copy served on
the violator shall state in substance that the violator or his or her
representative must appear at the office of the Clerk-Treasurer within 72 hours
of 4:00 p.m. following the service of said notice and have the privilege of
paying the sum of $2 in compromise and settlement of the penalty for the
violation charged in said notice. The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to accept
on behalf of the town any such offer to pay and settle such penalty pursuant to
§§
150.120 and
150.121. Such acceptance shall be effected by issuing to such violator a
receipt for the payment of the sum of $2 within the time stated in the notice,
such failure shall be deemed a rejection on the part of the violator of the
privilege to compromise and settle the claim of the town in payment of the
penalty as provided herein; and the Town Attorney shall prepare the necessary

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE,
OBJECTIVES AND DEFINITIONS
§ 152.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
    The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the
Town Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)    The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
   (F)    Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood
insurance program.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)    To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in floodplains; and
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.005 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of ZONES
A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within
this zone.
      (4)   ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor area
400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial
investment, may not be used for human habitation and be designed to have
minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are detached
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BOUNDARY RIVER.  The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between
Kentucky and Indiana.
   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   D ZONE. Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding
is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in this zone.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation or drilling
operations;
         (f)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information. This certification must be signed and sealed by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify elevation
information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM The first phase under which a community participates in
the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the community’
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic report
provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM
(where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD)
   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two
feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory
flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances and other applications of police power which control development in
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in
any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing
flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred to
as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance and floodplain management requirements.
   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING). A method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that
are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above
the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER). The exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and peculiar
to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to
bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation,
relocation, demolition or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will
include ICC coverage.
   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new
flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month
adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its  floodplain management
regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously
incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are
presented below:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An amendment by letter to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA
through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only
issued by FEMA.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations
and elevations.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support or basement entryway
immediately next to the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest of the following:
      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;
      (2)   The top of the basement floor;
      (3)   The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of
the structure;
      (4)   The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or
pillars;
      (5)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement,
below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic
flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a
minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area,
each shall have openings on exterior walls;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such
openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and,
         (c)   Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of
vehicles and building access.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market
will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent certified appraisal,
replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value) or adjusted
assessed values.
   MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to
people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of MITIGATION
is two-fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities
nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the
private insurance industry.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM OF 1929 (NGVD). As corrected in 1929, is a

to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-
prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
Town Council subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the
town are generally identified as such on the Hendricks County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 25, 2009 as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM
as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The ACTUAL START means the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of
piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations or the erection
of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START
OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.

or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial
damage” or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements.
   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because
the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in this
chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X ZONES (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type
of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND C.)

of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town, delineated as an “A Zone” on
the Hendricks County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated September 25, 2009 as well as any future updates, amendments, or
revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most
recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area
from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing
data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be
considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and subsequently approved.
   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification
on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of
any watercourse in known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data
available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided
the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square
mile.
   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more
restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized
for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all
previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

§ 152.024 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.025 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND ELEVATIONS.
   (A)    In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the
base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be
considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.026 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.027 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the town, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
or the state, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter
or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

§ 152.057 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
   (D)    Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
   (E)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/
or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
   (F)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA

(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.058 CRITICAL FACILITY.
   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.059 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
152.021, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure.
      (2)   However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if
fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.)
   (B)   (1)    No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in a
floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit,
provided the provisions contained in §§
152.055 through
152.062 have been met.
      (2)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any)
shall take precedence.
   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination
with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency
of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is
defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least
0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under
the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard
regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.060 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.
   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§
152.055 through
152.062 of this chapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.061 STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR
FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.
   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and comment;
      (2)    No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; and
      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or
floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§
152.055 through
152.062 of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the
floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream
of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall
require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in §§
152.055 through
152.062 have been met.
   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development shall not adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-
floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.062 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PRONE AREAS.
   All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or
where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as
required per §§
152.055 through
152.062.

(Ord. 01-2019, passed 5-13-2019)
§ 152.078 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship as defined by Indiana law; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §§
152.059 or
152.061(A) may be granted.
   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §§
152.059 or
152.061(A) will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
   (D)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
152.056 may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. (Refer to §
152.080)
   (G)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. (See §
152.079.)
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request. (See §
152.079.)

   (A)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest
floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be
given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall by recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.

§ 2.1D SPECIAL PROVISION FOR NONRESIDENTIAL INCREMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS.
      (1)   The secondary plat approval process for nonresidential incremental
subdivisions is intended to provide for the phased approval of nonresidential
lots of a size and configuration required to serve the needs of development
while safeguarding the needs and interests of the public for proper
infrastructure design and installation.
      (2)   Any nonresidential incremental subdivision electing to not utilize
this incremental secondary plat approval process set forth herein shall be
required to follow the full primary and secondary plat approval process
outlined above.
         (a)   Incremental approval process.
            1.   Any subdivider who proposes to utilize the incremental
approval process shall indicate the intention to utilize the incremental
approval process at the pre-filing conference for conceptual plat review with
staff as required below.
            2.   Any subdivision for nonresidential land uses may be divided
into two or more increments or phases for the purpose of secondary plat
approval. In connection with a primary plat approval intending to utilize the
incremental approval, the Plan Commission shall condition its primary plat
approval upon the following requirements:
               a.   All lots created by an incremental secondary plat shall
have either:
                  i.   Direct access to and from a public street; or
                  ii.   Gain access to and from a public street across a
perpetual recorded access easement through portions of the real estate included
in the primary plat.
               b.   All lots created by an incremental secondary plat shall
either contain within the limits of the incremental secondary plat or have
legal access to adequate infrastructure to accommodate the fully developed
needs of the incremental plat (i.e., storm water management, sanitary sewer,
water, electric, gas, telephone and the like).
            3.   The Plan Commission may impose any other reasonable conditions
on the primary plat approval of a nonresidential incremental subdivision deemed
necessary to assure the orderly development of the nonresidential incremental
subdivision. Such reasonable conditions may include the completion of, or
posting a bond or other surety in lieu thereof for, improvements necessary to
support each incremental secondary plat but which improvements may not be
located within the bounds of the proposed incremental secondary plat.
         (b)   Improvements in incremental secondary plats. Each incremental
secondary plat shall be considered a separate secondary plat and the recording
of easements, dedication of rights-of-way, infrastructure improvements or other
required improvements proposed in the remaining sections of the primary plat
may be deferred by the subdivider and completed in connection with the
appropriate future incremental secondary plat, provided, however, the recording
of easements, dedication of rights-of-way, construction of infrastructure
improvements or other required improvements proposed in the primary plat which
are determined by the Plan Commission as required to protect the public health,
safety and welfare may be required prior to approval of the proposed
incremental secondary plat.
         (c)   Filing requirements for nonresidential primary plats proposing
to utilize an incremental secondary plat approval process. Any subdivider who
proposes to utilize the incremental secondary plat approval process shall
indicate the intention to utilize the incremental secondary plat approval
process at the pre-filing conference for conceptual plat review and on the
application for a nonresidential primary plat.
         (d)   Review procedures for nonresidential primary plats proposing
incremental secondary plat approval.
            1.   The subdivider shall submit a sketch plan for the proposed
nonresidential subdivision for conceptual plat review by the staff at a pre-
filing conference prior to filing a petition for primary plat approval with the
Plan Commission.
            2.   Staff shall review the sketch plan and shall notify the
subdivider of any comments related to the design or contents of the sketch plan
within ten business days of the submittal for conceptual plat review.
            3.   Notwithstanding anything contained in this ordinance to the
contrary, neither the staff’s conceptual plat review of the sketch plan
submitted at a pre-filing conference nor staff’s comments to the petitioner
relating thereto shall be considered a denial, approval or decision concerning
the proposed primary plat.
            4.   Petitioner may modify the sketch plan and file a petition for
primary plat approval after the expiration of the ten business day period
referred to above.
         (e)   Incremental secondary plat approval. Incremental secondary plat
approval is hereby delegated to the Director, provided that any and all
conditions imposed by the Plan Commission on the primary plat have been fully
complied with by the subdivider.

   No part of the minimum lot area required under the applicable zoning
ordinance, zoning commitment, variance grant or development plan approval may
be satisfied by land that is under water. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of the lot from the street by which it has access, provisions
shall be made for the installation of a culvert or other appropriate structure,
of a design approved by the Town Engineer. If a subdivision contains an
existing or to be developed waterbody, watercourse, or portion thereof,
appropriate documentary assurances acceptable to the Plan Commission shall be
provided for the maintenance of such waterbody or watercourse.

      (1)   Addresses for all lots within a subdivision shall conform as
closely as practical to the address grid pattern established for the town. The
east/west baseline grid shall be Vine Street. The north/south baseline grid
shall be U.S. 40. Wherever possible, the grid pattern for new subdivisions
shall be laid out so as to reserve one address number for each 20 feet of
frontage of a lot. Addresses shall conform to the nearest number which
approximates the location of the proposed driveway, building or entrance
doorway on a lot. Numbers assigned to the west side of north/south streets and
the north side of east/west streets shall be even numbers. Numbers assigned to
east side of north/south streets and the south side of east/west streets shall
be odd numbers.

§ 3.3B GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET DESIGN.
   All streets, whether public or private, shall comply with the following
general requirements for street design.
      (1)   Street names. Streets which are extensions or a continuation of, or
obviously in alignment with, any existing streets, either constructed or
appearing on any validly recorded plat or survey, or valid plat previously
approved by the Plan Commission, shall bear the names of such existing streets.
Names for all other streets shall be sufficiently different in sound and in
spelling from other streets in the town or other nearby areas so as to avoid
confusion.
      (2)   Alleys. Alleys may be proposed in such instances where the use of
alleys was indicated on a development plan approved by the Plan Commission, or
where the development represents an in-fill situation and the use of alleys
would be compatible with the development pattern of the area surrounding the
proposed subdivision.
      (3)   Access to areas abutting thoroughfares. If the proposed subdivision
abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed primary arterial street,
secondary arterial street or limited access street, the street plan shall
provided vehicular access to each lot abutting such streets by one of the
following means:
         (a)   A frontage street running generally parallel to the primary,
secondary or limited access street and whose right-of-way is separate from the
right-of-way of such primary, secondary or limited access street;
         (b)   A local or collector street running generally parallel to the
primary, secondary or limited access street with the rear of the lots backing
up to the primary, secondary or limited access street and no access shall be
provided to the primary, secondary or limited access street; or
         (c)   A series of cul-de-sac streets, U-shaped streets or short loop
streets entered from and designed generally at right angles to a local or
collector street running generally parallel to the primary, secondary or
limited access street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto
the primary, secondary or limited access street.
      (4)   Secondary means of access.
         (a)   Secondary access to a subdivision. Any major residential
subdivision which contains 30 or more lots shall:
            1.   Provide a secondary means of access from an improved perimeter
public street; or
            2.   Provide a divided local collector street as the means of
access from an improved perimeter public street back to a point of intersection
with an internal street network where all lots can be accessed by more than one
direction.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2299.jpg]
 
   SECONDARY MEANS OF ACCESS
         (b)   Secondary access within a subdivision. Within a major
residential subdivision, no portion of the subdivision shall include more than
30 lots which cannot be accessed from more than one direction.
         (c)   Remote secondary access. Any major residential subdivision which
contains 60 or more lots shall provide a remote secondary means of access which
complies with the Town Access Control Ordinance and is separated from at least
one other access point into the subdivision by a distance apart equal to not
less than one-half of the length of the maximum overall diagonal dimension of
the property or area to be served, measured in a straight line between access
points.
         (d)   Exception. In any major residential subdivision where all
dwelling units within the subdivision are served by a residential sprinkler
system in compliance with either:
            1.   NFPA 13 Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems;
            2.   NFPA 13D Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in
One- and Two-Family Dwellings and Manufactured Homes; or
            3.   NFPA 13R Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in
Residential Occupancies up to and Including Four Stories in Height, the maximum
number of lots which may be developed without being required to provide a
remote secondary means of access shall be increased to 120 lots.
         (e)   Design of remote secondary access.
            1.   A remote secondary means of access may be designed as:
               a.   A dedicated public street; or
               b.   A gated or un-gated emergency vehicle access easement
providing direct access to an improved perimeter public street or connecting to
a public street in an abutting subdivision which provides access to an improved
perimeter public street.
            2.   If a remote secondary means of access is provided by way of an
emergency vehicle access easement, such emergency vehicle access easement shall
be designed to comply with the requirements for a “fire apparatus access road”,
including having a minimum pavement width of 20 feet and being constructed of a
heavy duty pavement section of asphalt, concrete or other driving surface
approved by the Town Fire Chief or his or her designee, and capable of
supporting an imposed load of fire apparatus weighing at least 75,000 pounds.
      (5)   Dead end streets. Permanently dead-end streets (except for cul-de-
sac streets provided in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance) shall
be prohibited. A temporary dead-end street may be permitted in any case in
which a street is proposed to be and should logically be extended beyond the
limits of the subdivision, but is not yet constructed beyond said subdivision
limits. The right-of-way of a temporary dead-end street shall extend to the
property line of the subdivision. An adequate easement for turn-around shall be
provided for any such temporary dead-end street which extends 250 feet or more,
with a temporary turn-around provided. A notation on the plat shall state that
the land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to the abutting
lots and property owners when the street is continued, constructed and, if a
public street, accepted by the town.
      (6)   Frontage on improved streets.
         (a)   No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be
subdivided shall have frontage on and gain access from:
            1.   An existing town, county or state street; or
            2.   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Plan Commission and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
         (b)   Such street must be improved as required by the rules,
regulations or specifications of the responsible agency, or be secured by a
performance bond as required by this ordinance, with the width of the right-of-
way and pavement to be in compliance with the thoroughfare and this ordinance.
      (7)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded and improved
to conform with the construction standards and specifications set forth the
town standards and in Table 3.3-A: Minimum Design Standards for Streets. Such
construction standards and specifications shall be indicated on construction
plans required prior to secondary plat approval and shall be approved as to
design and specification by the Town Engineer.
      (8)   Topography and arrangement.
         (a)   Streets shall be appropriately related to site topography. All
streets shall, wherever practical, be arranged so as to maximize the number of
lots located at, or above, the street grades. Street grades shall conform as
closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades
and sharp curves shall be avoided wherever practical.
         (b)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established in
the Thoroughfare Plan.
         (c)   Local streets shall be laid out to conform to as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient, safe and efficient access to the
subdivision.
         (d)   Proposed collector streets shall, where appropriate, be extended
to the boundary lines of the subdivision unless such extension is prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Plan
Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the purpose of
coordinating with existing street layouts or providing for the most
advantageous development of future tracts.
         (e)   Streets, access drives, driveways, interior access driveways and
interior access drives shall be planned in connection with the groupings of
buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of public or private
alleys, truck loading areas and truck maneuvering areas, walkways, bikeways and
parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types
of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
      (9)   Street signs, pavement markings and traffic control signs. The
subdivider shall provide street signs at every street intersection within the
subdivision. The subdivider shall also provide pavement markings and traffic
control signs at required locations. All street signs, pavement markings and
traffic control signs shall conform to the town standards and the Indiana
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways as published
by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
      (10)   Street lights. The subdivider shall provide and install street
lights within the subdivision to conform with the town construction standards
and specifications for street lights. Street light plans shall be approved by
the Town Council.
      (11)   Reserve strips. Except where specifically authorized by the Plan
Commission for the purpose of minimizing traffic conflicts with primary or
secondary arterial streets or railroads, the creation of reserve strips
adjacent to the right-of-way which may be used to deny access to a street shall
not be permitted.
      (12)   Arrangement of streets. In order to provide for the convenient
movement of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of
utilities or where such connection is in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan, streets shall be arranged so as to provide for the continuation of
collector streets and larger streets between adjacent subdivisions.
      (13)   Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets, when approved by the Plan
Commission, shall not normally be located nearer to a subdivision boundary than
50 feet. All cul-de-sac streets shall be provided with adequate rights-of-way
and pavement width in accordance with the design specifications of the town
construction standards and specifications set forth in the town standards and
Table 3.3-A: Minimum Design Standards for Streets. The Plan Commission may,
however, require the provision of appropriate easements between the end of the
cul-de-sac and the subdivision boundary necessary to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian ways or utilities. In no event shall a cul-de-sac
measure more than 800 feet in length, measured from centerline of an
intersecting street (excluding another cul-de-sac) to the center point of the
radius of the turn-around.
      (14)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Plan Commission
may authorize a new perimeter street around a proposed subdivision where the
subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required right-of-way width within
the boundary of said proposed subdivision.
      (15)   Widening and realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow street or when the Thoroughfare Plan indicates plans
for realignment or widening of a street that would required use of some of the
land in the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate that
portion of such existing street which is contained within the land subject to
the secondary plat of the subdivision to the full width required by this
ordinance, and improve such street as required by the Plan Commission. Land
reserved for any street purposes shall not be counted in satisfying the minimum
yard or lot area requirements of the Town Zoning Ordinance.
      (16)   Dedication. All public streets shall be dedicated to the town on
the secondary plat free and clear of all liens and encumbrances by use of the
following language: “All streets shown on this plat, and not heretofore
dedicated, are hereby dedicated to the Town of Plainfield, Indiana”.

ARTICLE 3.6. DRAINAGE
§ 3.6A GENERAL DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall not approve any subdivision which does
not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff channels or basins.
      (2)   The storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent
of any sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the rational
method, or other methods as approved by the Town Engineer, and a copy of the
design computations shall be submitted along with the construction plans.
      (4)   Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried
across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of greater that 400 feet
on local streets, 300 feet on collector streets, and as indicated by approved
calculations submitted to the Town Engineer based upon a ten year design storm
and maximum spread as provided by the Town Engineer on arterial streets.
Additional inlets shall be required when encroachment of storm water into the
street disrupts traffic under the ten year design storm.
      (5)   The subdivider shall provide a grading plan at a maximum scale of
one inch = 60 feet showing surface water drainage patterns on each lot and
street.
      (6)   The subdivider shall provide storm water conveyance facilities in
accordance with the town standards, Ord. 17-97, “Drainage and Erosion Control
Ordinance” as codified in §§
54.01 through
54.15 of this code of ordinances, and the Storm Water Drainage Manual by
Christopher B. Burke, Highway Extension and Research Project for Indiana
Counties and Cities, School of Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette,
Indiana.
(Ord. 22-97, passed - -1997; Ord. 4-2000, passed - -2000)
§ 3.6B NATURE OF STORM WATER FACILITIES.
      (1)   Location.
         (a)   The subdivider may be required by the Plan Commission to carry
away, by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist, either
previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way or in perpetual, unobstructed
easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the
town construction standards and specifications.
         (b)   1.   Whenever a change of land use occurs, concentrated storm
water discharge to adjacent areas shall not be permitted unless the discharge
is conveyed through a suitable drainage feature to:
               a.   An approved outlet within the right-of-way;
               b.   An existing drainage easement;
               c.   A defined drainageway as approved by the Town Engineer; or
               d.   An open ditch which appears as a dashed or solid blue line
on the 7.5 Minute Series Topographic Quadrangle Map as published by the United
States Geological Survey.
            2.   The drainage feature used to convey the site discharge to the
approved outlet shall be located in the right-of-way or easement of appropriate
width.
      (2)   Public storm sewers. With the exception of storm water conveyance
along nonresidential local streets within the I-2, I-3 and I-4 Districts, all
storm water conveyance within or parallel to and adjacent to the public right-
of-way shall be fully contained in storm sewers with an adequate and approved
outlet. Residential subdivisions containing lots of less than 15,000 square
feet and nonresidential subdivisions shall be provided with storm sewers to
convey all on-site drainage. However, on-site drainage swales with required
conveyance capacity of less than five cubic feet per second under the ten year
post-development design storm may be allowed.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert, storm sewer,
open ditch or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to
convey potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside
or outside the subdivision. The minimum conveyance provided for upstream, off-
site drainage areas shall be the runoff resulting from the 100-year storm over
the present state of upstream, off-site drainage areas. The conveyance provided
for upstream waters may be decreased to the extent that hydrograph routing and
detention on land controlled by the subdivider and dedicated to the town as a
drainage easement allows for decreased capacity; provided, that the runoff
resulting from the 100-year storm is staged less than one foot above the stage
on the natural drainage way at the interface of the development with the
upstream drainage area. Culvert capacities for conveyance under interior local,
collector and arterial streets without roadway overtopping shall be the runoff
resulting from the 25-year, 50-year and 100-year storms respectively over off-
site areas in present state and on-site areas in post development state.
Driveway culvert capacities shall be the capacities required for the street
classification to which the driveway connects. Greater culvert capacity shall
be required to protect the finished floor elevation of buildings from the post-
development 100-year storm when, in the opinion of the design engineer or the
Town Engineer, the finished floor elevation is threatened. It is recommended
that drainage of loading docks or other building features which are proposed at
an elevation lower than adjacent roadways be considered with respect to culvert
drainage impacts.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The release rate of storm
water from development, redevelopment and new construction shall not exceed the
storm water runoff rate from the land in its present state of development.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Areas which are not in the floodplain, but
which contain soils subject to flooding, may be approved for subdivision by the
Plan Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two
feet above the ponding levels.
      (6)   Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by
soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the County Soil and
Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type construction
unless the Plan Commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques
will be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem.
      (7)   Special flood hazard areas. If any portion of a proposed
subdivision lies within the floodplain, the subdivision shall comply with Ord.
25-2009, “Management of the Floodplain and Other Areas of Special Flood Hazard
of the Town of Plainfield”.
(Ord. 22-97, passed - -1997; Ord. 4-2000, passed - -2000)

      (1)   General requirements.
         (a)   When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be
provided granting or dedicating to the town said area in an amount conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and
construction as will be adequate for the purpose of accommodating drainage and
providing for the maintenance of the right-of-way.
         (b)   Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be
maintained as an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
         (c)   All storm water easements and drainage rights-of-way which are
to be dedicated to the town on the secondary plat shall use the following
language: “All storm water easements and drainage rights-of-way shown on this
plat are hereby dedicated to the Town of Plainfield, Indiana”.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual, unobstructed easements for drainage facilities measuring at least 15
feet in width shall be provided across property outside of street right-of-way
lines. All drainage easements shall provide access to a public street. Drainage
easements shall extend from the street to a natural watercourse or to other
drainage facilities.
         (b)   The subdivider shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement to the town, land on both sides of existing watercourses
of a width to be determined by the Plan Commission and, in the case of legal
drains, by the County Drainage Board.
         (c)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights satisfactory to the
Plan Commission shall have been secured and indicated on the secondary plat.
         (d)   Low-lying land along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be counted in
satisfying the minimum yard or lot area requirement of the Town Zoning
Ordinance.
         (e)   All drainage easements shall be indicated on the secondary plat
and which are to be dedicated to the town shall use the following language:
“All drainage easements shown on this plat are hereby dedicated to the Town of
Plainfield, Indiana”.

§ 3.6D CONNECTION TO TOWN DRAINAGE UTILITIES.
   Whenever practical, all subdivisions within the town shall connect to
drainage utilities provided by the town. In those instances where the Plan
Commission determines that connection to town drainage utilities would pose an
unusual or unnecessary hardship at the time of development, the Plan Commission
may make a recommendation to the Town Council to approve a connection to
another public or semi-public drainage utility, provided, however, that all
drainage facilities are installed to town standards or alternative standards
approved by the Town Engineer, and, provision is made in the design and layout
of the drainage facilities for connection to the town drainage utilities at
such time as the town extends drainage utility facilities to the subdivision.

detention and retention facilities during construction. After construction, the
owner of the real estate shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
detention and retention facilities.
      (2)   Assignment of the responsibility for maintaining a detention or
retention facility which serves more than one lot or land holding shall be
permitted only where:
         (a)   Such assignment of maintenance responsibility for the detention
or retention facilities has been documented by properly executed and recorded
covenants or deed restrictions; or
         (b)   A public body is informed of the desire to have public
maintenance of the detention or retention facilities at the time of filing for
primary plat approval, the final drainage plans are approved by such public
body prior to construction, and the public body formally accepts the
maintenance responsibility for the detention or retention facilities.
