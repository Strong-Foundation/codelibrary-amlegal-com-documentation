previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to

are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.

or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section is severable.
If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the invalidity does
not affect the remainder of the section unless:
      (1)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with and
so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or

authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)

   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of

attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or

§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or
law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is
not revived unless it so expressly provides. The repeal of any section shall
not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under
the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The section
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any
proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or
liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall not be affected

of the town. Such ordinances brought before the administrative body are limited
to those restricting or prohibiting actions harmful to the land, air or water,
safety of persons or those ordinances that govern the use of public way, or the
standing or parking of vehicles, under I.C. 36-1-6-9.
(Prior Code, § 24.04) (Ord. 04-08, passed 11-8-2004)
§ 34.05 REAL PROPERTY; ACTION TO BRING COMPLIANCE; EXPENSES AS LIEN AGAINST
PROPERTY.
   (A)   If a condition violating an ordinance set forth by the town exists on
private real property the officials of the municipal corporation may enter onto
the property and take appropriate action to bring the property into compliance
with an ordinance violated; however, before action to bring the property into
compliance with an ordinance, all persons holding a substantial interest in the
property must be given a reasonable opportunity of at least ten days but not
more than 60 days to bring the property into compliance.
      (1)   If the municipal corporation takes action to bring compliance, the
expenses incurred by the municipal corporation to bring compliance may
constitute a lien against the property.
      (2)   The lien is superior to all other liens except for taxes, in an
amount not to exceed:
         (a)   Two thousand five hundred dollars for real property that:
            1.   Contains one or more occupied or unoccupied single- or double-
family dwellings or the appurtenances or additions to those dwellings; or
            2.   Is unimproved.
         (b)   Ten thousand dollars for all other real property not described
in division (A)(2)(a) above.
   (B)   The town may also issue a bill to the owner of the real property for
the costs incurred by the governing municipal corporation in bringing the
property into compliance with the ordinance, including administrative costs and
removal costs.
   (C)   If the owner of the real property fails to pay a bill issued under
division (A)(2)(a)2. above, the municipal corporation may after 30 days,
certify to the County Auditor the amount of the bill, plus any additional costs
incurred in the certification. The Auditor shall place the total amount
certified on the tax duplicate for the property affected, and the total amount,
including accrued interest, shall be collected as delinquent taxes are
collected and shall be disbursed to the General Fund of the municipal
corporation.
(Prior Code, § 24.05) (Ord. 04-08, passed 11-8-2004)
§ 34.06 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   If a person is charged with violation or code set forth by the Town
Council and wants to exercise his or her right to a trial, the person shall
appear before the Violations Clerk and deny the violation or enter a written
denial with the Clerk.
   (B)   If a person:
      (1)   Denies an ordinance or code violation;
      (2)   Fails to satisfy a civil penalty assessed by the Violations Clerk
after having entered an admission of violation; or
      (3)   Fails to deny or admit the violation.
   (C)   The Clerk shall report this fact to the official of the County Small
Claims Court. Proceedings in the court against the person shall then be
initiated for the alleged ordinance violation.
   (D)   An ordinance violation admitted does not constitute a judgment for the
purposes of state law, and an ordinance violation costs fee may not be
collected from the defendant under state law. In addition, an ordinance
violation processed may not be considered for the purposes of state law when
determining the percentage of ordinance violations prosecuted in certain
courts.

GENERAL POLICIES
§ 35.01 NEPOTISM AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES.
   (A)   The town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a policy of
conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the town and in
contracting with the town in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the laws known as I.C.
36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21.
   (B)   On 11-9-2015, the town shall have a nepotism and a contracting with a
unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2
(herein after “nepotism policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21 (hereinafter “contracting
with a unit by a relative policy”) and implementation will begin.
   (C)   The town nepotism policy is hereby established effective 11-9-2015 by

   (D)   The town contracting with a unit by a relative policy is hereby
established effective 11-9-2015 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions
of I.C. 36-1-21, and including all future supplements and amendments thereto
which become law from time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully
set out herein.
   (E)   The town finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 specifically
allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or detailed” and
that more detailed are necessary.
   (F)   The town further finds that a single member of the legislative body
cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances,
advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a majority
of the body and therefore without such authority by the majority he or she will
not be in the direct line of supervision. See I.C. 36-4-6-11 and I.C. 36-5-2-
9.4.
   (G)   The town finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the town cannot act for the governing body to make work
assignments, compensations, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation
without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute provides that
a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such authority by the
majority the single member will not be in the direct line of supervision.
   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the town are
hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.
   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, compliance
and certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a violation and may
result in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a transfer
from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or
appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of either
the nepotism policy may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with implementation, compliance and
certifications connected with the nepotism policy is a violation and may result
in the discipline, including termination, of an employee or a curative action.
An elected or appointed official of the town who fails to abide by or cooperate
with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications
of either the nepotism policy or the contracting with unit by a relative policy
may be subject to action allowed by law.
   (K)   The policies created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:
      (1)   Posting a copy of this section in its entirety in at least one of
the locations in the town where it posts employer posters or other notices to
its employees;
      (2)   Providing a copy of this section to its employees and elected and
appointed officials:
      (3)   Providing or posting a notice of the adoption of this section; or
      (4)   Any such other action or actions that would communicate the
policies established by this section to its employees and elected and appointed
officials. Upon any of these actions these policies are deemed implemented by
the town.
   (L)   A copy of the provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21 effective
are annexed hereto.
   (M)   Two copies of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, and as supplemented or
amended, are on file in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer for the town for
public inspection as may be required by I.C. 36-1-5-4.

(Prior Code, § 26.01) (Ord. 98-03, passed 6-8-1998; Ord. 2020-3, passed 3-9-
2020; Ord. 2021-3, passed 9-13-2021)
§ 36.02 POLICIES ON EMERGENCIES AND PURSUIT DRIVING.
   (A)   Statement of policy. The town recognizes that violators of the law
will occasionally attempt to elude apprehension or attempt to escape the lawful
application of the law by the officers of the law. In their zeal to elude
capture or sanctions of the law, known or suspected violators of the law have
fled from officers attempting to stop such violators by use of a properly
marked police vehicle making full use of all available emergency equipment.
Such flight is frequently evidenced by use of excessive speed and other erratic
driving behaviors that can expose innocent residents of the town and its
environs to injury or loss of life. The need to bring known or suspected law
violators to justice must always be balanced against the jeopardy to the
citizenry imposed by a police pursuit. The procedures that follow provide the
guidelines to ensure that police pursuits by members of the town’s police force
are undertaken with the greatest degree of due care; however, this policy is
established for the use and guidance of the town’s police force only and does
not apply in criminal or civil proceedings. This policy should not be construed
as creating a higher standard of safety or care in an evidentiary sense with
respect to third party claims than is imposed by law.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      EMERGENCY DRIVING. Driving to a situation that is life threatening or
involves extreme property loss or driving which justifies the legal use of
emergency warning devices. Returning from a scene is not considered EMERGENCY
DRIVING.
      FLEEING. According to I.C. 35-44.1-3-1(a)(3), a person commits resisting
law enforcement if a person knowingly or intentionally flees from a law
enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means,
identified himself or herself and ordered the person to stop. Resisting law
enforcement is normally a Class A misdemeanor, but is a Class D felony if the
person draws or uses a deadly weapon, inflicts bodily injury on another person,
or operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily
injury to another person. The offense is a Class C felony if, while committing
it, the person operates a motor vehicle in a manner that causes serious bodily
injury to another person and a Class B felony if, while committing it, the
person operates a vehicle in a manner that causes the death of another person.
      PURSUIT DRIVING. The act of a sustained chase of a fleeing person in a
motor vehicle in an attempt to apprehend the driver. This includes both closing
the distance between the officer and violator before a visual signal to stop
(red and blue lights) is given. This also includes the period in which the
offender is resisting arrest by knowingly or intentionally failing to yield to
the officer.
   (C)   Pursuit procedures.
      (1)   Authorization of pursuit driving. An officer must be driving an
authorized Town Marshal or town police vehicle which specifically excludes any
personally owned vehicle. The vehicle must be equipped with visual and audible
warning devices. Seat and shoulder belts must be worn at all times the vehicle
is in motion. A pursuit may not be initiated when the vehicle is occupied by
prisoners, suspects, complainants, witnesses or any other person not on duty as
a police officer. This prohibition applies whether or not the passenger has
signed a waiver of liability. Pursuit driving, when permitted by the above, may
be initiated for the apprehension of a known or suspected felon when the
pursuit is initiated within the corporate limits of the town or within one mile
outside the corporate limits; for apprehension of a traffic or misdemeanor
violator, when the infraction or misdemeanor has been committed within the
corporate limits of the town and in the presence of the officer giving pursuit
or in presence of another officer of the town’s police force, or when directed
by the county dispatcher to assist another officer already in pursuit.
      (2)   Pursuit procedures.
         (a)   The officer has the authority when pursuit driving is permitted
to, disregard certain traffic regulations (such as speed limits and the
requirement for a complete stop at signs and signals) in disregarding traffic
regulations, the officer must still drive with due regard for the safety of
others and must not unnecessarily endanger life or property.
         (b)   Unless the suspect is already fleeing from the officer, the
officer should attempt to close the distance between the police vehicle and the
violator before activating the emergency lights and siren to avoid alerting the
offending driver. Once the officer has successfully closed the distance with
the offending driver, the emergency lights and siren should be activated. If
the suspect has already fled from the officer or another law enforcement
officer, the emergency lights and siren should be activated immediately upon
initiating the pursuit.
         (c)   When the pursuit is initiated, the officer should notify the
County Dispatcher of the pursuing status, location, direction of travel, reason
for pursuit and as complete a description of the vehicle and occupants as
possible. The dispatcher should be advised of the status of the pursuit as
frequently as possible. Under police pursuit conditions, the emergency lights
(red and blue) and siren must be operating. All possible precautions must be
taken by police vehicles engaged in such pursuit to insure the safety of the
public and other officers.
         (d)   The maximum speed, if conditions allow, for pursuit driving is
50 mph within the town and 100 mph outside the town limits. The maximum length
of the pursuit of a felony suspect (which does not include a person who is only
a suspected felon and is fleeing from a law enforcement officer in a motor
vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another
person) is five miles (but in no event should the pursuit be continued within
the corporate boundaries of another municipality). Misdemeanor and traffic
violators shall not be pursued more than one mile outside the corporate limits
of the town. An officer who is pursuing a vehicle and is required to disengage
from the pursuit under this division (C)(2)(d) shall notify the dispatcher and
seek assistance from other police agencies in continuing the pursuit.
         (e)   Pursuit driving should be terminated or avoided if the subject
has been identified and can be arrested at a later time. Pursuit driving should
also be terminated when the danger to the public caused by the fleeing vehicle
outweighs the interests of the community in apprehending the violator, i.e.,
consideration should be given to the speed of the suspect through crowded
areas, driving the wrong way on a one-way street or divided highway, or other
ways that the fleeing driver demonstrates a total disregard for his or her
safety and the safety of others.
         (f)   At no time shall more than two police vehicles (including
vehicles from other agencies) be in actual pursuit of another vehicle. The
second police vehicle, if any, shall maintain a safe distance from the initial
pursuit vehicle and will be responsible for keeping the dispatcher advised of
information relating to the pursuit. At no time will additional assisting units
convoy behind the pursued vehicle. Other police units relatively close may move
into the general area of the pursuit using normal emergency limitations, but
such units will not use pursuit driving conditions.
         (g)   An unmarked police vehicle may initiate a pursuit provided the
police vehicle possesses at least a revolving red/blue light and siren. A
pursuit by an unmarked police vehicle shall be discontinued immediately when a
properly marked police vehicle is able to take up the pursuit. Sustained
pursuits by unmarked police vehicles should be undertaken only in situations
involving extreme jeopardy.
         (h)   Upon being notified of a pursuit initiated within the county by
another law enforcement agency in which the assistance of the town’s police
force is requested, all due assistance shall be rendered to the officers of
such other agency. All other policies, and procedures described in this
ordinance shall apply. Specific permission to join the pursuit is not required.
         (i)   Under no circumstances are officers of the town’s police force
authorized to intentionally ram or to intentionally make contact with the
vehicle that is being pursued.
         (j)   The forcible stopping of a fleeing vehicle by members of the
town’s police force may be considered by the use of a roadblock. Roadblocks
shall only be established and maintained regarding a vehicle pursuit in an
attempt to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon (which does not include a
person who is only a suspected felon and is fleeing from a law enforcement
officer in a motor vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of
bodily injury to another person) who presents a clear and present danger to
other citizens. The authority to establish a roadblock shall rest with the Town
Marshal. Roadblocks may only be attempted using town, city or county vehicles
or temporary vehicles. At no time shall the citizens of this community be
ordered to subject either person or property to a roadblock effort. The use of
a “rolling” roadblock to bring the suspect vehicle gradually to a stop is not
permitted. The use of a roadblock shall only be instituted after exhausting all
other efforts to terminate the flight of the fleeing felon.
   (D)   Emergency driving/emergency response procedures.
      (1)   For most responses requiring emergency driving, the maximum speed
if conditions allow outside the town limits is 80 mph; and 50 mph, if
conditions allow, within the town limits. If the call regards an “officer
down,” “assist officer” or “man with gun,” the maximum speed if conditions
allow is 100 mph outside the limits of the town and 55 mph within the town. All
speeds shall be lowered at night, in areas of dense population, during known
farm activity and under adverse weather conditions.
      (2)   During an emergency run, day or night, there must be a continuous
visual warning, i.e., red and blue lights with wig-wag headlights if possible.
Also, day or night, there must be a continuous audible warning signal, i.e.,
siren. The pitch should be changed or horn sounded at intersections when
nearing intersections.
      (3)   All personnel operating the town’s police vehicles shall exercise
due regard for the safety of all persons.
(Prior Code, § 26.02) (Ord. 99-03, passed 6-14-1999)
§ 36.03 POLICIES ON USE OF FORCE.
   (A)   Statement of policy. The need to use force, whether deadly or non-
deadly, is one of the most demanding and critical decisions that a law
enforcement officer must make. There are, however, situations when an officer
must make the irreversible decision of whether or not to use deadly or non-
deadly force. Such a decision can have a powerful and possible harmful effect
on the officer, the department and the community.
      (1)   Recognizing that the town cannot make the decision for its police
officers in advance, it must provide some guidance to aid in the making of that
decision. The procedures that follow provide the guidelines to ensure that the
use of force by members of the town’s police force is undertaken with the
greatest degree of due care; however, this policy is established for the use
and guidance of the town’s police force only and does not apply in criminal or
civil proceedings. This policy should not be construed as creating a higher
standard of safety or care in an evidentiary sense with respect to third party
claims than is imposed by law.
      (2)   The policy of the town is to allow its police officers to use only
that force which is reasonable and necessary to effect an arrest or to protect
themselves or others from personal attack, physical resistance, harm or death.
The decision to exercise force of any level, must be based upon the
circumstances that the officer reasonably believes to exist. The decision to
use force is better predicated upon the danger posed by a subject confronted by
the police than one based upon the general nature or category of an offense.
      (3)   While the use of deadly force is most commonly associated with
firearms, it is not limited to such weapons, but may include other so-called
“non-deadly” protective instruments issued to the town’s police officers, such
as batons and flashlights or any other means (including the use of hands) used
by an officer.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DEADLY FORCE. Defined in I.C. 35-31.5-2-85, and means force that creates
a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.
      FORCIBLE FELONY. Defined in I.C. 35-31.5-2-138 as a felony that involves
the use or threat of force against a human being, or in which there is imminent
danger of bodily injury to a human being.
      NON-DEADLY FORCE. All force used by a police officer other than deadly
force.
      PROTECTIVE INSTRUMENT. Any device authorized for use by the Town Marshals
and utilized by a police officer to apply force to another person.
   (C)   Use of force.
      (1)   Levels of force. The town recognizes four levels of authority,
including three levels of force that may be applied by officers in the official
execution of their duties. These are:
         (a)   Communication/verbal, control/presence. In the daily performance
of his or her job requirements, a police officer’s presence represents
government authority. Situations that officers encounter may require not only
their presence, but frequently some form of verbal or non-verbal communication.
This communication may take the form of providing information, giving commands,
asking or answering questions, physical gestures, conducting interviews or the
like. It may also take the form of issuing specific instructions to individuals
or groups, dealing with arguments, verbal assaults, threats and handling
disputes or disagreements. In the event that the presence, communication or
verbal control is not sufficient to protect, control or arrest, then the
officer may be justified to use reasonable and necessary force from the
appropriate force options set forth below;
         (b)   Physical force. A situation between an officer and an individual
or individuals may escalate to physical force. Physical force between officers
and citizens ranges, from the slightest touching to the infliction of severe
injury or death. Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of serious
bodily injury may be employed only as provided in division (C)(2) below.
Reasonable physical force that does not rise to the level of deadly force may
be used if the officer reasonably believes that the force is necessary to
effect a lawful arrest, to detain a suspect already in custody, to protect
himself or herself or a third person from what the officer reasonably believes
to be the imminent use of unlawful force, or to immediately prevent or
terminate a suspect’s actions. Physical force as contemplated in this division
(C)(1)(b) entails the use of any human body parts such as head, teeth,
shoulders, arms, hands, knees and feet. In the event that physical force is not
sufficient to protect, control or arrest, then the officer is justified in
using reasonable and necessary force from the appropriate higher level options
listed below;
         (c)   Protective instruments. The use of verbal communication or
physical force to control a situation may escalate to the use of a protective
instrument by the officer. The officer may not employ protective instruments
when the use of the same creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury
except in accordance with the procedures set forth in division (C)(2) below;
and
         (d)   Deadly force. Deadly force will be used only in accordance with
the procedures set forth in division (C)(2) below. Deadly force includes the
use of firearms, protective instruments or other force options which creates a
substantial risk of serious bodily injury. While it is intended that officers
use the lowest level of force possible. Options are not predicated on strict
hierarchical sequence, nor must the officer always elect to start at the lowest
level. The officer must evaluate the immediate circumstances and select the
appropriate level of force for those circumstances. While consideration of the
crime committed or attempted may play a role, it should not be the determining
factor. Rather, it is the level of force being used against the officer or
citizen and the immediate potential for death or serious physical injury to the
officer or innocent bystanders or victims upon which officers should base their
decision to use force of any level.
      (2)   Authorized use of deadly force. Officers may use deadly force:
         (a)   If the officer reasonably believes that deadly force is
necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to himself or herself or a third
person;
         (b)   1.   If the officer has probable cause to believe that deadly
force is necessary:
               a.   To prevent the commission of a forcible felony; or
               b.   To effect an arrest of a person who the officer has
probable cause to believe poses a threat of serious bodily injury to the
officer or a third person.
            2.   The officer has given a warning, if feasible, to the person
against whom the deadly force is to be used.
         (c)   To prevent the escape of an arrested person if the officer:
            1.   Has probable cause to believe that deadly force is necessary
to prevent the escape from custody of a person who the officer has probable
cause to believe poses a threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or a
third person; and
            2.   Has given a warning, if feasible, to the person against whom
the deadly force is to be used.
      (3)   Other uses of force.

special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should
be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.
   (F)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the

§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The state legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 and
I.C. 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use
within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the
following floodplain management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      (6)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.
(Prior Code, § 92.01)
§ 154.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A ZONE. Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is
runoff from rainfall, snowmelt or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30,
Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are
presented below.
      (1)   ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
      (3)   ZONE AO.  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
      (5)   ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of
being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
      (6)   ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under
construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood
hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection
system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it complete for insurance
rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood
elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure that is located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay
sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular
program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to
develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. (1) Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a structure or any
addition to a structure;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than
180 days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction
of roads or similar projects;
         (d)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes,
dams, channel improvements and the like;
         (e)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation or drilling
operations;

         (g)   Storage of materials; or
         (h)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of
existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing
roads; or gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading, excavation or the construction of permanent
structures.
   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings or
columns (posts and piers).
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE. A certified statement that verifies a structure’s
elevation information.
   EMERGENCY PROGRAM. The first phase under which a community participates in

that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town
Council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the
property involved. Mere economic or financial HARDSHIP alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP AMENDMENT. A change to an effective NFIP map that results in the
exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described
parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no
alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map
that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).
   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned
by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the
letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised.

or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land
development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdictions of
the town subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the town
are generally identified as such on the county and incorporated areas flood
insurance rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated

The actual START means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage
of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss”
or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements or any
alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a “historic structure.”

the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management
regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that

Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
(NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X ZONES shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or

than 0.2%.
   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity
or type of flooding in the area.
   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.
   ZONE B, C and X.  
      (1)   Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal
hazard from the principal source of flood in the area; however, buildings in
these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with
inadequate local drainage systems.
      (2)   Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is
not required by regulation in these zones. (ZONE X is used on new and revised
maps in place of ZONES B and C.)
(Prior Code, § 92.02)
§ 154.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
SFHAs and known floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This chapter’s
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available
data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace
existing data with better data and submit it to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and approval.
      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for the
studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the town shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the county and
incorporated areas dated February 6, 2013 and the corresponding flood insurance
rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated February
6, 2013.
      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for each
of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of town, delineated as an “A Zone” on the
county and incorporated areas flood insurance rate map prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and dated February 6, 2013, shall be according to
the best data available as provided by the State Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater
than one square mile.
      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known floodprone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the State
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of
special flood hazard.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream
within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions; however, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain
(SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on
the profiles shall govern.
      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood
elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above
the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and
the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be
advised to apply for a LOMA.
   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the town,
the State Department of Natural Resources or the state for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
   (I)   Increased cost of compliance (ICC). In order for buildings to qualify
for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure,” the
National Reform Act of 1994, being 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq. requires that the
building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related
damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the
event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the
flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of
the building at the time of each such flood event.
(Prior Code, § 92.03)

addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, utility meters and other service facilities shall be located at/
above the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components below the FPG. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and
telephone lines, submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the FPG.
      (6)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (7)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (8)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (9)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet
the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter.
      (10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not further extended or replaced.
      (11)   Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume
of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of excavation
taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the
volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of one to one) due to the fill or
structure.
         (a)   The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located.
         (b)   Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to
take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain provided that the
excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the
same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be
accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when
not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled.
         (c)   The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater but
shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater.
         (d)   The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading
to the floodplain.
         (e)   The grading around the excavation shall be such that the
excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater.
         (f)   The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable
enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include
provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or
drainage resulting from its placement.
         (g)   Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be
submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site
work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant
shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator a certified survey of the
excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with
this section.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required.
      (1)   Generally. In addition to the requirements of division (A) above,
all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage
below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor
area greater than 400 square feet;
         (b)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure:
            1.   Where the cost of the addition or improvement equals or
exceeds 50% of the value of the existing structure (excluding the value of the
land); or
            2.   With a previous addition or improvement constructed since the
community’s first floodplain ordinance.
         (c)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the
costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the
land) before damage occurred;
         (d)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;
         (e)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning
the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it
was removed to avoid flood damage; and
         (f)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
      (2)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base
flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of division (B)
(4) below.
      (3)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
division (B)(4) below. Structures located in all A Zones may be floodproofed in
lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures and impacts
from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in §
154.04(C)(2)(k).
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
      (4)   Elevated structures. 
         (a)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated
structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
         (b)   Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls.
         (c)   Designs must meet the following minimum criteria.
            1.   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two
exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area).
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot
above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each
opening, whichever is higher.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
            4.   Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction
in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall,
excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent
device.
            5.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
            6.   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
            7.   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an
elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
            8.   Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest
adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the
conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to
the structure’s originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition
of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.
      (5)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or nonresidential
structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the
following.
         (a)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method.
         (b)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation
of the structure before sloping below the FPG.
         (c)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulk heading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
         (d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
         (e)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or
above the FPG.
      (6)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
         (a)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured
homes to be placed on a site;
            1.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.
         (b)   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all
manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood.
         (c)   Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls as required for elevated structures in division (B)(4) above.
         (d)   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame
or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
         (e)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days; and
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions); or
            3.   Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated
earlier in this section.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA
and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
      (6)   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA
for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to
the extent possible.
   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.
      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in §
154.03(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. If the site is in an
identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant
to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the State Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources is
required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation,
deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and
paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure; however, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to
existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26
allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in
a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in
the floodway from the State Department of Natural Resources. Please note that
if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior
approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the
State Department of Natural Resources.)
      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a
permit (when applicable) has been issued by the State Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the State Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in this section have been
met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the State Department of Natural
Resources; however, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall
take precedence.
      (3)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory
flood more than 0.14 of one foot.
      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including
levees) the town shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in §
154.05 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways/fringes.
      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the State Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/
regulatory assessment citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade has been received from the State Department
of Natural Resources.
         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit
for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be
issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not
less restrictive than the conditions received from the State Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile.
         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of
the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator
shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the
limits of the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation for the site.
         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this
section have been met.
      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood
damages or potential flood damages.
   (H)   Standards for floodprone areas. All development in known floodprone
areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available,
shall meet applicable standards as required per §
154.05.
(Prior Code, § 92.05)
§ 154.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Town Council shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
Board may appeal such decision to the County Circuit Court.
   (C)   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Town
Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (4)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
      (2)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to §
154.05(E) or (G)(1) may be granted.
      (3)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to §
154.05(E) or (G)(1) will require a permit from the State Department of Natural
Resources.
      (4)   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of §
154.05(B), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of
any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation. See division (E) below.
      (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the State Department of Natural Resources upon request. See division (E) below.
   (E)   Variance notification. 
      (1)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it. appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   (F)   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (G)   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in
this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the Town Council may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 92.06)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All
violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of the town code.
   (B)   All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $100 per
day for each separate day of violation.
      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the
violation continues to exist.
      (2)   The Town Council shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
