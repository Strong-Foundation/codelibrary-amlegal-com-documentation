SECTION 3-9: CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND ETHICS86.
   A.   Statement of Purpose 87. Public office is a public trust. The trust of
the public is essential for government to function effectively. Public policy
developed by Officials affect every citizen of the municipality, and it must be
based on honest and fair deliberations and decisions. This process must be free
from threats, favoritism, nepotism, undue influence, and all forms of
impropriety so that the confidence of the public is not eroded. By setting
forth this Statement of Purpose, the Town of Hamden seeks to articulate a
policy that will continually strive to maintain and increase the confidence of
our citizens in the integrity and fairness of their government. Public
Officials and employees must discharge their duties impartially so as to assure
fair competitive access to government procurement by responsible contractors.
In turn, those contractors should conduct themselves in such a manner as to
foster public confidence in the integrity of the competitive process. In all
cases, the reality and appearance of impropriety should be addressed by the
Conflict of Interest Policy and Ethics Ordinance.
   B.   Conflict of Interest Policy and Ethics Ordinance 88. The Town shall
enact, by Ordinance, a code of ethics for all Officials and employees of the
Town, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, and individuals and
entities seeking to and conducting business with the Town. The purpose of such
code is to establish suitable ethical standards by prohibiting acts or actions
incompatible with the discharge of their public duties and the best interests
of the Town, and by directing disclosure of private financial interest or
personal interest 89 in matters affecting the Town by such elected and
appointed Officials or employees as well as such individuals and entities
seeking to and conducting business with the Town. The Ordinance shall designate
an Official to provide all Public Officials and employees of the Town with
copies of the provisions of §
3-9 of this Charter and the implementing Ordinances and policies enacted
hereunder, upon the commencement of their public service and/or employment.
      (1)    The Council shall enact a code of ethics by Ordinance (and
amendments thereto) following public review and comment by the Board of Ethics,
in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Charter90.
      (2)   Recusal 91. The Official or employee filing a disclosure under this
Charter or Ordinance with the Town Clerk shall refrain from voting,
participating or acting on matters which are the subject of such disclosures.
      (3)   Violation. In addition to any remedies or penalties set forth in
the Ordinance effectuating this provision of the Charter, any finding of a
violation by the Board of Ethics, as set forth in §
7-2.C(5) of this Charter:
         (a)   shall render any action, including but not limited to any
contract or agreement involved voidable at the option of the Town92;
         (b)   may result in the discipline of Officials and employees in
accordance with the provisions of this Charter and Ordinances93; and,
          (c)   may result in disqualifying individuals or entities from
engaging in business with the Town for a period of time to be established by
Ordinance94.
   C.   Conflict of Interest and Corrupt Practices 95. No Official shall
violate the provisions of the General Statutes 96, this Charter or Ordinances
pertaining to conflicts of interest and corrupt practices 97. The Ordinance
required by §
3-9.B of this Charter shall define and set forth the parameters of conflicts of

CHAPTER VII: BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS
SECTION 7-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS234.
   A.   Creation of Boards and Commissions 235. In addition to those Boards and
Commissions established by this Charter, the Legislative Council shall by
Ordinance establish the Boards and Commissions of the Town. Unless this Charter
or Special Acts provides otherwise, the Legislative Council shall set forth, by
Ordinance:
      (1)   The Role of Boards and Commissions. The primary purpose of a Board
or Commission is to serve the residents of the Town in carrying out the policy,
advisory and/or quasi-judicial or regulatory functions under its charge. Boards
and Commissions serve as a conduit for citizen participation and input by
gathering, analyzing and acting upon such information in order to meet the
specific objectives as set forth under this Charter, Ordinances or other source
of legal authority.
      (2)   The Public Interest. Members of Boards and Commissions are required
to understand the role and scope of responsibility and be informed of the
objectives, scope of responsibility and operating procedures of the Board of
Commission to which they are appointed. Members should represent the public
interest and not personal interests or special interest groups and seek to
render decisions on the basis of what is best for the residents of the Town.
Furthermore, members should take care that deliberations include thorough
research and review of all alternatives on an issue prior to making a
recommendation.
         (a)   Regulatory Functions 236. In the case of members of regulatory
Boards and Commissions, decisions should be evidence-based taking into account
the interests of the public and fairness to the parties based upon application
of the Law and any other pertinent documents.
         (b)   Departmental Policy and Administrative Functions 237. In the
case of members of Boards and Commissions aligned with a Department, members
serve as a communication link between the community, staff, and Town presenting
programs and recommendations and provide a channel for citizen expression.
Members should establish a strong working relationship with Department Heads
and other executives; however, at all times, members represent the public
interest as opposed to the specific department interests under their
jurisdiction. This is particularly true when a Board or Commission has an
oversight function.
      (3)   Open Meetings 238. The objective of Hamden's open government policy
is to achieve optimal public accessibility at all Meetings and to lead the way
as the State policy and law evolve. All Meetings of Boards and Commissions
shall be public and conducted in strict compliance with the requirements of the
General Statutes; unless otherwise permitted or required by Law 239. In
furtherance of this objective, all Boards and Commissions shall utilize all
technology provided by the Town so that in person, remote 240 or hybrid
interactions 241 may be provided at every meeting. The Town shall migrate
toward ensuring that technology is available to all Boards and Commissions so
that all possible means of public participation are provided for at every
meeting.
      Transition Migration Plan: The Mayor and Legislative Council shall agree
to a transition plan to comply with the provisions of § 7-1.A(2) of this
Charter. The plan shall include initial implementation staging for system and
operational requirements, funding for which shall be set forth in the Adopted
Town Budget for FY 2023-2024 (General fund/Operating and Capital).
   B.   Administrative Requirements of Boards and Commissions 242. All Boards
and Commissions established by this Charter or by Ordinance are required to
comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   Number of Members and Terms 243. The number of Board and Commission
members (and alternates) and terms of office, which may be staggered. Except as
otherwise provided by the General Statutes and this Charter, the number shall
always be odd and the term of office shall not exceed a term of six (6) years,
which may be staggered.
         (a)   Modification of Charter Provisions Requiring Legislative Council
District Representation 244. Where the Charter creates a Board or Commission to
be appointed from each of the legislative districts of the Town, the Council
shall, by Ordinance, expand or contract the number of members in order to
accommodate any changes in the number of legislative districts.
         (b)   Representation by Legislative Council District 245. In
furtherance of the objective to ensure fair and diverse representation the
Legislative Council may, by Ordinance, modify the composition of any Board and
Commission established under this Charter or by Ordinance in order to implement
representation by Legislative Council District.
      (2)   Required Ordinance Provisions 246. Any such Ordinance shall make
provision for:
         (a)   The appointment of a chair, such officers as may be necessary
for its proper function and a delineation of the responsibilities of the
presiding officer and other officers;
         (b)   The keeping of records and posting of agendas as required by the
General Statutes;
         (c)   Compliance with minority party representation in accordance with
§7-1.B(8) of this Charter;
         (d)   Public access, comment and interaction (including, but not
limited to, public speaking, comment and any applicable rules and protocols),
in accordance with the requirements of §7-1.B(7) of this Charter;
         (e)   Frequency of regular Meetings of all Boards and Commissions, in
compliance with §7-1.B(4) of this Charter, and mandatory attendance
requirements, for the purpose of establishing a standard as required by §7-1E
(2) of this Charter. The agendas of Boards and Commissions shall be approved by
the Chair of such entity; and,
         (f)   Department Head, where aligned with a Board or Commission,
responsibility to notify members and any complaining parties of civilian
complaints pertaining to matters within the jurisdiction of said Board or
Commission, in accordance with rules established by said Board or Commission.
      (3)   Quorum. A majority of the total membership of each such Board and
Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business;
unless, otherwise required by the General Statutes.
      (4)   Meeting Frequency and Notice 247. Each Board or Commission shall
meet as frequently as necessary to perform its duties; however, not less than
monthly. Meetings may be cancelled with notice and disclosure to the public
stating the reason for such cancellation; notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Board or Commission shall cancel Meetings for two (2) consecutive months.
Failure to obtain a quorum shall not be deemed a violation of this provision of
the Charter 248. The Chair, any two (2) members or the Mayor may call a Meeting
of any appointive Board or Commission, provided each member is given notice of
not less than twenty-four (24) hours thereof, unless otherwise required by Law
(See, §
1-4(R)).
      (5)   Clerk 249. The Town Clerk, working with the Mayor, shall make
certain that each Board or Commission has a clerk or other designee assigned to
serve the function of said entity.
      (6)   Public Records 250. Each clerk shall keep a complete record of the
resolutions and other proceedings of the Board or Commission and shall have
custody of its correspondence, files and other records. All minutes and
recordings of Meetings shall be filed with the Town Clerk. All such records
shall be open for public inspection at reasonable hours and shall be available
for public review and inspection on the Town website in compliance with the
requirements of Law. Departments Heads shall obtain the approval of a Board or
Commission aligned with their department, prior to transmitting a request to
the Mayor for the disposition, transfer or destruction of public documents in
accordance with Law.
      (7)   Public Access, Comment and Interaction 251.
         (a)   Remote and Direct Public Access to Boards and Commissions. Each
Board and Commission shall have capacity to receive remote, direct electronic
or digital communications from the public. Said means of communication shall
include those currently in existence or those to be created in the future and
shall uniformly apply to all Boards and Commissions at any given time. Access
to the such communications capacity shall be limited to the clerk and/or Chair
of the Board or Commission both of whom shall be responsible for disseminating
such information to the remaining members. The Town Clerk will work with the
Town officials responsible for electronic or digital communications in order to
facilitate assignment of such communications technologies to Boards and
Commissions.
         (b)   Public Comment: Prior to and During Meetings. Meetings of Boards
and Commissions shall be open to the public in accordance with the General
Statutes. There shall be a public comment session prior to the commencement of
all business on the regular and special Meeting agenda of a Board or
Commission. Each Board or Commission shall establish rules pertaining to the
time and duration of such public comment and the protocols for additional
public comment during any Meeting in the event said Board or Commission has
received or heard new, material information during the course of a Meeting
following the initial public comment session. Such additional public comment,
if any, shall be considered prior to Final Action on the related agenda item,
at the discretion of the Chair of said Board or Commission.
            (i)   Agenda Items and Matters within Purview of the Board or
Commission. The public may address any item on the agenda of a regular or
special Meeting and any matter within the purview of a Board or Commission at a
regular Meeting, electronically or in person. unless otherwise set forth or

simple majority of the members present and voting if motion is made on the day
of the regular Meeting, insofar as such modifications are in accordance with
Law. Following the addition of an item to the agenda the Board or Commission is
required to permit public comment on such added items.
            (iii)   Submission Requirements. The rules of each Board and
Commission shall establish a submission requirement for documents to be
considered at the subsequent Meetings of such body. For the purposes of §7-1.B
(7)(b)(ii), above, documents shall be provided to the public online as soon as
available to the members of the Board or Commission.
            (iv)   Executive Session and Other Legal or Regulatory Proceedings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, public comment may be limited or prohibited on
agenda items covered by the Law pertaining to non-public Meetings 252 or
executive sessions 253, by applicable provisions of collective bargaining
agreement, if any; and any Laws or agreements protective of the privacy rights,
confidentiality or legal rights associated with any party before the Board or
Commission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boards and Commissions should strive
to permit public comment where possible in order to reach a balance between the
public interest, contractual and legal obligations and avoiding prejudicial
behavior in the decisions to be rendered; as may be determined by opinion of

Boards and Commissions, including vacancies, is set forth in this section of
the Charter and is absolute unless otherwise set forth in the General Statutes

status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, familial and marital
status, pregnancy, or physical and mental disability and cultural make-up of
the Town in order to achieve a representative balance of its residents.
      (2)   Geographical Areas of the Town. Moreover, Hamden is committed to
ensuring fair representation of residents from all voting districts on Boards
and Commissions, including balanced representation from throughout the Town. In
order to advance the intent of this provision, the Mayor or any other
appointing authority shall make best efforts to avoid the appointment of more
than one member from the same Legislative Council District; however, under no
circumstance shall appoint more than two. While this Charter may specifically
populate some Boards and Commissions on the basis of the Legislative Council
Districts, this provision applies, subject to the exceptions specifically set
forth herein, to Boards and Commissions. The Legislative Council may create or
modify the composition of any Board or Commission as set forth in §7-1.B(1)(b)
of this Charter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this limitation shall not apply
to any Board or Commission charged with a mission focused on a specific
geographic area of the Town.
      (3)   Backgrounds. Of equal weight with the foregoing requirements, the
Mayor and other appointing authorities are obligated to take into consideration
a diversity of backgrounds, life experience, expertise, as well as personal
integrity and a commitment to ensuring an ethical and transparent local
government. The Mayor and Legislative Council, when examining new candidates
for appointment to Boards and Commissions are required to give due
consideration to recommendations made by representatives of Outreach
Organizations as set forth in §7-1.K (2) of this Charter and other similar

Commission as set forth in §
7-2.L of this Charter.
   H.   Dual Appointment Prohibited; Exceptions 270. Except where otherwise
provided by general or special law, no person may serve as an appointed member
of more than one Board or Commission at the same time, with the exception of a
Charter Revision Commission, other Boards or Commissions of finite duration or
appointment as a representative of the Town on regional entities 271. Members
of the Legislative Council may only serve on a Board or Commission if assigned
as a representative to such Board or Commission for the sole purpose of
representing the Council.
   I.   Restrictions Pertaining to Members of the Civil Service Commission,
Finance Commission 272, Board of Ethics and Police Commission and Fire
Commission 273. No person who has served in the previous two (2) years in
municipal office in the Town of Hamden (other than a member of the Boards or
Commissions set forth in this sub-section) or a political party officer, shall

Board of Ethics, Police Commission or Fire Commission. For purposes of this
section, the term "Municipal Office" means an individual who holds or has held

of the peace or notary public) in the Town and the term "political party
officer" means an officer of a national committee of a political party, state
central or town committee or any person employed by such committee for
compensation.
   J.   Required Cooperation 274. Each Official 275 and employee of any
Department 276 of the Town shall assist the Boards and Commissions and the
pertinent Departments in carrying out the provisions of this section.

not the source of legal authority for the creation of the Hamden Police

authority under the home rule act; in particular, C.G.S. §7-193(b).

347   NEW (2022). Comment of the 2022 Charter Revision Commission. It is
generally understood that Chapter 104 of Title 7 of the General Statutes, which
includes C.G.S. §7-274 through §7-280, addresses the creation of police
commissions, by ordinance, in municipalities which do not have Home Rule
Charters. This general notion is complicated by the placement of other
provisions of apparent general application which are included in Chapter 104. A
study of Title 7 has been authorized by the General Assembly to clarify issues
of the relationship between laws that address charter and non-charter
municipalities. Any conclusions that these provisions would be applicable to
charter municipalities would require further due diligence including possible
guidance from the courts.

hearing or not. After an appeal has been accepted by the board, the chairman
then shall appoint at least three board members to a panel to hear the case.
Following the result of the hearing the Board informs the building official and
the owner of their findings. If the owner is still not pleased with the ruling
of the board they have the option to appeal to the Codes and Standards
Committee within 14 days of the ruling. The overall goal of the board is to
ensure that the public has a forum to express concerns if they feel they are
being treated unfairly in the building process. The Commission works to make
sure both sides are heard to thus ensuring a decision that both sides can work
with in the future. This board consists of five members, with no more than
three of the same political party. This is a five-year appointment, which is
recommended by the Mayor and subject to the approval of the Legislative
Council. Meetings are scheduled as needed.

12.03   Miscellaneous provisions
§ 12.01 APPOINTMENT OF HEARING OFFICER.
   The Mayor shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers, other than
police officers or employees or persons who issue citations, to conduct the
hearings authorized by this section.
(Ord. 512, passed 3-7-05)
§ 12.02 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Any time within 12 months from the expiration of the final period for
the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any citation
issued under any ordinance adopted pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., §§ 7-148 or
22a-226d, for an alleged violation thereof, shall send notice to the person
cited. Such notice shall inform the person cited:
      (1)   Of the allegations against him or her and the amount of the fines,
penalties, costs or fees due;
      (2)   That he or she may contest his or her liability before a citation
hearing officer by delivering in person or by mail written notice within ten
days of the date thereof;
      (3)   That if he or she does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and
judgment shall be entered against him or her; and
      (4)   That such judgment may issue without further notice.
   (B)   If the person who is sent notice pursuant to division (A) of this
section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he or she may,
without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties,
costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by
such municipality. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil
or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the
payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing
within ten days of the date of the first notice provided for in division (A) of
this section shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated
municipal official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the
hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the
fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances and
shall follow the procedures set forth in division (D) of this section.
   (C)   Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the
date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than
15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided
the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by
any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified
copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the issuing official or
policeman shall be filed and retained by the municipality, and shall be deemed
to be a business record within the scope of Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-180 and
evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the issuing official
or policeman shall be required at the hearing if such person so requests. A
person wishing to contest his or her liability shall appear at the hearing and
may present evidence in his or her behalf. A designated municipal official,
other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the
municipality. If such person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an
assessment by default against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and
liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The hearing officer may
accept from such person copies of police reports, investigatory and citation
reports, and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that
the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct
the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he or she
deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence
shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or
affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end
of the hearing. If he or she determines that the person is not liable, he or
she shall dismiss the matter and enter his or her determination in writing
accordingly. If he or she determines that the person is liable for the
violation, he or she shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties,
costs or fees against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances of
the municipality.
   (D)   If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing
officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person
found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months
after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk
of a superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator
together with an entry fee of $8. The certified copy of the notice of
assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such 12-month
period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one
record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such
record of assessment and court costs of $8, against such person in favor of the
municipality. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the
hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the
effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may
issue without further notice to such person.
   (E)   A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this
section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be
instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing
a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal
to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-
259, at a Superior Court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator,
which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of
the judges of the Superior Court.

(Ord. 435, passed 3-12-01; Am. Ord. 666, passed 12-7-15)
§ 31.33 CREDITED SERVICE; BREAK IN SERVICE.
   (A)   Credited service.
      (1)   A member shall receive credited service for each year and completed
months of service (a fraction of a month in excess of 15 days shall count as a
full month) from the date he/she became an eligible employee to his/her date of
termination, death or retirement, provided that such employment was continuous.
Employment is continuous if service is not interrupted by a termination of
employment or a non-paid approved leave of absence in excess of 90 days. Except
as provided in division (E) of this §
31.33, in no event may a member receive credited service for any period longer
than 90 days during which he/she was required to make member contributions and
failed to do so.
      (2)   The accrual of credited service shall be limited to a maximum of 35
years for members who were first employed by the town on or after July 1, 1978.
For members hired before July 1, 1978, the maximum retirement pension may
exceed 35 years of credited service, provided however, that the member retires
prior to June 30, 2008. A member with more than 35 years of credited service as
of June 30, 2008 who continues to work shall not accrue additional years of
credited service on and after such date.
      (3)   The credited service of a member who has been employed by the town
as both a service employee and a guardian employee shall be considered separate
and distinct periods of credited service for benefit accrual purposes, but
shall be combined for vesting purposes.
      (4)   Guardian employees first employed after January 1, 1989 shall be
credited with past service employee service, if applicable, but shall receive
guardian employee credited service equal to one year of guardian employee
credited service for each two years of service employee credited service,
prorated proportionately as appropriate.
   (B)   Military service purchase prior to employment with the town.
      (1)   A member shall be allowed to purchase credited service for active
military duty prior to employment with the town. A member may purchase a
minimum of six months, up to a maximum of four years. A member must provide
documentation of military service in the form of a D.D.214, and must have been
honorably discharged.
      (2)   The cost to purchase such military service shall be calculated as
follows:
         (a)   For members hired prior to April 1, 1992, the cost to purchase
military service shall be equal to 5% of the compensation of the member on the
effective date of employment, multiplied by the number of years and/or months
in active military duty as specified on the member's D.D.214, plus 5% interest
compounded annually from initial date of employment through March 31, 1992.
         (b)   For members hired on or after April 1, 1992, the cost to
purchase military service shall be equal to 5% of the compensation of the
member on the effective date of employment, multiplied by the number of years
and/or months in active military duty as specified on the member's D.D.214,
plus 5% interest compounded annually from initial date of employment through
the date the member elects to purchase such service and begins repayment.
      (3)   Any new employee shall have a period of 36 months from the date of
hire to buy back said military time, and can pay by voluntary payroll deduction
on a post-tax basis, in an approved equal payment plan, or other arrangement
agreed to by the Retirement Board.
   (C)   Non-work periods credited. Except as provided in this division (C), a
member shall not receive credited service for periods of absence from
employment with the town in excess of 90 days.
      (1)   Military service. The plan shall grant credited service and years
of vesting service in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-
employment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) for a member who was an eligible
employee immediately prior to the commencement of military service as defined
in USERRA, provided such member returns to employment with the town within the
required period of time set forth in divisions (2)(a)l. through 4., below.
Credited service shall only be granted if the member fulfills the requirements
of division (C)(3). Effective January 1, 2007, if a member dies while
performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the
Internal Revenue Code), the member's beneficiaries are entitled to any
additional benefits (other than benefit accruals related to the period of
qualified military service) provided under the plan had the member resumed and
then terminated employment with the town on account of death. Effective for
plan years commencing after December 31, 2008, "compensation" for purposes of
determining benefits and/or member contributions shall include "differential
wage payments" as that term is defined in Section 414(u)(12) of the Internal
Revenue Code that a member receives from the town while on active duty and
performing services for the U.S. uniformed services.
      (2)   (a)   Under USERRA, the required period depends on the length of
military service. In general, the required period is:
            1.   One day after a member's military service ends (if such
service was less than 31 days);
            2.   Fourteen days after a member's military service ends (if such
service was more than 30, but less than 181 days); and
            3.   Ninety days after a member's military service ends (if such
service was more than 180 days).
            4.   If a member is hospitalized for or recovering from an illness
or injury which was incurred or aggravated during military service, USERRA
requires that such member register for re-employment with the town as soon as
he/she has recovered. Except as otherwise provided by USERRA, this recovery
period cannot exceed two years.
         (b)   A member who enters the Armed Forces of the United States for a
period of not more than five years (consecutive or individual years), is
separated from active duty under conditions other than a dishonorable
discharge, and returns to or is available for work within the period specified
in division (2)(a)l. through 4. above shall be granted not to exceed one year
of credited service or years of vesting service in any one calendar year, up to
a maximum of five years of credited service or years of vesting service, for
such active duty in the Armed Forces.
      (3)   A member returning from military service who meets the requirements
of division (C)(1) and (2) shall have the right to make up his/her member
contributions and thereby receive credited service equal to his/her period of
military service, to a maximum of five years of credited service. Such member
must notify the Retirement Board upon re-employment of his/her desire to repay
his/her member contributions. Such contributions shall be made either in a lump
sum payment or on a pre-tax basis over a period equal to the lesser of three
times his/her military service or five years. The amount of member
contributions owed to the plan shall be equal to a percentage of the member's
earnings (determined in accordance with the member's contribution rate in
effect at the time the member entered military service) for the preceding 12-
month period prior to his/her military service, multiplied by the number of
years and months of military service, to a maximum of five years; plus
compounded interest at the rate of 5% annually.
      (4)   To the extent required by USERRA, a member must inform the town in
writing before entering military service in order to be eligible for years of
vesting service as described above.
   (D)   Break in service.
      (1)   If a member has a break in service before attaining vested status,
it has the effect of canceling the member's standing under this plan; that is,
the forfeiture of his/her participation, his/her previously accrued years of
vesting service and years of credited service. However, a break in service may
be temporary, subject to repair by a return to employment with the town.
      (2)   A break in service is repairable, in the sense that its effects are
eliminated if, before incurring a permanent break in service, the member
subsequently returns to employment with the town. Previously earned vesting
service and credited service shall be restored, provided previously refunded
contributions are returned in accordance with division (D)(4). However, nothing
in this division (D)(2) shall change the effect of a permanent break in
service.
      (3)   Permanent break in service. A break in service for a period longer
than the member's years of credited service will result in a permanent break in
service and the cancellation of credited service and vesting service. A break
in service will be considered a permanent break in service and all previously
accrued years of vesting service and years of credited service will be canceled
if the member does not return to employment with the town as of the last day of
the plan year in which the number of one-year breaks in service equals or
exceeds the number of previously earned credited service or years of vesting
service, whichever is greater.
      (4)   Effect of a permanent break in service. If a member who has not
achieved vested status has a permanent break in service:
         (a)   Previous years of credited service and vesting service are
canceled; and
         (b)   Participation is canceled and new participation is subject to
the provisions of §
31.32(A).
      (5)   A member who returns to employment with the town before incurring a
permanent break in service may have previous credited service and vesting
service restored upon returning his/her accumulated contributions plus interest
within 60 days of his/her re-employment, in accordance with the provisions of §
31.34(E). If such member fails to return his/her accumulated contributions, the
member shall be considered a new member for all purposes of the plan and
forfeit previously earned credited service and vesting service with the town.
      (6)   In no event shall a member who is inducted into the armed services
of the United States incur a break in service if the member returns to
employment with the town in accordance with the provisions of division (C)(2)
of this section.
      (7)   In no event shall a member who is on an approved leave of absence
incur a break in service, unless such member does not return to employment on
the date specified by the Retirement Board.
      (8)   If a member is laid off and is called back to active service within
two years, no permanent break in service shall occur, subject to the return of
contributions in accordance with division (D)(4) of this section.
   (E)   Service as town clerk. Subject to the conditions hereafter set forth,
the plan shall grant credited service and years of vesting service for service
as town clerk for a member who was an eligible employee immediately prior to
the commencement of service as town clerk. Such grant of credited service and
years of vesting service for any active continuous service as town clerk shall
be conditioned upon the member informing the town in writing within 60 days of
becoming town clerk (or within 60 days of the effective date of this amendment,
if later) of his/her desire to receive credited service and vesting service
credit during his/her service as town clerk and his/her election to make
contributions on a regular periodic basis during the term of his/her service as
town clerk calculated upon such member's compensation during his/her service as
town clerk. If, when such election is made, there are periods of service as
town clerk for which contributions were not made because the election was not
available for such earlier period(s), then the contributions attributable to
such prior period of time, together with accumulated interest at the rate of 5%
per annum, shall be made in a lump sum payment at the time of the election or
over a period of the lesser of (i) three years or (ii) the period of such
service during which contributions were not made.

same source of funds used for the payment of salaries to employees. A deduction
shall be made from each member's compensation equal to the amount of the member

      (3)   Member contributions picked-up by the town shall be credited to a

retirement date (the date he/she would have been entitled to submit an
application for benefits for approval by the Retirement Board for a regular
pension under division (A) if he/she had remained in employment with the town

   (D)   Service related disability pension.
      (1)   Any guardian employee member who is found by the Retirement Board

otherwise provided in division (A)(5) of this section, be equal to the
following:
         (a)   One-twelfth (1/12) of 2.5% of a service employee member's
average annual compensation multiplied by the service employee member's years
of credited service to a maximum of 20 years; plus
         (b)   One-twelfth (1/12) of 2% of a service employee member's average
annual compensation multiplied by the service employee member's years of
credited service in excess of 20, to a maximum of 35 years.
         (c)   A service employee member's retirement pension shall not exceed
80% of his/her average annual compensation, subject to the provisions of
division (A)(2).
      (2)   The maximum retirement pension for service employee members hired
on or after July 1, 1978 shall be limited to 35 years of credited service. For
service employee members hired before July 1, 1978, the maximum retirement
pension payable may exceed 35 years of credited service, provided that a
service employee member with more than 35 years of credited service as of June
30, 2008, who continues to work shall have his/her benefit frozen as of June
30, 2008, based on the service employee member's average annual compensation on
such date. In no event shall it exceed 85% of average annual compensation.
      (3)   The monthly regular pension for a service employee member who
terminated service or retired prior to July 1, 1999 shall be equal to the
following, unless the provisions of the plan in effect when the service
employee member terminated set forth a different pension benefit:
         (a)   One-twelfth (1/12) of 2% of a service employee member's average
annual compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service, up
to a maximum of 25 years; plus
         (b)   An additional one-twelfth (1/12) of 3% of a service employee
member's average annual compensation multiplied by the number of years of
credited service rendered in excess of 25.
      (4)   For service employee members who terminated employment prior to
July 1, 1995, the amount of the service employee member's regular pension
calculated in accordance with division (A)(3) of this section shall be offset
by a percentage of the service employee member's social security determined as
follows:
         (a)   A service employee member's regular pension shall be offset by
the lesser of the set social security offset percent in division (A)(4)(b) or
the formulated social security offset in division (A)(4)(c), based upon the
service employee member's primary amount of social security at age 65 under the
Federal Social Security Act; such amount to be determined based on the level of
compensation received by the service employee member at the date of termination
of employment with the town.
         (b)   The "set social security offset percent" is as follows for each
of the plan years:
Retirement Date On or After      Social SecurityOffset
   January 1, 1986         58%
   January 1, 1987         56%
   January 1, 1988         54%

   January 1, 1990         50%
   January 1, 1991         48%
   January 1, 1992         40%
   January 1, 1993         30%
   January 1, 1994         20%
   January 1, 1995         10%
   July 1, 1995            0%
         (c)   The "formulated social security offset percent" is calculated as
follows: divide the service employee member's number of years of credited
service with the town by 30 and multiply by 60%.
         (d)   Any service employee member who retired between July 1, 1991,
and February 1, 1992, had their social security offset reduced to 30%, provided
that they applied for a retirement and completed the appropriate application
forms between July 1, 1991 and February 1, 1992.
      (5)   In the event a service employee member has service as both a
service employee and a guardian employee, his/her regular pension attributable
to his/her service as a guardian employee shall be calculated separately, in
accordance with the provisions of §
31.38 and based upon his/her compensation and years of credited service accrued
while as a guardian employee.
   (B)   Minimum retirement benefit.
      (1)   For service employee members who terminate employment on or after
July 1, 1985, the monthly regular pension benefit under division (A) of this
section shall not be less than sixty hundredths (60/100) of 1% of the service
employee member's average annual compensation, divided by 12, for each year of
credited service, or $3.25, whichever is greater.
      (2)   For service employee members who terminated with a vested benefit
before July 1, 1985, their minimum benefit shall be calculated using the
applicable provisions of the plan in effect prior to July 1, 2000.
   (C)   Amount of disability pension.
      (1)   A service employee member retiring on a service related or non-
service related disability pension as defined in §
31.35(D) shall receive a monthly benefit equal to the greater of:
         (a)   50% of the service employee member's average annual
compensation; or
         (b)   The service employee member's monthly regular pension calculated
in accordance with division (A) of this section as of his/her date of
disability.
      (2)   A service employee member who is eligible for a regular pension
pursuant to §
31.35(A) shall have a non-service related disability pension calculated as if
the service employee member was retiring on a regular pension.
   (D)   Amount of early retirement pension benefit. The amount of the early
retirement pension benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the
monthly regular pension in division (A) of this section, but shall be reduced
to take into account such early retirement as follows:
      (1)   From age 60 to age 65, 0.6% for each month early retirement
precedes age 65; and
      (2)   From age 55 to age 60, 0.3% for each month early retirement
precedes age 60.
   (E)   Vested pension.
      (1)   A service employee member shall be entitled to a vested pension
after completion of at least ten years of credited service or ten years of
vesting service. The amount of the vested pension shall be calculated in the
same manner as a regular pension, in accordance with the provisions of the plan
and benefit formula in effect on the date the service employee member
terminated employment.
      (2)   The vested pension benefits provided by this division (E) shall be
in lieu of all other benefits provided by the plan for such service employee
member, his/her spouse and his/her dependent children, except for the return of
the service employee member's accumulated contributions.
   (F)   Maximum benefit limitation.
      (1)   (a)   Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary,
for plan years beginning on or after June 30, 2002 and prior to July 1, 2007
the annual benefit of a service employee member hereunder (adjusted to an
actuarially equivalent straight life annuity based upon the interest rate as
determined by the PBGC on January 1 each year) shall not at any time within the
limitation year exceed the lesser of $140,000 (the "dollar limitation") or 100%
of the member's average compensation for his/her high three years.
         (b)   For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2007 in no event
shall the maximum annual retirement benefit attributable to town contributions
and payable to a service employee member who has not yet retired under the term
of the plan, exceed $160,000 (the defined benefit dollar limitation).
      (2)   The annual retirement benefit payable to a service employee member
under the plan shall be deemed not to exceed the applicable maximum limitation
of division (F)(l) if:
         (a)   The annual retirement benefit payable with respect to such
service employee member under the plan and under all defined benefit plans of
the town does not exceed $10,000 for the limitation year, or for any prior
limitation year; and
         (b)   The town has not at any time maintained a defined contribution
plan in which the service employee member participated.
      (3)   In the event that a service employee member has been a member in
the plan less than ten years, the dollar limitation and the defined benefit
dollar limitation, as applicable, shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is his years of participation in the plan (or part thereof)
and the denominator of which is ten. In the event that a member has less than
ten years of vesting service, the $10,000 benefit above, shall be reduced by
multiplication by a fraction, the numerator of which is his years of service
(or part thereof) and the denominator of which is ten.
   (G)   Maximum benefit limitation definitions. For purposes of divisions (F)
through (K) of this section:
      (1)   The term "ANNUAL BENEFIT" shall mean the benefit the service
employee member would be entitled to at his/her or her normal retirement date,
assuming he or she continues employment until such date, and that all other
relevant facts used to determine benefits under the plan remain constant as of
the current limitation year for all future limitation years.
      (2)   "ANNUAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT" means a benefit payable annually in the
form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to
which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as
defined in Sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code) are made. A benefit payable in any other form shall be converted to the
actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity for purposes of applying these
limits based on a 5% interest assumption. Other required adjustments are
provided for in this division. In the event that a service employee member's
annual retirement benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity, or if the members contribute to the plan or make rollover
contributions (as defined in Sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code), the determinations as to whether the limitation
described in division (F)(1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance
with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adjusting such benefit so
that it is the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity (with no
ancillary benefits). For purposes of this division (G)(2), any ancillary
benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not
be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which
constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in Section 417
of the Internal Revenue Code) shall not be taken into account. For purposes of
adjusting any benefit, the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the
greater of 5% or the rate specified for an actuarial equivalent benefit.
      (3)   "COMPENSATION" for purposes of the maximum benefit limitations
under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall mean any and all earnings
reported on W-2 forms completed by the town in respect to the plan year
specified. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for plan years
commencing after December 31, 1997, "Compensation" for this section shall
include (1) any elective deferral (as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code), (2) any amount which is contributed or deferred by the
town at the election of the member and which is not includable in the gross
income of the member by reason of Sections 125 (cafeteria plan) or 457 (non-
qualified deferred compensation plan) of the Internal Revenue Code. For plan
years commencing on and after January 1, 2001, "Compensation" shall also
include elective amounts that are not includable in the gross income of the
participant by reason of Section 132(f)(4) (qualified transportation fringes)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective for plan years commencing on or after
July 1, 2007, "Compensation" under this section for any plan year shall not be
greater than the limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code
that applies for that year.
      (4)   "LIMITATION YEAR" shall mean a plan year.
   (H)   Adjustment for early or late commencement of benefits.
      (1)   (a)   For plan years commencing prior to July 1, 2007, if the
annual pension benefit of a member begins before age 62, as described in
Section 415(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, the $140,000 limitation set
forth in division (F)(1)(a) of this section shall be reduced so that it is
equivalent to such a benefit beginning at the Social Security retirement age as
described in Section 415(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code. The reduction of
this division shall not reduce the limitation of division (F)(1) of this
section below $75,000 if the benefit begins at or after age 55, or, if the
benefit begins before age 55, the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age
55.
         (b)   Effective for plan years commencing after June 30, 2007, if the
annual benefit of a service employee member begins prior to age 62, the defined
benefit dollar limitation applicable to the service employee member at such
earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity
beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined
benefit dollar limitation applicable to the service employee member at age 62
(adjusted under division (H)(3) below, if required). The defined benefit dollar
limitation applicable at an age prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of
(i) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar
limitation computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable
mortality table and expressing the service employee member age based on
completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date; or (ii) the product
of the defined benefit dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual
amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at
the service employee member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the
immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both
determined without applying the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (2)   In the event that a service employee member's annual benefit
commences after age 65, the dollar limitation or defined benefit dollar
limitation, as applicable, shall be increased for the service employee member's
age such that it is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar
limitation (adjusted under division (H)(3) below, if required) commencing at
age 65. For purposes of adjusting the dollar Limitation or the defined benefit
dollar limitation, the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the
lesser of 5% or the rate specified for an actuarial equivalent benefit.
      (3)   Actuarial equivalence under this division (H) shall be determined
using a 5% interest assumption. The defined benefit dollar limitation shall be
adjusted annually as provided in Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The
adjusted limitation is effective as of January 1st of each calendar year and is
applicable to "limitation years" ending with or within that calendar year. The
dollar limitation shall not be adjusted except as provided in this division
(H).
      (4)   In the case of disability or survivor benefits provided under the
plan, the limitations of division (F)(3), (H)(1)(a) and (b) of this section
shall not apply to:
         (a)   Income received from the plan as a pension, annuity, or similar
pension as the result of the recipient becoming disabled by reason of personal
injuries or sickness; or
         (b)   Amounts received from a governmental plan by the beneficiaries,
survivors or the estate of a service employee member as the result of the death
of the service employee member.
      (5)   For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation no adjustment
for cost of living increases shall be taken into account before the year for
which such adjustment first takes place.
   (I)   Protection of prior benefits. For any year before 1986, the
limitations prescribed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect
before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent legislation
shall apply, and no pension earned under this plan prior to 1986 shall be
reduced on account of the provisions of divisions (F) through (K) of this
section if it would have satisfied those limitations under that prior law.
   (J)   Application of maximum limitations.
      (1)   The benefit paid under this plan shall not exceed the limitations
set forth in division (F) of this section.
      (2)   If a member on the annuity starting date is not eligible for full
monthly benefits under this plan because of the operation of division (F) of
this section, the monthly benefit shall thereafter be recalculated annually
until the member is receiving a full monthly benefit under the plan's terms
without the operation of this division (J). Each such recalculation shall be
based on this division, with any applicable adjustment to reflect cost of
living increases as permitted by the Treasury Regulations.
   (K)   For plan benefits subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the actuarial equivalent of the annual retirement benefit is equal to the
greater of actuarial equivalent for the particular form of benefit payable and
the equivalent annual benefit computed using the applicable interest rate and
applicable mortality table described below, determined in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
      (1)   The applicable mortality table means the table prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury. Such table shall be based on the prevailing
Commissioner's standard table (described in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts
issued on the date as of which present value is being determined (without
regard to any other subparagraph of Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code). The prevailing Commissioner's standard table for these purposes
currently is the GAM '83 Mortality Table, blended equally between male and
female mortality rates. Effective for distributions occurring after December
31, 2002 the applicable mortality table shall be the table prescribed in Rev.
Rul. 2001-62. Effective for plan years commencing on or after January 1, 2008,
the applicable mortality table shall mean the applicable Section 417(e)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code mortality table as adjusted in accordance with the
provisions of Rev. Rul. 2007-67.
      (2)   The applicable interest rate is the rate of interest set forth in §
31.37(H)(3).
   (L)   For purposes of applying the foregoing limitations of divisions (F)
through (K):
      (1)   All defined benefit plans of the town, whether or not terminated,
are to be treated as one defined benefit plan and all defined contribution
plans of the town, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined
contribution plan;
      (2)   For purposes of divisions (F) through (K), the term "town" shall
include all departments and agencies of the Town of Hamden, Connecticut.

average annual compensation multiplied by the guardian employee member's years
of credited service to a maximum of 20 years; plus
         (b)   One-twelfth (1/12) of 3% of a guardian employee member's average

compensation. For guardian employee members hired before July 1, 1981, the
maximum retirement pension payable may exceed 80% of average annual
compensation, provided that a guardian employee member with more than 80% of
average annual compensation as of June 30, 2006 who continues to work shall
have his/her benefit frozen as of June 30, 2006, based on the guardian employee
member's average annual compensation on such date and benefit accrued as of
such date.
      (3)   The monthly regular pension for a guardian employee member who
terminated service or retired prior to July 1, 1998 shall be equal to the
following, unless the provisions of the plan in effect when the guardian

annual compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to
a maximum of 25 years; plus
         (b)   An additional one-twelfth (1/12) of 3% of a guardian employee
member's average annual compensation multiplied by the number of years of

than a total of 35 years of credited service shall be counted.
      (4)   In the event a guardian employee member has service as both a
guardian employee and a service employee, his/her regular pension attributable
to his/her service as a service employee shall be calculated separately, in
accordance with the provisions of §
31.37, and based upon his/her compensation and years of credited service
accrued while as a service employee.

employee member's average annual compensation, divided by 12, for each year of
credited service, or $3.25, whichever is greater.
      (2)   For guardian employee members who terminated with a vested benefit
before July 1, 1985, their minimum benefit shall be calculated using the
applicable provisions of the plan in effect prior to July 1, 2000.
   (C)   Amount of disability pension.
      (1)   Service related disability pension. A guardian employee member
retiring on a service related disability pension as defined in §
31.36(D) shall receive a monthly benefit equal to the greater of:
         (a)   50% of the guardian employee member's average annual
compensation; or
         (b)   The guardian employee member's monthly regular pension
calculated in accordance with division (A) of this section as of his/her date
of disability.
      (2)   Non-service related disability pension. A guardian employee member
retiring on a non-service related disability pension as defined in § 31.36(E)
shall receive a non-service related disability pension equal to the greater of:
         (a)   For guardian employee employees hired on and after July 1, 1981,
30% of the guardian employee member's average annual compensation determined as
of the date of disability. For guardian employee members hired on or after July
1, 1987, 25% of the guardian employee member's average annual compensation
determined as of the date of disability; or
         (b)   The guardian employee member's monthly regular pension
calculated in accordance with division (A) of this section as of his/her date
of disability.
   (D)   Amount of early retirement pension benefit. The amount of the early
retirement pension benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the
monthly regular pension in division (A) of this section. The early retirement
pension shall not be actuarially reduced to take into account such early
retirement.
   (E)   Vested pension.
      (1)   A guardian employee member shall be entitled to a vested pension
after completion of at least ten years of credited service or ten years of
vesting service. The amount of the vested pension shall be calculated in the
same manner as a regular pension, in accordance with the provisions of the plan
and benefit formula in effect on the date the guardian employee member
terminated employment. The amount of a vested pension shall then be multiplied
by the following percentages if the guardian employee member has less than 15
years of credited service or vesting service:
Years of Credited Service   Percent of Vested Pension
   1-9            0%
   10            50%
   11            60%
   12            70%
   13            80%
   14            90%
   15            100%
      (2)   Entitlement to a vested pension provided by this division (E) shall
be in lieu of all other benefits provided by the plan for such guardian
employee member, his/her spouse and his/her dependent children, except for the
return of the guardian employee member's accumulated contributions.
   (F)   Maximum benefit limitation.
      (1)   (a)   Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary,
for plan years beginning prior to July 1, 2007, the annual benefit of a
guardian employee member hereunder (adjusted to an actuarially equivalent
straight life annuity based upon the interest rate as determined by the PBGC on
January 1 each year) shall not at any time within the limitation year exceed
the lesser of $140,000 (the "dollar limitation") or 100% of the guardian
employee member's average compensation for his/her high three years.
         (b)   For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2007,
notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, in no event shall
the maximum annual retirement benefit attributable to town contributions and
payable to a guardian employee member who has not yet retired under the terms
of the plan, exceed $160,000 (the "defined benefit dollar limitation").
      (2)   The annual retirement benefit payable to a guardian employee member
under the plan shall be deemed not to exceed the applicable maximum limitation
of division (F)(l) if:
         (a)   The annual retirement benefit payable with respect to such
guardian employee member under the plan and under all defined benefit plans of
the town does not exceed $10,000 for the limitation year, or for any prior
limitation year; and
         (b)   The town has not at any time maintained a defined contribution
plan in which the guardian employee member participated.
      (3)   In the event that a guardian employee member has been a member in
the plan less than ten years, the dollar limitation and the defined benefit
dollar limitation, as applicable, shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is his years of participation in the plan (or part thereof)
and the denominator of which is ten. In the event that a member has less than
ten years of vesting service, the $10,000 benefit above, shall be reduced by
multiplication by a fraction, the numerator of which is his years of service
(or part thereof) and the denominator of which is ten.
   (G)   Maximum benefit limitation definitions. For purposes of divisions (F)
through (K) of this section:
      (1)   The term "ANNUAL BENEFIT" shall mean the benefit the guardian
employee member would be entitled to at his/her or her normal retirement date,
assuming he or she continues employment until such date, and that all other
relevant facts used to determine benefits under the plan remain constant as of
the current limitation year for all future limitation years.
      (2)   "ANNUAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT" means a benefit payable annually in the
form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to
which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as
defined in Sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code) are made. A benefit payable in any other form shall be converted to the
actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity for purposes of applying these
limits, based on a 5% interest assumption. Other required adjustments are
provided for in this division. In the event that a guardian employee member's
annual retirement benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity, or if the member's contribute to the plan or make rollover
contributions (as defined in Sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code), the determinations as to whether the limitation
described in division (F)(1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance
with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adjusting such benefit so
that it is the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity (with no
ancillary benefits). For purposes of this division (G)(2), any ancillary
benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not
be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which
constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in Code Section
417) shall not be taken into account. For purposes of adjusting any benefit,
the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5% or the
rate specified for an actuarial equivalent benefit.
      (3)   "COMPENSATION" for purposes of the maximum benefit limitations
under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall mean any and all earnings
reported on W-2 forms completed by the town in respect to the plan year
specified. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for plan years
commencing after December 31, 1997, "Compensation" for this section shall
include (1) any elective deferral (as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code), (2) any amount which is contributed or deferred by the
town at the election of the member and which is not includable in the gross
income of the member by reason of Sections 125 (cafeteria plan) or 457
(nonqualified deferred compensation plan) of the Internal Revenue Code. For
plan years commencing on and after January 1, 2001, "Compensation" shall also
include elective amounts that are not includable in the gross income of the
participant by reason of Section 132(f)(4) (qualified transportation fringes)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective for plan years commencing on or after
July 1, 2007, "Compensation" under this code section for any plan year shall
not be greater than the limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue
Code that applies for that year.
      (4)   "LIMITATION YEAR" shall mean a plan year.
   (H)   Adjustment for early or late commencement of benefits.
      (1)   (a)   For plan years commencing on or after July 1, 2002 and prior
to July 1, 2007, if the annual pension benefit of a member begins before age
62, as described in Section 415(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, the
$140,000 limitation set forth in division (F)(1)(a) of this section shall be
reduced so that it is equivalent to such benefit beginning at the Social
Security retirement age as described in Section 415(b)(8) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the $140,000 limitation set forth in division (F)(1)(a) of this
section shall be reduced so that it is equivalent to such a benefit beginning
at the Social Security retirement age as described in Section 415(b)(8) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The reduction of this division shall not reduce the
limitation of division (F) of this section below $75,000 if the benefit begins
at or after age 55, or, if the benefit begins before age 55, the equivalent of
the $75,000 limitation for age 55. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for
plan years commencing on July 1, 1997 any guardian employee member who has been
a full time employee of the Town Police or Fire Department for at least 15
years shall not have his or her retirement benefit adjusted under this division
(H)(1)(a).
         (b)   Effective for plan years commencing after June 30, 2007, if the
annual benefit of a guardian employee member begins prior to age 62, the
defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the guardian employee member at
such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the
defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the guardian employee member at
age 62 (adjusted under division (H)(3) below, if required). The defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable at an age prior to age 62 is determined as the
lesser of (i) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit
dollar limitation computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the
applicable mortality table and expressing the guardian employee member's age
based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date; or (ii) the
product of the defined benefit dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the
annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the
plan at the guardian employee member's annuity starting date to the annual
amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at
age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of Section 415 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any guardian employee
member with at least 15 years of Guardian as a full time employee of the Police
or Fire Department shall not have their retirement benefit adjusted under this
division (H)(1)(b).
      (2)   In the event that a guardian employee member's annual benefit
commences after age 65, the dollar limitation and defined benefit dollar
limitation, as applicable, shall be increased for the guardian employee
member's age such that it is the actuarial equivalent of defined benefit dollar
limitation commencing at age 65. For purposes of adjusting the defined benefit
dollar Limitation (adjusted under division (H)(3) below, if required), the
interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5% or the rate
specified for an actuarial equivalent benefit.
      (3)   Actuarial equivalence under this division (H) shall be determined
using a 5% interest assumption. The defined benefit dollar Limitation shall be
adjusted annually as provided in Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The
adjusted limitation is effective as of January 1st of each calendar year and is
applicable to "limitation years" ending with or within that calendar year. The
dollar limitation shall not be adjusted except as provided in this division
(H).
      (4)   In the case of disability or survivor benefits provided under the
plan, the limitations of division (F)(3) and (H)(1)(a) and (b) of this section
shall not apply to:
         (a)   Income received from the plan as a pension, annuity, or similar
pension as the result of the recipient becoming disabled by reason of personal
injuries or sickness; or
         (b)   Amounts received from a governmental plan by the beneficiaries,
survivors or the estate of a guardian employee member as the result of the
death of the guardian employee Member.
      (5)   For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation no adjustment
for cost of living increases shall be taken into account before the year for
which such adjustment first takes place.
   (I)   Protection of prior benefits. For any year before 1986, the
limitations prescribed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect
before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent legislation
shall apply, and no pension earned under this plan prior to 1986 shall be
reduced on account of the provisions of divisions (F) through (K) of this
section if it would have satisfied those limitations under that prior law.
   (J)   Application of maximum limitations.
      (1)   The benefit paid under this plan shall not exceed the limitations
set forth in division (F) of this section.
      (2)   If a member on the annuity starting date is not eligible for full
monthly benefits under this plan because of the operation of division (F) of
this section, the monthly benefit shall thereafter be recalculated annually
until the member is receiving a full monthly benefit under the plan's terms
without the operation of this division (J). Each such recalculation shall be
based on this division, with any applicable adjustment to reflect cost of
living increases as permitted by the Treasury Regulations.
   (K)   For plan benefits subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the actuarial equivalent of the annual retirement benefit is equal to the
greater of actuarial equivalent for the particular form of benefit payable and
the equivalent annual benefit computed using the applicable interest rate and
applicable mortality table described below, determined in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
      (1)   The applicable mortality table means the table prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury. Such table shall be based on the prevailing
Commissioner's standard table (described in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts
issued on the date as of which present value is being determined (without
regard to any other subparagraph of Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code). The prevailing Commissioner's standard table for these purposes
currently is the GAM '83 mortality table, blended equally between male and
female mortality rates. Effective for distributions occurring after December
31, 2002 the applicable mortality table shall be the table prescribed in Rev.
Rul. 2001-62. Effective for plan years commencing on or after January 1, 2008,
the applicable mortality table shall mean the applicable Section 417(e)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code mortality table as adjusted in accordance with the
provisions of Rev. Rul. 2007-67.
      (2)   The applicable interest rate is the rate of interest set forth in §
31.38(H)((3).
   (L)   For purposes of applying the foregoing limitations of divisions (F)
through (K):
      (1)   All defined benefit plans of the town, whether or not terminated,
are to be treated as one defined benefit plan and all defined contribution
plans of the town, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined
contribution plan;
      (2)   For purposes of divisions (F) through (K), the term "town" shall
include all departments and agencies of the Town of Hamden, Connecticut.

§ 31.39 FORM AND COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS.
   (A)   Lifetime benefit. The normal form of retirement pension whether
regular, early, disability or vested pension is the lifetime benefit with a
modified cash refund as set forth in §§
31.40(F) or
31.41(E). Payments shall be made in monthly installments, commencing on the
date of retirement and ceasing with the last monthly payment prior to death. In
any case, upon direction of the Retirement Board, an actuarial equivalent lump-
sum payment shall be made in lieu of all benefits if any retirement pension is
less than $120 per annum or has a present value of $5,000 or less.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective March 28, 2005, the member's written
consent shall be required for distributions with a present value of $1,000 or
more.
   (B)   Husband and wife benefit. At or before retirement, a member or
terminated vested member may elect to convert his or her lifetime benefit to an
actuarial equivalent husband and wife benefit, which will pay a reduced
retirement amount during the pensioner's life, with the provision that after
his or her death either 100%, 66-2/3% or 50% of his or her retirement pension
will be paid to the person designated by him, by written designation and duly
acknowledged by the Retirement Board. Should both husband and wife die before
the member's accumulated contributions have been paid out, then §§
31.40(F) or
31.41(E) shall apply.
   (C)   Ten-year certain and life benefit. At or before retirement, a member
may elect to convert his or her life benefit into an actuarial equivalent ten-
year certain and life benefit, which will pay a reduced retirement amount
during the pensioner's life, with a guarantee of 120 payments. Should a member
die prior to receiving 120 payments, the payments shall continue to his or her
designated beneficiary until a combined total of 120 payments have been made.
Should both the member and designated beneficiary die before the member's
accumulated contributions have been paid out, then §§
31.40(F) or
31.41(E) shall apply.
   (D)   Beneficiary election. A member's beneficiary must have been designated
by the member by written designation received by the Retirement Board prior to
the member's death. A member may change his or her beneficiary by similar
written designation received by the Retirement Board prior to receipt of
written notification of the member's death.
   (E)   Required minimum distributions.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provisions in this plan to the contrary, a
member's benefits shall not commence later than the member's required beginning
date which is April 1 of the calendar year following the later of:
         (a)   The calendar year in which the member attains age 70-1/2; or
         (b)   The calendar year in which the member terminates employment. In
any case where a lump sum death benefit is payable to a deceased member's
beneficiary, such benefit shall be paid no later than 60 days following the
member's date of death.
         (c)   Requirements of Treasury Regulations Incorporated. All
distributions required under this division will be determined and made in
accordance with the Treasury regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   The member's entire interest in the plan must be distributed over
the life of the member or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary,
over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or the
life expectancy of the member and designated beneficiary.
      (3)   When a member dies after distribution of benefits has begun, the
remaining portion of the member's interest shall be distributed at least as
rapidly as under the method of distribution prior to the member's death.
      (4)   When a member dies before distribution of benefits has begun, the
entire interest of the member shall be distributed within five years of the
member's death. The five-year payment rule does not apply to any portion of the
member's interest which is payable to a surviving spouse payable over the life
or life expectancy of the spouse, and which begins no later than the date the
member would have reached 70-1/2.
      (5)   The benefits payable must meet the minimum distribution incidental
benefit requirements of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (6)   If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the
year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest
will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth
anniversary of the member's death.
      (7)   If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before
distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this division other than division
(E)(1) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member.
      (8)   Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed
in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single
sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution
calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with divisions (E)(9),
(E)(10) and (E)(ll). If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an
annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be
made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal
Revenue Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest
which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the
requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury
regulations that apply to individual accounts.
      (9)   Determination of amount to be distributed each year.
         (a)   General annuity requirements. If the member's interest is paid
in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity
will satisfy the following requirements:
            1.   The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments
made at intervals not longer than one year;
            2.   The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over
a period certain not longer than the period described in division (E)(10) or
(E)(11).
            3.   Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period
certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the
maximum permitted;
            4.   Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as
follows:
               a.   By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the
annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of
all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
               b.   To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the
member's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the
beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period
described in division (E)(10) dies or is no longer the member's beneficiary
pursuant to a qualified Domestic Relations Order within the meaning of Section
414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code;
               c.   To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the
member's death; or
               d.   To pay increased benefits that result from a plan
amendment.
         (b)   Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date.
The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required
beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date
distributions are required to begin under divisions (E)(1) or (E)(4) is the
payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not
be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment
interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for
which payments are received, e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually, or
annually. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of
the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's
required beginning date.
         (c)   Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any
additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first
distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment
interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which such amount accrues.
      (10)   Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during member
lifetime.
         (a)   Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the member's
spouse. If the member's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint
and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a non-spouse
beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's required
beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death must not
at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such
period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in
Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of
distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
member and a non-spouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the
requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made
to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
         (b)   Period certain annuities. Unless the member's spouse is the sole
designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no
life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during
the member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the
member under the uniform lifetime table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of
the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity
starting date if the annuity starting date precedes the member is the
distribution period for age 70 under the uniform lifetime table set forth in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over
the age of the member as of the member's birthday in the year that contains the
annuity starting date if the member's spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life
annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the member's
applicable distribution period, as determined under this division (E)(10)(b),
or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the member's
spouse as determined under the joint and last survivor table set forth in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the member's and
spouse's attained ages as of the member's and spouse's birthdays in the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
      (11)   Requirements for minimum distributions where member dies before
date distributions begin.
         (a)   Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies
before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a
designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest will be distributed,
beginning no later than the time described in divisions (E)(1) or (E)(4) and
except as otherwise provided in division (E)(4) over the life of the designated
beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:
            1.   Unless the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary
determined using the beneficiary age as of the beneficiary birthday in the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the member's death; or
            2.   If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution
calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined
using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar
year that contains the annuity starting date.
         (b)   No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date
distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30
of the year following the year of the member's death, distribution of the
member's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year
containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.
         (c)   Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving
spouse begin. If the member dies before the date distribution of his or her
interest begins, the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated
beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the
surviving spouse begin, division (E)(ll) will apply as if the surviving spouse
were the member, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be
determined without regard to division (E)(1).
      (12)   Definitions.
         (a)   Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the
beneficiary under §
31.39(D) and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code and Section 1.401 (a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury
regulations.
         (b)   Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum
distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's
death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately
preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning
date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first
distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are
required to begin pursuant to division (E)(4).
         (c)   Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the
single life table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.
   (F)   Return to employment after commencement of benefits.
      (1)   A retired member who returns to employment with the town after
benefits have commenced shall have his or her benefit suspended for each month
he or she is in the employ of the town, unless the member meets the following
conditions:
         (a)   The member's application for active employment is approved by
the Retirement Board; or
         (b)   In the case of a service employee, the member is regularly
scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week; or
         (c)   The member is a guardian employee who is rehired as a service
employee or the member is a service employee who is rehired as a guardian
employee.
      (2)   A retired member whose benefits are suspended in accordance with
this division shall have his or her pension amount recalculated to recognize

of such service employee member; provided, however that the service employee
member's death:
         (a)   Occurs due to bodily injury arising out of the course of the
service employee member's employment with the town within the meaning of the
worker's compensation laws of the State of Connecticut; and

death and divided by 12.
      (2)   For periods prior to July 1, 1991, the monthly surviving spouse

      (4)   The former spouse of an active service employee member shall not be
entitled to a pre-retirement surviving spouse pension unless a Domestic
Relations Order determined to be approved by the Retirement Board requires the
payment of such a benefit.
      (5)   The pre-retirement surviving spouse pension shall be payable until
the death or remarriage of the surviving spouse. In the event the surviving
spouse does not notify the Retirement Board within 30 days of her remarriage,

benefit shall be payable to the surviving dependent child(ren) of the service
employee member in an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of 25% of the service
employee member's average annual compensation in addition to all other benefits
hereunder. Such monthly benefit shall be divided equally in the case of more
than one dependent child and shall be payable until the dependent child attains

      (2)   The Retirement Board shall direct payment of this benefit on behalf

duly designated beneficiary, or other executor or administrator of the service
employee member's estate as designated by the Retirement Board.
   (G)   Non-duplication of benefits. If a service employee member has elected

§ 31.42 COST OF LIVING BENEFIT.
   (A)   Cost of living benefit. On each May 1, subsequent to the date
retirement benefits become payable to any pensioner or beneficiary, an
adjustment shall be made in the yearly amount of the benefit payable to the
retired member, as described in division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Determination of cost of living adjustment.
      (1)   For the purposes of determining the cost of living benefit, the
following terms are defined:
         (a)   "ANNUITANT." Each pensioner, contingent annuitant or beneficiary
who is receiving retirement benefits under this plan.
         (b)   "BASE INDEX."
            1.   Shall mean the Consumer Price Index for the month of January
in the calendar year in which the pensioner or beneficiary's benefit first
became payable.
            2.   If the Bureau of Labor Statistics subsequently adjusts the
basis upon which the Consumer Price Index is determined, then the base index
will be adjusted, as of the next January, by multiplying the base index by the
ratio of that Consumer Price Index for said January on the new basis bears to
the Consumer Price Index for the said January on the prior January.
         (c)   "BASE PENSION." The monthly pension benefit which first became
payable to the pensioner or Beneficiary, whichever is applicable.
         (d)   "CONSUMER PRICE INDEX." The Consumer Price Index (U.S. All Items
Index) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
      (2)   On each May 1, the cost of living benefit shall be determined. The
adjustment with respect to each pensioner or beneficiary shall be equal to the
excess of (a) over (b) below, if any, where:
         (a)   Is equal to the amount obtained by dividing the Consumer Price
Index, as of the immediately preceding January, by the pensioner's base index.
This quotient shall be multiplied by the pensioner's base pension. In no event
may the amount determined in this division be greater than 3% of the last
amount determined in accordance with this division (B)(2)(a); and
         (b)   Is equal to the annuitant's base pension.
      (3)   Such cost of living benefit will be applicable to such annuitant
only if division (B)(2)(a) above exceeds division (B)(2)(b). Any excesses over
3% described in division (B)(2)(a) will be carried over to succeeding years, to
be utilized in the event that the maximum rate is not achieved in succeeding
years.
      (4)   On the May 1 on which a cost of living benefit is first applicable
to an annuitant and on the first day of each month thereafter on which such
individual continues to receive retirement benefits under this plan, he/she
will be eligible for a cost of living benefit in an amount equal to one-twelfth
(1/12) of the yearly cost of living benefit most recently determined for him,
if applicable, in accordance with this division (B).
      (5)   Notwithstanding divisions (B)(2) and (B)(3) above, the cost of
living benefit applied as of each May 1 in certain years prior to 2014, up to
and including May 1, 2013 inclusive was 3% (the “3% Presumption”) regardless of
whether the formula in division (B)(2) would have yielded a lower percentage
cost of living benefit. This division (B)(5), effective as of the date of
enactment and retroactively as necessary, confirms and ratifies all pension
payments made to Members or their Beneficiaries prior to September 1, 2020, to
the extent such payments were higher than would otherwise have been the case
because of the application of the 3% Presumption. This division (B)(5) shall
have no effect on pension payments made on or after September 1, 2020, which
shall be calculated and paid under the regular provisions of the Plan without
regard to the 3% Presumption.
   (C)   Adjustment for former retired members. A member who retired prior to
July 1, 1986 shall be entitled to an increase in his/her retirement benefit as
effective July 1, 1986, of 1% of his/her retirement benefit for each full year
from his/her annuity starting date to the effective date of this provision.

§ 31.43 FUNDING.
   (A)   Member contributions.
      (1)   As a condition of employment, a member shall make member
contributions to the plan in accordance with the provisions of the plan or such
other previous or subsequent agreement that sets forth the requirement of
member contributions to the plan.
      (2)   A member shall be 100% vested in his/her member contributions at
all times.
   (B)   Contributions by the town. It is the intention of the town to continue
the plan and to make regular contributions thereto each year.
      (1)   The contributions of the town shall consist of the following:
         (a)   A normal contribution each year equal to the percentage of the
compensation of all members computed to be required to cover the cost of
benefits currently accruing under the plan not provided by member contributions
and the administrative expenses of the plan.
         (b)   Until the cost (not covered by normal contributions) of the
credits of members for service prior to the date of adoption of the plan with
regular interest on any unpaid amounts of such cost has been liquidated, the
contribution of the town each year shall include a prior service contribution
towards the payment thereof, in such amount, as determined by the actuary, as
shall be sufficient to liquidate such prior service cost (including regular
interest on the unpaid portion thereof) in full within 40 years from the date
of adoption of plan changes.
         (c)   The full amount of all accidental death benefits payable under
the plan, to be paid to the trustee within 90 days after the payment of such
benefit from the fund.
      (2)   The percentage normal contribution rate shall be computed at the
time of each actuarial valuation as the percent of the compensation of all
members required each year to cover the cost of all benefits to be provided by
contributions of the town not covered by the sum of the funds in hand held
therefor plus any prior service contributions remaining to be paid. Following
each actuarial valuation, the actuary shall certify to the Retirement Board
his/her recommendation as to the percentage normal contribution rate.
      (3)   As of the date of the effective date of the plan, the actuary shall
determine the present value of all benefits to be provided by contributions of
the town on account of members as of said date, and shall subtract therefrom
the sum of the funds in hand as of the date of adoption held therefor and the
present value of future normal contributions on account of such members at the
rate required to provide the membership service benefits under the plan to be
provided by contributions of the town for the average member. The difference
shall be known as the "initial prior service cost."
   (C)   Forfeitures. No part of any forfeitures resulting from the application
of any provision of this plan shall be applied to increase the benefits any
member would otherwise receive under this plan. Forfeitures shall be used to
reduce contributions of the town.
   (D)   Management of assets.
      (1)   Until and unless otherwise determined by the Retirement Board, all
the funds of the plan shall be held by a trustee, which shall be the Retirement
Board itself, for use in providing the benefits of the plan and paying the
expenses of the plan.
      (2)   The Retirement Board, with the prior approval of the Mayor of the
town, may at any time and to any extent use the funds of the plan in whole or
in part to fund the retirement pensions and other benefits provided by the plan
by means of one or more annuity or life insurance contracts issued by any
insurer selected by the Retirement Board.
      (3)   No part of the corpus or income of the trust shall be used for or
diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members or their
beneficiaries and contingent annuitants under the plan, prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to them; and no person shall have
any interest in or right to any part of the earnings of the trust, or any
rights in, or to, or under the trust or any part of the assets thereof, except
as and to the extent expressly provided for in the plan and in the trust
instrument. The town shall have no liability for the payment of benefits under
the plan nor for the administration of the funds paid over to the trustee.

      (4)   No member of the Retirement Board who is an employee of the town
shall receive any compensation for his/her services as such, and no bond or

§ 31.45 AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Amendments. This plan may be discontinued or amended in any respect at
any time by action of the Legislative Council of the town, subject to
applicable general laws and special acts of the State of Connecticut, provided
that no such discontinuance or amendment shall adversely affect the rights of
members or their beneficiaries which had become fully vested at the date of
discontinuance or amendment, nor to make it possible for any part of the funds
of the plan to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive
benefit of members and their beneficiaries or contingent annuitants under the
plan, prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect
to them.
   (B)   Termination. The town, by action of its Legislative Council, may
terminate the plan for any reason at any time. In case of termination of the

exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries and contingent annuitants
as of the last date of payment of any contributions hereunder, except that any
funds not required to satisfy all liabilities of the plan for benefits because
of erroneous actuarial calculations shall be returned to the town. Each member

contributions, and each retired member or his/her contingent annuitant in
receipt of a retirement pension shall be entitled to a share equal to any
excess of the accumulated contributions at retirement over the amount of
benefits received. Each such member, retired member or contingent annuitant
shall then be entitled to the additional share required to provide a total
share equal to such proportionate part of the funds of the plan as the reserve
computed to be required for his/her credits bears to the total of all such
reserves required under the plan, as determined by the Retirement Board on the
basis of actuarial valuation; provided that if the funds remaining are
insufficient to provide in full for such additional shares, the additional
shares shall be reduced proportionately. The Retirement Board may require that

§ 31.46 CERTAIN RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Minors and incompetents. If any person to whom a benefit is payable
from the plan is a minor, or if the Retirement Board determines that any person
to whom such benefit is payable is incompetent by reason of age, physical or
mental disability, any payment due (unless a proper claim therefor shall have
been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or legal representative)
may be made to the spouse, a child, a parent or a brother or sister of such
person, or to any person deemed by the Retirement Board to have incurred
expenses for such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall
be a complete discharge of any liability for such payment under the plan.
   (B)   Non-alienation of benefits.
      (1)   No benefit under the plan shall be subject at any time, in any
manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or
encumbrances of any kind. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber any such benefits, whether presently or thereafter
payable, shall be void. No retirement benefit nor the trust fund shall in any
manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liability of any employee,
terminated vested member, member, beneficiary or pensioner entitled to any
retirement benefit. If the employee, member, former member, beneficiary or
pensioner shall attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or
otherwise encumber the member benefit under the plan or any part thereof, or if
by reason of the member's bankruptcy or other event happening at any time, such
benefits would devolve upon anyone else or would not be enjoyed by him, then
the town, in its discretion, may terminate the member's interest in any such
benefit, and hold or apply it to or for the benefit of such person, the
member's spouse, children, or other dependent or any of them, in such manner as
the town may deem proper.
      (2)   Division (B)(1) shall not apply to the creation, assignment or
recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a member pursuant
to a Domestic Relations Order that is approved by the Retirement Board in
accordance with the provisions of the plan and the approved domestic relations
order policies and procedures which are made a part of the plan by reference.
   (C)   Tenure of employment. Neither the action of the town in the
establishment of this plan nor any action taken by it or by the Retirement
Board hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee or member the right
to be retained in the employ of the town or any other right whatsoever, except
to the extent of the benefits provided by the plan to be paid or made available
from the fund.
   (D)   Non-liability of town. All benefits under the plan shall be paid or
provided for solely from the trust fund and the town assumes no liabilities or
responsibilities therefor.
   (E)   Unclaimed benefits. Whenever reasonable efforts fail to locate any
member or beneficiary entitled to benefits under the plan within seven years
from the time the notice is first received that he/she is not to be found at
the address in the records of the town, or the trustee, the Retirement Board
may direct that any benefits to which the member may be entitled shall
thereupon be canceled and no payment shall be made thereafter to anyone with
respect to the benefits so canceled.
   (F)   Applicable law. The validity of the provisions of this plan shall be
determined and construed according to the laws of the State of Connecticut and
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
   (G)   Claims procedure. Any denial of a claim for benefits under the plan
shall be stated in writing by the Retirement Board and delivered or mailed to
the member or beneficiary whose claim for benefits has been denied, and shall
set forth specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to
be understood by such member or beneficiary. Within 60 days after receiving the
notification of such denial, any such member or beneficiary may notify the
Retirement Board in writing of the member's desire for a review of such
decision. Upon such notification, the Retirement Board shall schedule a review
proceeding at which the member shall restate the member's arguments for such
claim to a representative of the Retirement Board. The Retirement Board's
decision following such hearing shall be made within 30 days, and shall be
communicated in writing to the member.
   (H)   Qualified plan. The plan is intended to be a governmental plan under
Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, and "qualified" as such under
Section 401 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (I)   Return of town contributions under special circumstances. Any town
contribution made under a mistake of fact or law may be returned to the town
within one year following the date the town became aware of such mistake.
(Ord. 435, passed 3-12-01; Am. Ord. 666, passed 12-7-15)
§ 31.47 ROLLOVER PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Direct rollovers. Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
division a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the Retirement Board in accordance with applicable regulations, to have any
portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
      (1)   A distributee who is entitled to elect a direct rollover with
respect to all or any portion of a distribution but who does not make any
election shall be deemed to have rejected the direct rollover option.
      (2)   A distributee who elects a direct rollover with respect to any
eligible rollover distribution that is one in a series of installment payments
made at least annually over a period of less than ten years shall be deemed to
have made the same election with respect to all subsequent eligible rollover
distributions in the series unless and until the distributee changes the
election. A change of election shall be accomplished by notifying the
Retirement Board of the change in the form and manner prescribed by the
Retirement Board.
      (3)   Within a reasonable period of time before an eligible rollover
distribution is to be made, the Retirement Board shall provide to the
distributee an explanation of the right to elect a direct rollover and the
federal tax withholding consequences of failing to elect a direct rollover. A
distributee who elects a direct rollover must provide all information that the
Retirement Board may require to complete the direct rollover.
      (4)   For the purposes of this division, the following definitions will
apply:
         (a)   A "DIRECT ROLLOVER" is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
         (b)   Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former
employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and
the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the
alternate payee under a qualified Domestic Relations Order, as defined in
Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, are distributees with regard to
the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A distributee also includes the
member's nonspouse designated beneficiary under § 31.39(D). In the case of a
non-spouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual
retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or Section 408(b)
("IRA") of the Internal Revenue Code that is established on behalf of the
designated beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to
the provisions of Section 402(c)(ll) of the Internal Revenue Code. Also, in
this case, the determination of any required minimum distribution under Section
401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code that is ineligible for rollover shall be
made in accordance with Notice 2007-7, Q&A 17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.
         (c)   Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an
individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of
the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement
account or individual retirement annuity. For plan years commencing after
December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity
contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code
Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a
state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of
a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also
apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation
order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code. For
distributions made after December 31, 2007, a participant or beneficiary may
elect to roll over directly an "eligible rollover distribution" to a Roth IRA
described in Section 408A(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (d)   Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover
distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does
not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or
life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities), any hardship distribution
described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code received
after December 31, 1998 and effective for plan years commencing after December
31, 2001, any amount that is distributed on account of hardship. For plan years
commencing after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distribution shall not fail
to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
after-tax employee contributions that are not includable in gross income.
However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement
account or annuity described in Sections 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue
Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Sections 401(a)
or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to separately account for
amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includable.
      (5)   A distribution of less than $200 that would otherwise be an
eligible rollover distribution as defined above shall not be an eligible
rollover distribution if it is reasonable to expect that all such distributions
to the distributee from the plan during the same calendar year will total less
than $200.
   (B)   Rollovers to the plan. In no event shall the plan accept eligible
rollovers from any source unless a re-employed member is making a repayment of
his/her member contributions in accordance with the provisions of §
31.34(E).

RETIREE HEALTH CARE PLAN
§ 31.50 RETIREE HEALTH CARE TRUST.
   (A)   Establishment. In accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat., § 7-450(a), the
town shall establish a trust fund (“Trust”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or
such other qualified financial institution approved by the Legislative Council,
to hold and invest all contributions and assets of the town’s retiree health
care plan (“Plan”). The Legislative Council shall have the authority to amend
or terminate the Trust.
   (B)   Purpose. The Trust shall be for the purpose of funding current and
future postemployment health care benefits for eligible retired employees of
the town in accordance with the Plan. The Trust may also be used for the
purpose of funding any other postemployment health and life plans as the town
may establish.
   (C)   Trustees. The Mayor and the President of the Legislative Council shall
serve as the trustees (“Trustees”) of the Trust. The Trustees shall have such
powers and duties as set forth in the terms of the Trust, including, but not
limited to, making payments or other disbursements in accordance with the Plan
and the terms of the Trust and directing the investment of the assets of the
Trust. The approval of both Trustees shall be required for the transaction of
all business pertaining to the Trust.
   (D)   Administration. The Trustees shall serve as the Plan Administrator of
the Plan and shall have such powers and duties as set forth in the Plan and the
Trust with respect to the administration of the Plan, including, but not
limited to, providing all proper instructions and directions to the Trustee
regarding the investment of moneys on deposit in the Trust and disbursements
from the Trust. The Trustees shall provide a report to the Legislative Council,
including deposits, disbursements and assets held in the Trust, and such other
information as shall be requested by the Legislative Council, on at least an
annual basis, or more frequently as requested by the Legislative Council.

   (B)   Subsequent to the hearing the Commission shall have the power to do
the following:
      (1)   If the Commission determines after a hearing that the rental charge
or proposed increase in the rental charge for any housing accommodation is so
excessive, based on the standards and criteria set forth in §
33.79 as to be harsh and unconscionable, it may order that the rent be limited
to such an amount as it determines to be fair and equitable, effective the
month in which the party or parties filed the complaint or, in the discretion
of the Commission and consistent with the evidence presented at the hearing, to
a date prior to the filing of the complaint. A Commission's orders may include,
but are not limited to:
         (a)   A reduction in a rental charge or proposed rent increase;
         (b)   A delay in an increased rental charge until specified
conditions, such as compliance with municipal code enforcement orders, have
been satisfied; or
         (c)   A phase-in of an increase in a rental charge, not to exceed a
fair and equitable rent, in stages over a period of time.
      (2)   Any order of the Commission shall remain in effect for one year
unless the Commission orders a different timeframe. Upon its own motion or the
request of any party, the Commission may grant a further hearing and modify the
timeframe of such order due to noncompliance or change in circumstances.
      (3)   If the Commission determines after a hearing that a housing
accommodation fails to comply with any municipal ordinance or state statute or
regulation relating to health and safety, the Commission may order the
suspension or reduction of further payment of rent by the party or parties
until such time as the landlord makes the necessary changes, repairs or
installations so as to bring the housing accommodation into compliance with
such laws, statutes, or regulations. The Commission may order that the rent
during such period shall be paid to the Commission to be held in escrow subject
to such ordinances or provisions as may be adopted by the town. Upon the
landlord's full compliance with such ordinance, statute or regulation for which
payments were made into such escrow, the Commission shall, in its sole
discretion, determine after hearing such distribution of the escrowed funds.
      (4)   Refer the matter to the appropriate town agency or the law
enforcement authorities for enforcement of the appropriate municipal ordinance,
Connecticut General Statute or state regulation, if the Commission determines
that the housing accommodation in question fails to comply with any municipal
ordinance or Connecticut General Statute or state regulation relating to health
and safety.
      (5)   Dismiss the complaint.
      (6)   Continue, review, terminate, or suspend all of its orders and
decisions.
      (7)   Continue the complaint for final disposition if it finds that the
complaint involves a matter which can be corrected or adjusted between the
parties and it finds that such a continuance would be appropriate under the
circumstances.
      (8)   Order payments of the rent in escrow to the Commission with the
option to order temporary reduction or suspension of the rent until the
landlord has corrected the situation.
      (9)   Order the posting of a sufficient performance bond by the landlord

which the appropriate authorities have investigated and have certified to the
Commission as existing code violations relating to health and safety.

47a-20 and subsection (b) of § 47a-23c of the Connecticut General Statutes.

party or parties included in the complaint, and
         (b)   Issue individual orders tailored to the particular circumstances
of individual parties of a consolidated complaint.
      (12)   At the conclusion of the hearing or investigation, the Commission
will notify each complainant in writing of the decision of the Commission. Any
order and notice of the Commission shall include an advisement to the parties
of their right to appeal to the Superior Court.

dwelling space.

continue to pay the amount of the last rent prior to the increase complained of
or, if there is no such increase, the last agreed-upon rent to the landlord

or financial institution into which it shall deposit all rents or other funds
paid to it within five business days of receipt. The funds shall be held in the
escrow savings account until such time as the order of the Commission is
complied with; or until the Commission acts on the complaint, or makes other
appropriate orders; or until a further order is made by a court of competent

payable.
   In addition, at its discretion, the Commission may order payment of the full
balance to the landlord in cases of unusual hardship. Any interest earned may
be used as above provided and, upon payment of the balance to the landlord, the
interest shall be remitted to the landlord. Any funds or interest unclaimed by

§ 33.83 COMPLAINTS REGARDING RETALIATORY EVICTIONS.
   The Commission is authorized to carry out the provisions of the General
Statutes (§ 47a-20) pertaining to prohibited retaliatory actions by landlords.
This section prohibits retaliation for a tenant making a good faith (1) effort
to bring the dwelling in compliance with state and local laws and regulations,
including filing a complaint; (2) request for reasonable repairs; and (3)
effort to require the landlord to meet his legal responsibilities. Retaliation
is also prohibited following the notice of a municipal health or safety
violation or if the tenant organizes or joins a tenants union.
   (A)   No landlord shall engage in retaliatory actions.
   (B)   In the initial notice scheduling a hearing or conciliation on a
complaint, and in its notice of decision, the Commission shall include notice,
in plain language, to all complainant and respondent parties that retaliatory
actions against tenants are prohibited.
   (C)   Retaliatory actions by a landlord include but are not limited to the
following:
      (1)   Engaging in any action prohibited by C.G.S. § 47a-20 or § 21-80a
within six months after any event listed in such statutes, including but not
limited to within six months after a party or parties has or have filed a
complaint with the Commission.
      (2)   Refusing to renew the lease or other rental agreement of any party
or parties, bringing an action or proceeding against any party or parties to
recover possession of the dwelling unit, demanding an increase in rent from the
party or parties, decreasing the services to which the party or parties has or
have previously been entitled, verbally, physically or sexually harassing the
party or parties because of the fielding of a complaint with the Commission or
engaging in other protected activity as set forth in § 47a-20 of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
      (3)   Engaging in any other action determined by the Commission, after a
hearing, to constitute landlord retaliation as set forth in C.G.S. § 7-148d(b).
   (D)   Any party or parties who claims that his or her landlord has engaged
in retaliatory action may file a notice of said claim with the Commission.
   (E)   It shall be an affirmative defense against a claim of retaliatory
action when the landlord seeks to recover possession of the dwelling unit if:
      (1)   The party is using the dwelling for an illegal purpose.
      (2)   There is non-payment of rent by the party. Failure to pay a
disputed rent increase is not a non-payment of rent.
      (3)   The landlord in good faith seeks to recover the dwelling unit for
immediate use as his or her own abode.
      (4)   The conditions complained of were caused by the willful actions of
the party or another person in the party's household or a person on the
premises with the party's consent.
      (5)   The landlord seeks to recover possession of the dwelling unit on
the basis of a notice to terminate a periodic tenancy previous to the tenant's
complaint.
   (F)   It shall be an affirmative defense against a claim of retaliatory
action when the landlord seeks an increase in rent if:
      (1)   The conditions complained of were caused by the lack of due care by
the tenant or another person of his or her household or a person on the
premises with his or her consent; or
      (2)   The landlord has become liable for a substantial increase in
property taxes, or a substantial increase in other maintenance or operating
costs not associated with his or her compliance with the complaint, not less
than four months prior to the demand for an increase in rent, and the increase
in rent does not exceed the prorated portion of the net increase in taxes or
costs.
   (G)   Upon receipt of notice of a claim of retaliatory action, the
Commission shall inform the landlord and shall investigate the claim. Within 15
days, the Commission shall convene a hearing after due notice to the tenant and
the landlord for the purpose of determining whether the landlord has engaged in
retaliatory action.
   (H)   Pending determination by the Commission, the Commission may order that
the landlord maintain no action or proceeding against the party to recover
possession of the dwelling unit, the landlord restore those services decreased
by him or her to which the party was entitled, or the party continue to pay the
rent required prior to the retaliatory action complained of.
   (I)   If, after a hearing, the Commission finds that the landlord has
engaged in retaliatory action, it shall order the landlord to cease and desist
from such actions. This cease-and-desist order may include, but is not limited
to, the following provisions:
      (1)   That the landlord maintain no action against the party to recover
possession of the dwelling unit or withdraw any action pending.
      (2)   That the landlord not increase the rent.

Commission determines fair and equitable.
      (4)   That the landlord restore the services to which the party was
entitled.
      (5)   That the landlord cease and desist all verbal, physical or sexual
harassment of the party.

§ 33.84 CONTINUATION OF PROCEEDINGS.
   All proceedings shall continue regardless of the fact that a party may quit
the housing accommodation in question. However, the Commission may consider the
complaint abandoned if the tenant, after receiving notice of a hearing, fails
without good cause to appear at the hearing. No sale, assignment, or transfer
of the housing accommodation in question shall be cause for discontinuing any
pending proceeding, nor shall it affect the rights, duties, and obligations of
the Commission or the parties thereto.

   All notices with regard to any complaint shall be served by certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and by regular first class mail, and
if practicable, by electronic mail, upon the landlord and the tenant as
complainant and respondent parties. If all notices to a party are returned
without having been delivered, the Commission may arrange for service by a

   (B)   Before observations are made, the pit shall be thoroughly wet down by
filling it to a depth of at least 12 inches. The pit shall then be refilled
with water to a depth of 12 inches or more and the rate of drop of water
measured at intervals for a period of 30 to 60 minutes under normal conditions.
The minimum or slowest uniform rate of drop shall be used in calculating
seepage areas. When tests are made, consideration shall be given to the
finished grade of building sites so that results will correspond to the
absorptive value of the soil in which the leaching systems will be constructed.
In investigating soil conditions for a large area, one test pit per acre or
even one per lot may be required. Also, in investigating soil conditions, deep
test pits may be required to check for ground water, ledge rock, or available
good seepage soil below normal depths.
('66 Code, § 57-16)
§ 50.16 Leaching area required.
   (A)   The following leaching areas are required for the seepage rates
indicated:
 
Minimum uniform seepage rate time Square feet of effective seepage area
to drop one inch                  required per bedroom
                                  1   2   3   4
(1)   5 minutes or less        125 250 375 500
(2)   6 to 10 minutes          165 330 495 660
(3)   11 to 20 minutes         225 450 675 900
(4)   21 to 30 minutes         250 500 750 1000
                                  Special consideration needed to avoid
(5)   More than 30 minutes     nuisance conditions. In some soils it may be
                                  impracticable or impossible to use subsurface
                                  disposal.
 
      (6)   Where a seepage rate slower than one inch in 30 minutes or high
ground water is found, no sewage disposal system shall be built. In impervious
soil, swamp or rock it may not be feasible to provide subsurface sewage
disposal.
   (B)   All trenches shall follow contours with the bottoms of the individual
trenches level. Depth of trenches should normally be not more than 30 to 36
inches, but depths up to 48 inches or greater may be used if warranted by
conditions of topography or more favorable absorption capacity of soil at that
depth. The width of the trench shall not exceed 36 inches and the spacing
between adjacent sides of trenches shall be at least 3 times the width of the
trench. The length of individual trenches shall not exceed 75 feet except that
in installations where dosing apparatus is used, a maximum length of 100 feet
may be used. Distributing pipe shall be laid near the top of a layer of one
inch screened gravel or one inch broken stone placed to a depth of at least 18
inches in the trenches. The depth of stone under the pipe invert shall be at
least 12 inches. Distributing pipes may be unglazed drain tile, at least 4
inches in diameter, laid with open joints. Pipe of vitrified tile or other
acceptable material with suitable perforations or adequate spacing may also be
used. The upper portions of joint openings shall be protected by strips of tar
paper or other suitable material. Tile lines shall be laid on a grade not
exceeding 2 to 4 inches per 100 feet. A layer of salt hay or tar paper shall be
placed over the gravel before backfilling the trenches.
   (C)   Construction shall be such as to provide for proper distribution of
settled sewage to trenches. Better distribution, particularly for large systems
with several trenches, is secured in tile fields by using siphon dosing
apparatus to apply the septic tank effluent. Diverting boxes with several
outlets of the same elevation to individual trenches may be used to distribute
the sewage. Where trenches are at different levels, serial distribution may be
used with high-level overflows from upper to lower trenches.
   (D)   In seepage beds where space between trenches is also excavated and
.backfilled with one inch stone or one inch screened gravel, only 1/3 of the
total bottom area shall be considered effective. Distributing pipe shall be
laid 6 feet to 8 feet on centers. Installation of stone and distributing pipe
shall be the same as that required for leaching trenches. The bottom of the
entire bed shall be at the same elevation.
   (E)   Leaching cesspools shall be spaced 3 times the diameter between sides
of adjacent cesspools. Cesspool walls shall be constructed with masonry laid
with open joints below the maximum liquid level. The walls shall be surrounded
by 12 inches of screened gravel or broken stone.
('66 Code, § 57-17)
§ 50.17 Commercial buildings.
   No discharges from systems of sewage disposal for commercial building into
watercourses shall be made unless provided with treatment as approved by the
state department of health and the state water resources commission. No sewage
disposal system shall, after the effective date of the regulation, be
constructed or rebuilt for any commercial buildings without compliance with the
following subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the director of health.
Connections shall be made to public sewers if available.
   (A)   The location of the disposal system shall comply with the same
requirements as those listed above, except that in the case of discharges from
laundromats or other commercial or industrial establishments discharging
substantial quantities of detergents, the disposal system shall not be
permitted, unless special plans are prepared and carried out in accordance with
requirements of the local director of health with due regard to the seepage
quality of the soil and location of wells. Disposal systems receiving
substantial quantities of detergents shall be located at least 200 feet away
from any well used as a source of drinking water.
   (B)   The septic tank shall comply with §
50.12 with regard to construction details and shall have a minimum liquid
capacity of 2 cubic feet per employee or equal to the average 24 hour flow,
whichever is greater. In no case shall a septic tank be installed with a liquid
capacity less than 100 cubic feet. For very large commercial buildings, special
arrangements may be required by the director of health. In the case of
restaurants, laundromats, toilets for public use, or other types of
establishments where water use and sewage flows will depend on the extent of
public use or employment of water uses especially pertinent to the type of
establishment in question, special allowances for capacities of disposal units
and area for future expansion shall be provided as approved by the director of
health.
   (C)   Seepage systems for commercial buildings other than restaurants* and
laundries* shall be designed in accordance with the following table:

§ 51.06 ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS.
   (A)   The assessable buildable unit method shall be adopted for direct
benefits. The area assessment method shall be adopted for overall area
benefits. These two methods will include all costs and assessments.
      (1)   The assessable buildable unit shall be defined as an existing
constructed single-family residence, constructed on an allowable sized lot
according to zoning, and which is benefitted by the improvement.
      (2)   The overall area benefit charge shall be based on the actual square
footage of area involved, or 30,000 square feet per buildable unit, whichever
is the smaller figure.
   (B)   Properties which are vacant, either of allowable size, according to
zoning, or potentially allowable size, and on which a use has not been
established, shall be considered as subject to deferred payment assessment
which will be properly documented in the land records to protect the town for
future assessments when property is put to use.
   (C)   Existing uses of properties other than single-family residence will be
converted to buildable units for assessment purposes in accordance with the
following rules.
      (1)   Multiple dwellings. One buildable unit for the first unit and
thence:
         0.25 unit for each additional one-bedroom unit;
         0.50 unit for each additional two-bedroom unit;
         0.75 unit for each additional three-bedroom unit.
      (2)   Commercial property. One buildable unit minimum for the first 1500
square feet or less of possible buildable area based on zoning requirements to
the maximum of 30% building to lot coverage of the buildable area of the lot,
thence 1/15 of a buildable unit for each 100 square feet of additional
buildable area.
      (3)   Manufacturing property. One buildable unit minimum for the first
10,000 square feet or less of possible buildable area based on zoning
requirements to the maximum of 50% building to lot coverage of the buildable
area of the lot, thence 1/10 of a buildable unit for each 1000 square feet of
additional buildable area.
   (D)   On all shapes and sizes of property, the foregoing rules shall govern
insofar as applicable. The Water Pollution Control Authority shall have the
discretionary power to apply a method of determining assessable units in all

§ 51.58 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES, GENERALLY.
   In those instances where water meters are provided on the sources of water
providing water to the facilities discharging into the sanitary sewer system of
the town, portable water usage will be determined from the water meter readings
for the purpose of determining the sewer service charge, except as may be
modified or amended by the WPCA with the approval of the Legislative Council
from time to time. As to such water sources that are not metered, estimates of
water usage will be made.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.59 ALLOWANCE FOR METERED WATER NOT DISCHARGED INTO TOWN'S SANITARY SEWER
SYSTEM.
   (A)   Any person owning or having control of property discharging waste into
the sanitary sewers of the town and on whose property there is located one or
more facilities requiring water from the source of supply that also furnishes
water to the sanitary sewer system, and such water provided to the town, may at
his or her own expense install a water meter of a type and design, and at a
location, approved by the General Manager, and the WPCA will accept readings
from such meter taken and provided to the WPCA by such person or his or her
duly authorized agent, such readings to be furnished on forms provided by the
General Manager and sworn to as correct by the person taking the reading.
Meters installed for this purpose shall be sealed by the WPCA, and the owners
shall ensure that said seal is not broken.
   (B)   The amount of water measured by the reading of such meter will be used
to adjust the water usage upon which the user charge established by this
chapter will be computed. In the event such property is not supplied water by
the company, such meter reading will be deducted from the total water usage
furnished to the property as estimated by the General Manager as provided for
in this chapter.
   (C)   No facility for which a meter is installed under the provisions of
this section shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system of the town
without the owner thereof having first notified in writing the General Manager
of such proposed connection.
   (D)   The sewer staff shall have the right, at any time during regular
business hours, to check the meter reading on such meter installed to measure
the amount of water provided to the facility not discharging waste into the
town's sanitary sewers, and to remove and test such meter at any time.
   (E)   Any person making a false affidavit as to the amount of water usage
registered by a meter installed under the provisions of this section, or any
person representing to the WPCA that the facility for which a meter is
installed under the provisions hereof does not discharge waste into the
sanitary sewer when, in fact, it does, or any person having facilities for
which such a meter is installed who subsequently connects such facility to the
town's sanitary sewer system without notifying the WPCA and the General Manager
shall be guilty of an offense. Each and every day that such violation continues
shall constitute a separate offense punishable as set forth in §
51.99.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.60 ENGINEERING STUDY.
   (A)   The provisions of this section shall apply only to those industrial,
commercial and institutional water users who have facilities connected to the
sanitary sewers of the town and who make application to the General Manager
under the provisions hereof.
   (B)   Any industrial, institutional and commercial water user owning or
having control of property discharging waste into the sanitary sewers of the
town, and on whose property there is located one or more facilities requiring
water from the source of supply that also furnishes water to the sanitary sewer
system, and all or part of such water provided to any such facility is not
discharged into the sanitary sewers of the town, may make application to the
General Manager and the WPCA, on forms furnished by the WPCA, requesting that
an engineering study of the applicant's property and facilities be made for the
hereinafter stated purpose, and paying the fee established by the WPCA.
   (C)   Applications made under the provisions of this section shall be upon
forms promulgated and furnished by the General Manager with the approval of the
WPCA, and the applicant shall furnish all the information and other matters
requested therein to the WPCA. The fee for making the first application under
the provisions hereof shall be as established and revised from time to time by
the WPCA upon approval of the Legislative Council. No fee shall be required for
studies initiated by the General Manager subsequent to the first application.
The fee is to reimburse the WPCA for the expense of making the engineering
study and report. Each applicant shall agree, as a condition precedent to the
WPCA conducting the study and tests provided for herein, to indemnify and hold
harmless the WPCA of and from any and all such liability for any acts or
omissions by the WPCA, its agents and employees, committed while conducting the
engineering studies and tests provided for herein, causing or resulting in
damages to the property or person of the applicant, his or her agents,
employees and invitees.
   (D)   Upon receipt of an application and the fee required herein, the WPCA
will, as soon as possible, make an engineering study of the applicant's
property and facilities.
   In those instances where, in the opinion of the WPCA Manager based upon an
engineering study of the property and facilities of the applicant, it is
impractical or infeasible for the applicant to install one or more meters to
measure the amount of water passing through the water meter serving such
property and not being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the town, the
WPCA is authorized to make an engineering study to determine the percentage of
the amount of water passing through such meter that is being discharged into
the sanitary sewer of the town. A report of such determination, showing the
basis thereof, shall be certified by the WPCA, and one copy shall be retained
by the WPCA and one copy shall be filed with the General Manager and one copy
shall be filed with the Town Clerk. Such report, when so filed, shall
constitute the basis upon which the sewer service charge established by this
chapter shall be computed.
   (E)   The General Manager is authorized by the majority vote of the WPCA to
make such additional engineering studies from time to time of any such property
and facilities, to check the current accuracy of the filed report on any such
property, and if it is then determined that the filed reports annual estimated
sewage volume is now estimated to differ by more than 5%, a new report based
upon the latest studies shall be filed with the WPCA to replace the prior one.
A complete copy of each such report shall be retained by the WPCA, with a copy
sent to the General Manager. No change in the basis of computing the sewer
service charge for any property will be made until the first billing date after
the filing by the WPCA of the first or any subsequent report.
   (F)   In the event the General Manager, with the approval of the WPCA,
determines it is necessary that certain testing instruments be installed, or
the existing equipment of facilities located on the applicants property be
altered, adjusted, disconnected or temporarily moved in order to facilitate the
making of an engineering study or test under the provisions of this section,
all of the foregoing shall be done by and at the expense of the applicant.
   (G)   When the General Manager has, as a result of an engineering study made
under the provisions of this section, determined the percentage of metered
water passing through the water meters serving a property that is being
discharged into the sanitary sewers of the town, or when the amount of metered
water passing through the water meter serving such property and which is not
being discharged into the town's sanitary sewers is determined from a water
meter installed to measure the amount of such water, billings by the WPCA for
sanitary sewer service to such property made prior to such determination shall
be reviewed for the purpose of making whatever adjustment is necessary in order
to charge such customer only for the amount of metered water that is or has
been discharged into the town's sanitary sewers. No adjustment shall be made in
excess of that determined to be proper from such engineering study or from the
metering of water that is not discharged into the sanitary sewers of the town.
Once the proper percentage of adjustment has been determined and certified to
the WPCA under the provisions of this section, all subsequent adjustment of
water usage for sanitary sewer service charge purposes shall be computed only
on the certified basis of adjustment currently on file with the WPCA.
   (H)   The WPCA may deny an application to conduct a study authorized by this
section, for reasons including a finding by other methods adopted by the
General Manager to reflect differences in the amounts of metered potable water
and estimated wastewater discharges for the purpose of assessing user charges.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.61 SEPARATE BILLING FOR MULTI-UNIT CONNECTIONS.

living unit connections, the owner of the premises will be billed directly for
the sewer service charge, where individual water meters are not provided for
each living unit.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.62 DEDUCTIONS FOR VACANCIES; REMOVAL OF APARTMENTS FROM SERVICES.
   No deductions will be made for vacancies in the application of the minimum
sewer service charge to apartments or duplex residences in any classification.
An apartment unit or duplex unit removed from such services by remodeling or
abandonment will be relieved of payment of a sewer service charge, but
correction of the WPCA's record must be requested by the owner in writing or by
signing the proper forms provided by the WPCA.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.63 BILLING.
   (A)   Billing for sewer service charges shall be made to the sewer customers
of the WPCA by the town annually. Those persons without water meters or with a
source of water supply other than the Regional Water Authority will be billed
quarterly.
   (B)   All sewer user charges shall be due and payable on or before ten days
after the date of the mailing of the bill to the persons. Any sewer use charge
not paid within 30 days of due date shall be delinquent and shall bear interest
from the due date at the rate and in the manner provided by the General
Statutes of the State of Connecticut for delinquent property taxes. There shall
be indicated on each bill the last date on which the same may be paid without
becoming subject to the interest charge, together with a statement to the
effect that if the bill is not paid within 30 days from the due date, it will
become subject to interest from the due date at the applicable rate. The town
shall exercise due diligence to collect the full amount due. The town may
consider accounts, in its discretion, uncollectible.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.64 COLLECTION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any unpaid sewer user charges shall constitute a lien upon the real
estate against which such charge was levied from the date it became delinquent.
Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided
by the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut for continuing, recording
and releasing property tax liens and encumbrances except taxes, and may be
foreclosed in the same manner as a lien for property taxes. The WPCA, with the
approval of the Legislative Council, shall designate a person as the collector
of the sewer use charges, and such collector may collect such charges in
accordance with the provisions of the General Statutes, aforesaid, for the
collection of property taxes. The town official will prepare a list of accounts
deemed uncollectible in whole or in part with recommendations as:
      (1)   Write off as uncollectible. Said list shall be submitted to the
WPCA for review and approval.
      (2)   Delinquent unpaid sewer user charges shall be increased to include
all fees and charges applicable to the unpaid sewer use charges.
(Ord. 397, passed 10-25-99)
§ 51.65 ADJUSTMENT OF BILL.
   (A)   In the event any adjustment in a water bill affects the basis on which
the town sewer charge is levied for the same period, an appropriate adjustment
in the sewer use charge shall be made by a credit or additional charge on the
next bill. In all cases, the General Manager shall certify to the WPCA the
validity of each adjustment.
   (B)   The WPCA may permit adjustments to a user's sewer bill for various
reasons under provisions of rules, regulations and guidelines that may be
adopted from time to time by the WPCA with the approval of the Legislative
Council.

chapter, or to deposit the proper sum in the event of a dispute as to the
amount of such charges in the time and manner provided, and who continues to
discharge wastewater from his property into the sanitary sewer systems of the
town, shall be guilty of an offense. Each and every day that such violation
continues shall constitute separate offense and shall be punishable as such.
The conviction of a person for such an offense shall not be a bar to the
institution by the WPCA of a suit for the collection of the delinquent charges
and for an injunction to enjoin such person from discharging waste into the
sanitary sewer system of the town without complying with the provisions of this
subchapter and paying the charges established hereby.

(Ord. 725, passed 3-7-22)
§ 53.06 GENERAL REGULATIONS AND OPERATIONS.
   The town shall have the discretion to plant, prune, maintain and remove
trees, plants and shrubs on public property and rights-of-way, as may be
necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the health and
function of the community forest. Operational goals include:
   • maintaining canopy cover by replacing any tree removed by the town or
permitted contractors on a one-to-one basis
   • monitoring the health of the community forest through an accurate and
updated inventory of town trees
   • follow best management practices and industry standards
   (a)   Protection. As valued assets of the town, canopy cover and healthy
trees may be protected in the following ways:
      (1)   Establishing clearance limits over roadways and sidewalks to allow
for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   Taking necessary precautions to protect trees and their root zone
during maintenance procedures, such as lawn mowing and weed trimming, and
during construction activities, including sidewalk and street work, soil
grading and trenching, and compaction of soil caused by repeated vehicular
traffic within tree root zones.
   (b)   Criteria for tree removal and pruning.
      (1)   Hazardous trees. Any tree on town property that has been determined
to be a hazard may be pruned or removed by the town. Such pruning or removal
shall be undertaken at the discretion of the Tree Warden and in a manner
consistent with the Connecticut General Statutes. To be considered a hazard
tree (or limb), the Tree Warden may consider the following criteria:
         (A)   It is sufficiently large enough to cause damage or injury should
it fail;
         (B)   It has a target that would be damaged or would cause injury
should it fail;
         (C)   It has a condition that would make it likely to fail. Such
conditions may include dead or damaged condition, insect infestation, disease,
significant root damage, or other physical damage or signs of decay or distress
as noted by the Tree Warden.
         (D)   It is a risk to public health, safety or welfare.
      (2)   Infrastructure improvement. Town trees that fail to meet the
criteria of a hazardous tree may be removed as part of a bona fide
infrastructure improvement or construction project and only when all reasonable
accommodations and alterations have been considered and at the discretion of
the Tree Warden and in a manner consistent with the Connecticut General
Statutes. The town will develop plans for the installation of new plantings,
where feasible, prior to the removal of a tree or trees required for
infrastructure improvement or construction projects.
      (3)   Public safety. Town government agencies, including the Police
Department, Fire Department, and Department of Public Works, may report to the
Tree Warden any town tree that they believe constitutes a threat to public
safety - for example to motorists, pedestrians, or users of town recreational
facilities. In the event that such a tree is identified, options including
pruning, installing signage, or installing traffic signals will be evaluated.
Removal of the tree will be performed only if no other cost-effective
alternative exists. Such removal shall be undertaken at the discretion of the
Tree Warden and in a manner consistent with the Connecticut General Statutes.
      (4)   Utility maintenance. Utilities and their contractors seeking to
prune and/or remove town trees to maintain their distribution lines are
governed by Conn. Gen. Stat., § 16-234. Absent an exception enumerated in the
statute, such activity will require a permit from the Tree Warden. The Tree
Warden or a designee will review and approve the pruning or removal plan for
each tree in a manner consistent with the Connecticut General Statutes.
         (A)   Pruning: The town endorses the industry standard of directional
pruning to maintain canopy cover while accomplishing line clearance objectives.
The practice of ground to sky pruning for line maintenance is discouraged
except in select instances.
         (B)   Removal: All removals must meet the criteria of § 153.06(b)(1)
Hazardous Trees, with the exception of instances governed by state statute.
         (C)   Stump grinding: Stumps left as the result of utility maintenance
designated by the Tree Warden or other town designee as a safety hazard to
vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic shall be ground flush with surrounding
surfaces.
         (D)   Appropriate species should be retained: Small tree and shrub
varieties designated as compatible with utility distribution lines should not
be removed.
      (5)   Nuisance conditions. The Tree Warden may permit the removal of a
town tree or shrub if they determine that the tree or shrub poses a nuisance to
the community forest, as in the case of invasive species or weedy conditions.
Such decision shall be made only after posting of notice in accordance with the
Connecticut General Statutes.
   (c)   Disposal. The removal of town trees by the town will include the
removal of all debris and the grinding of stumps, within the priorities and
assigned resources of the Public Works Department.
   (d)   Prohibited criteria for removal. Unless it otherwise satisfies a
criterion for removal as defined by this chapter, a town tree will not be
removed for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   To facilitate views (including advertising signs)
      (2)   To create off-street parking
      (3)   To allow for installation of solar panels
      (4)   To reduce the extent of leaf, flower or fruit drop
      (5)   To reduce the impact from any bird or other animal waste or noise
   (e)   Tree pruning. The town shall encourage the pruning of town trees and
shrubs as an alternative to removal wherever possible. Pruning or thinning of
tree branches or limbs has several objectives including reducing risk,
improving health, developing better structure and providing clearance. Pruning,
especially of young trees, is essential to tree health, maximizing tree
benefits and minimizing future costs of tree maintenance.
   Pruning should be done according to ANSI A300, part 1 as explained in ISA
best management practices or in a management plan provided by the Tree
Commission.
   (f)   Appeals. Any person, firm or corporation aggrieved by the decision of
the Tree Warden may appeal such decision through the procedures defined by the
Connecticut General Statutes.
(Ord. 725, passed 3-7-22)
§ 53.07 PERMITS, LICENSES AND INSURANCE.
   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any individual or entity other
than the town and its agents to perform work on a tree on town owned property
or in a town right-of-way without meeting the following requirements:
   (a)   Permit. A permit is required for any entity except the town to do work
on a tree on town property or in a town right-of-way. Tree work includes but is
not limited to: removal, planting, pruning, bracing, cabling, spraying and
other remedial treatments for disease or infestation. A detailed description of
the work to be performed must be included in the permit application and
approved by the Tree Warden prior to the issuance of a permit. A permit must be
issued by the Tree Warden if all the requirements for the permit have been met.
A copy of the permit must be present on the work site and available for public
inspection. In addition, the Tree Commission shall receive a copy of all
permits prior to the work defined in the permit being performed. Only the Tree
Warden or their designee may issue permits. The entity obtaining the permit
shall abide by the standards as set forth in this chapter and policies and
specifications of the town. No individual or company will be issued a permit
without proper electrical accreditation when working within 10 feet of
electrical wires. Failure to follow the conditions of the permit and the
requirements of this chapter shall be cause for the revocation of the permit
and additional penalties as determined by the Tree Warden and defined by state
and local statutes.
   (b)    Licensed arborist. Any work performed on a town tree including
pesticide application under a permit issued by the Tree Warden must be
performed by or under the direction of a licensed arborist. All work performed
must meet current ANSI A300 standards as explained in ISA best management
practices.
   (c)   Insurance. Before any permit shall be issued, each applicant shall
first file evidence of possession of general liability insurance in the minimum
amounts of $1,000,000/$3,000,000 for bodily injury and $1,000,000/$3,000,000
property damage indemnifying the Town of Hamden and/or any person injured or
whose property was damaged resulting from the pursuit of such endeavors as
herein described. The town shall be added as an additional insured. Applicants
shall maintain workers' compensation insurance in statutory amounts.
   (d)   Debris. All debris generated as a result of the permitted work on a
public tree will be removed from the site by the contracted arborist or firm.
(Ord. 725, passed 3-7-22)
§ 53.08 TREE PLANTING.
   (a)   Planting of new trees. The town will support an ongoing tree planting
program with a goal of creating and maintaining a healthy community forest with
no net loss of town trees. Any property owner who agrees to care for a tree for
a period of at least three years may request a tree, however planting plans
will focus on streets and neighborhoods with reduced canopy cover. Subject to
the availability of funding, the number of trees planted will reflect the
number removed each year so there will be a goal of no net loss in the number
of trees. Diversity in planting will be encouraged. Tree planting on town
property shall be managed by the Public Works Department under supervision of
the Tree Warden. The Tree Warden and Tree Commission will coordinate on tree
selection and planting plans.
   (b)   List of recommended trees. The Tree Warden, in consultation with the
Tree Commission and the Planning and Zoning Department, shall maintain and
publish a list of recommended tree varieties including those appropriate for
locations with overhead wires, narrow tree lawns and other limiting factors.
(Ord. 725, passed 3-7-22)
§ 53.09 ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES.
   In accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat., § 23-59, the Tree Warden is hereby
authorized to administer and enforce this chapter on behalf of the town. The
Tree Warden shall prepare all permits, procedures, and necessary documents and
shall maintain accurate records of all activities conducted.
   Any person who violates the terms of this chapter shall be subject to a fine
in an amount of $250.
(Ord. 725, passed 3-7-22)
§ 53.10 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, paragraph, sentence or provision hereof or the application
thereof to any particular circumstances shall ever be held invalid or
unenforceable, such holding shall not affect the remainder hereof, which shall
continue in full force and effect and applicable to all circumstances to which
it may validly apply.

fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by the town.
Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to
establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any
person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten
days of the date of the first notice provided for in §
94.19 shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated town

than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the municipality.
If such person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by
default against him/her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the
applicable provisions(s) of this subchapter. The hearing officer may accept
from such person copies of police reports, investigatory and citations reports,
and other official documents by mail, and may determine thereby that the
appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the
hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he/she deems
fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall
not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or
affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his/her decision at the end of
the hearing. If he/she determines that the person is not liable, he/she shall
dismiss the matter and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. If
he/she determines that the person is liable for the violation, he/she shall
forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such
person as provided by this subchapter.
   (D)   If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing
officer shall send, by first class mail, a notice of the assessment to the

months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with
the Clerk of the Superior Court for Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West Main
Street, Meriden, CT 06450, together with the appropriate entry fee. The
certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of
assessment. Within such 12-month period, assessments against the same person
may be accrued and filed as one record of assessment. The clerk shall enter
judgment, in the amount if such record of assessment and appropriate court
costs against such person favor of the Town. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the General Statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so
entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment, and a
levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such
person.
   (E)   A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this
section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be
instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing
a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal
to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-
259, with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West
Main Street, Meriden, CT 06450, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in
accordance with the judges of the Superior Court.

amount of such charge within 30 days from the date of such notice, the
enforcement agent, within 90 days from the date of such notice, shall cause to

traffic and create a traffic hazard, or when construction is performed upon any
part of town or state roadways, when deemed a hazard by the Chief of Police or
his/her designee, due to the effect on traffic patterns and flow at the time of
the work, for the purpose of traffic control and public safety. Such officer(s)

Section 570.304 in order to accept the recipient's prior civil rights
certification, the recipient has failed to meet any such assurance.
§ 99.04 REVIEW FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.
   CFR Section 570.601(d) sets forth the general requirements for title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 570.602 sets forth the general requirements
for Section 109 of the act. Together these provisions prohibit discrimination
in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available
under this part.
   (A)   Review for equal employment opportunity. The Department will presume
that a recipient's hiring and employment practices have been carried out in
compliance with its equal opportunity certifications and requirements of the
act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of
circumstances, there has been a deprivation of employment, promotion, or
training opportunities by a recipient to any person within the meaning of
Section 109 of the act. The event to which persons of a particular race, gender
or ethnic background are represented in the workforce may in certain
circumstances be considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and
other information.
   (B)   Review of equal opportunity in services, benefits and participation.
The Department will presume a recipient is carrying out its programs and
activities in accordance with the civil rights certifications and requirements
of the act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of
circum stances, there has been a deprivation of services, benefits, or
participation in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with block
grant funds by a recipient to any person within the meaning of Section 109 of
the act. The extent of which persons of a particular race, gender, or ethnic
background participate in a program or activity may in certain circumstances be
considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and other
information.

§ 99.05 FAIR HOUSING REVIEW CRITERIA.
   Section 570.601(b) sets the general requirements for Title VIII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1968 and the grantee's certification that it will affirmatively
further fair housing. In reviewing a recipient's actions in carrying out its
housing and community development activities in a manner to affirmatively
further fair housing in the private and public housing sectors, absent
independent evidence to the contrary, the Department will consider that a
recipient has taken such actions in accordance with its certification if the
recipient meets the following review criteria:
   (A)   The recipient has conducted an analysis to determine the impediments
to fair housing choice in its housing and community development program and
activities. The term "FAIR HOUSING CHOICE" means the ability of persons,
regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, of similar income
levels to have available to them the same housing choices. This analysis shall
include a review for impediments to fair housing choice in the following areas:
      (1)   The sale or rental of dwellings;
      (2)   The provision of housing brokerage services;
      (3)   The provision of financing assistance for dwellings;
      (4)   Public policies and actions affecting the approval of sites and
other building requirements used in the approval process for the construction
of publicly assisted housing;
      (5)   The administrative policies concerning community development and
housing activities, such as urban homesteading, multi-family rehabilitation,
and activities causing displacement, which affect opportunities of minority
households to select housing inside or outside areas of minority concentration;
and
      (6)   Where there is a determination of unlawful segregation or other
housing discrimination by a court or a finding of noncompliance by HUD
regarding assisted housing within a recipient's jurisdiction, an analysis of
the actions which could be taken by the recipient to help remedy the
discriminatory condition, including actions involving the expenditure of funds
made available under this part.
   (B)   Based upon the conclusions of the analysis in division (A) above, the
recipient has taken lawful steps, consistent with this part, relating to
housing and community development to overcome the effects of conditions that
limit fair housing choice within the recipient's jurisdiction. Such actions may
include:
      (1)   Enactment and enforcement of an ordinance providing for fair
housing consistent with the federal fair housing law;
      (2)   Support of the administration and enforcement of state fair housing
laws providing for fair housing consistent with federal fair housing law;
      (3)   Participation in voluntary partnerships developed with public and
private organizations to promote the achievement of the goal of fair housing
choice (including implementation of a locally developed and HUD-approved New
Horizons comprehensive fair housing plan);
      (4)   Contracting with private organizations, including private fair
housing organizations, where such support will bring about actions consistent
with Titles VI and VIII, to address the impediments identified in the analysis
described in division (A) above;
      (5)   Activities which assist in remedying findings or determinations of
unlawful segregation or other discrimination involving assisted housing within
the recipient's jurisdiction; or
      (6)   Other actions consistent with law determined to be appropriate
based upon the conclusions of the analysis.
(Ord. 292, passed 5-1-89)
§ 99.06 ACTIONS TO USE MINORITY AND WOMEN'S BUSINESS FIRMS.
   The Department will review a recipient's performance to determine if it has
administered its activities funded with assistance under this part in a manner
to encourage use of minority and women's business enterprises described in
Executive Orders 11625, 12432, and 12138, and 24 CFR 85.36(e). In making this
review, the Department will determine if the grantee has taken actions required
under 24 CFR 85.36(e), and will review the effectiveness of those actions in
accomplishing the objectives of 24 CFR 85.36(e) and the Executive Orders. No
recipient; is required by this section to attain or maintain any particular
statistical level of participation in its contractor's activities by race,
ethnicity, or gender of the contractor's owners or managers.

expected to respond. This includes, but shall not be limited to, all burglar
alarms, fire alarms, hold-up alarms, medical alarms and automatic telephone
dialing devices. This does not include any alarm systems or smoke detectors
which do not signal outside an alarmed premise or an alarm system on motor
vehicles.

entry into the area protected by the system.
   "CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS CENTER." The police and fire communications area,
other facilities which have communications equipment and the Police/Fire

willfully or by inadvertence, negligence, or an unintentional act, including
the malfunction of the alarm system to which the Police Department and/or the

Central Communications Center receiving equipment if the alarm is directly
connected to the alarm board; testing or repairing of telephone or electrical
lines or equipment outside the protected premises; acts of God, such as

the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If the
person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default
against him/her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the
applicable provision(s) of this chapter. The hearing officer may accept from
the person copies of police reports, investigatory and citations reports, and
other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance
of the person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in
the order and form and with such methods of proof, as he/she deems fair and
appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
The hearing officer shall announce his/her decision at the end of the hearing.
If he/she determines that the person is not liable, he/she shall dismiss the
matter and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. If he/she
determines that the person is liable for the violation, he/she shall forthwith
enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person as
provided by this chapter.
   (D)   If the assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing

of the Superior Court for Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West Main Street,
Meriden, CT 06450, together with the appropriate entry fee. The certified copy
of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within the
12-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed
as one record of assessment.
   The clerk shall enter judgment in the amount of the record of assessment and
appropriate court costs against the person in favor of the town.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Statutes, the hearing
officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a
civil money judgment and a levy of execution on the judgment may issue without
further notice to the person.
   (E)   A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this
section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be
instituted within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of the assessment by
filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount
equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., §
52-259, with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West

of a partially completed or unfulfilled public-fund transaction, upon notation

files of the town, but waiver of the cancellation or termination shall not

§ 123.06 DELINQUENT TAX ISSUES.
With the exception of a site identified as environmentally impacted pursuant to

these taxes with the tax collector. If a business receiving incentives becomes
delinquent at any time during the incentive period and does not make an
acceptable repayment arrangement with the tax collector, the incentive program
shall cease and that business shall be liable for paying all taxes deferred or
abated to the date of delinquency.

§ 123.08 REAL PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVES.
   (A)   (Conn. Gen. Stat., § 12-65b). Subsequent to an affirmative vote of the
Legislative Council, the town (through the Mayor) may enter into a written
agreement with any party owning or proposing to acquire an interest in real
property in the Town of Hamden, or with any party owning or proposing to
acquire an interest in air space in the town, or with any party who is the
lessee of, or who proposes to be the lessee of, air space in the town in such a
manner that the air space leased or proposed to be leased shall be assessed to
the lessee pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 12-64, subject to the provisions set
forth below.
   (B)   The provisions of division (A) above shall only apply if the
improvements are for at least one of the following: 1) office use; 2) retain
use; 3) permanent residential use; 4) transient residential use; 5)
manufacturing; 6) warehouse, storage or distribution use; 7) structured multi-
leveled parking use necessary in connection with a mass transit system; 8)
information technology; 9) recreational facilities; or 10) transportation
facilities.
   (C)   Based on the cost of improvements, the Assessor shall determine the
net increase in assessed value. The increased value shall be the basis of the
amount of the deferral.
   (D)   Payback period. If the owner or lessee receiving the incentive
substantially reduces its operations on its real property, attempts to assign
its rights under this agreement, or sells or otherwise transfers the real
estate during the relevant payback period noted above, the town may terminate
the incentive program and may require full pay back of all deferred taxes. In
order to maintain eligibility the town may require property owners or lessees
to submit eligibility affidavits annually.
   (E)   Any tax agreement entered into pursuant to this policy shall be
recorded in the Hamden land records and shall constitute a priority lien
against the property benefited until the conditions of the tax abatement have
been fulfilled and the agreement has expired. Upon default under the terms of
the agreement, or material misrepresentation in the application, the taxes
abated shall immediately become due and payable, with interest as provided by
law, and may be liened; and the lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as
provided by law for tax property liens generally.
   (F)   Effective date for deferrals. Assessment deferrals on real property
made under this section shall commence on the October 1 Grand List following

PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
§ 154.10 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   In order to prohibit and abate within the municipality nuisances and causes
thereof, as defined in §
154.11, it is declared that all structures, including but not limited to one
and two-family and multiple-family dwellings, whether or not used for
residential purposes, garden apartments, and all other apartment complexes,
condominiums, vacant lots, all shopping centers, supermarkets, retail stores,
discount houses, warehouses, manufacturing or fabrication plants, factories,
gasoline service stations, public garages, motor vehicle repair shops or other
business uses, and accessory structures to all of the foregoing, whether
occupied or vacant, shall be maintained in conformity with the standards set
out in §
154.10 through
154.15, so as to assure that none of these structures or properties will
adversely affect their neighborhood or the larger community. It is found and
declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration,
certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighting
conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and
removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in
time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same. By reason of timely regulations and restrictions, as herein
contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood
and property values thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of
residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods enhanced and the public
health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

around doors, windows, chimneys and other parts of a building shall be so

evidences of dry rot or other deterioration shall be repaired or replaced and
refinished in a workmanlike manner. Exterior walls, roofs and other parts of
the building shall be free from loose and unsecured objects and material. Such
objects or materials shall be removed, repaired or replaced.

§ 154.17 APPEAL; HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Mayor shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers, other

requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fine(s) admitted to, in person
or by mail to an official designated by the town. Such payment shall be
inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of
such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver
or mail written demand for a hearing within ten days of the date of the first
notice provided for in §
154.15 shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated town
official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer.
The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties,
costs or fees provided for herein and shall follow the procedures set forth in
§

may present evidence in his/her behalf. A designated municipal official, other
than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the municipality.
If such person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by
default against him/her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the
applicable provisions(s) of this subchapter. The hearing officer may accept
from such person copies of police reports, investigatory and citations reports,
and other official documents by mail, and may determine thereby that the
appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the
hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he/she deems
fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall
not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or
affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his/her decision at the end of
the hearing. If he/she determines that the person is not liable, he/she shall
dismiss the matter and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. If
he/she determines that the person is liable for the violation, he/she shall
forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such
person as provided by this subchapter.
   (D)   If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing
officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person
found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months
after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the Clerk
of the Superior Court for Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West Main Street,
Meriden, CT 06450, together with the appropriate entry fee. The certified copy
of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within
such 12-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and
filed as one record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment if the amount
of such record of assessment and appropriate court costs against such person
favor of the town. Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Statutes,
the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the
effect of a civil money judgment, and a levy of execution on such judgment may
issue without further notice to such person.
   (E)   A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this
section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be
instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing
a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal
to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-
259, with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Geographical Area No. 7, 54 West

of this section, notice shall be presumed to have been properly sent if it was
mailed to the owner's last-known address on file with the Tax Collector.
If the owner to whom such notice is issued is a registrant, the municipality
may deliver such notice in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat., § 7-148ii,
provided nothing in this section shall preclude the town from providing notice
in another manner permitted by applicable law.
   (C)   Admission of liability.
      (1)   Payment of fines. If the owner who or which is sent notice pursuant
to division (B) of this section wishes to admit liability for any alleged
violation, they may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the
fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official
designated by such municipality. The payment shall be inadmissible in any
proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of the owner making the
payment.
      (2)   Failure to demand appeal hearing. Any owner who does not deliver or
mail written demand for a hearing within ten days of the date of the first
notice provided for in division (B) of this section shall be deemed to have
admitted liability, and the designated municipal official shall certify the
owner's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall
thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by
the applicable ordinances and shall follow the procedures set forth in division
(E) of this section.

shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing.

hearing officer shall grant, upon good cause shown, any reasonable request by
any interested party for postponement or continuance.
      (2)   Initial notice of violation deemed a business record. An original
or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the issuing
official or police officer shall be filed and retained by the town, and shall
be deemed to be a business record within the scope of Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-
180 and evidence of the facts contained therein.
      (3)   Presence of issuing official. The presence of the issuing official
or police officer shall be required at the hearing if so requested by the
owner.
      (4)   Presentation of evidence. An owner wishing to contest their
liability shall appear ar the hearing and may present evidence on their behalf.
A designated municipal official, other than the hearing officer, may present
evidence on behalf of the municipality.
      (5)   Failure to appear. If the owner fails to appear, the hearing
officer may enter an assessment by default against the owner upon a finding of
proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The
hearing officer may accept from the owner copies of police reports,
investigatory and citation reports, and other official documents by mail, and
may determine thereby that the appearance of the owner is unnecessary.
      (6)   Conduct of the hearing. The hearing officer shall conduct the
hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as they deem fair
and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
      (7)   Decision by the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall announce
their decision at the end of the hearing. If they determine that the owner is
not liable, they shall dismiss the matter and enter their determination in
writing accordingly. If they determine that the owner is liable for the
violation, they shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or
fees against the owner as provided by the applicable ordinance of the town.
   (E)   If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing
officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the owner
found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days or more than 12 months after
such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of a
superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator, together
with an entry fee. The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall
constitute a record of assessment. Within such 12-month period, assessments
against the same owner may be accrued and filed as one record of assessment.
The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and
court costs, against the owner in favor of the municipality. Notwithstanding
any provision of the General Statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when
so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment, and
a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to the
owner.
   (F)   An owner against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this
section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be
instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing
a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal
to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-
259, at a superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator,
which shall entitle the owner or person to a hearing in accordance with the
rules of the judges of the Superior Court.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 FINDINGS.
   The Special Flood Hazard Areas of the town, as identified on the federal
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which
increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage
uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 155.03 PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission is hereby appointed to administer and
implement this chapter by approving and applying flood regulations as mandated
by FEMA, within the zoning regulations.
(Ord. 598, passed 12-6-10)
§ 155.04 DUTIES OF PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION.
   Duties of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall include, but not be
limited to the following.
   (A)   Permit review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area of
special flood hazard.
      (4)   For purposes of this section, "ADVERSELY AFFECTS" means that the
cumulative effects of proposed development when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development increases the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (B)   Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with the Flood Insurance Study, the planning and
zoning commission shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in
order to administer the requirements of residential and non-residential
construction standards.
   (C)   Information to be obtained and maintained.
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest habitable floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures.
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved structures, verify and record
the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level).
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Alteration of watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and department of environmental
protection, State of Connecticut, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of the notification to FEMA.
      (2)   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
   (E)   Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual filed conditions). The person contesting the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in § 155.05.
(Ord. 598, passed 12-6-10)
§ 155.05 ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the town shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances of the flood regulations contained in the

when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Planning and Zoning Commission in the enforcement or
administration of the flood regulations contained in the zoning regulations.

written notice to any person who violates any provision of any section of the
town's zoning regulations. Such written notice shall explain the nature of the
violation and the steps required for compliance, and shall allow a 72-hour
period within which to correct the violation or within which a written plan for
correction shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer setting forth a
reasonable time period for correction of the violation as agreed upon by the
zoning enforcement officer. A written notice issued by the zoning enforcement

re-inspect the subject property to determine compliance.
   (C)   If the violations set forth in the written notice have not been
corrected at the time of re-inspection, the zoning enforcement officer or his
or her agent may issue a citation and fine for each violation. All citations
issued by the zoning enforcement officer or his or her agent shall state the
violation for which the citation is being issued, the fine imposed for the
violation, the time period within which the fine must be paid, and an address
for remittance of the fine. The fine for each violation shall be $150 for each
day that such violation continues. Citations shall be issued by the zoning
enforcement officer or his or her agent by hand, or by delivery to the abode or
residence of the person in violation.
(Ord. 509, passed 2-7-05)
§ 156.02 COMPLIANCE PERIODS AFTER CITATION IS ISSUED.
   Upon the issuance of a citation by the zoning enforcement officer or his or
her agent, the time period for correction of the violation cited in such
citation shall be in accordance with the following requirements:
   (A)   For violations that involve the illegal use of a property by a non-
structural object such as a sign, vehicle, junk and the like, compliance with
the regulations shall be within 48 hours of issuance of the citation.
   (B)   For violations that involve the illegal use of a property by the
conduct of an activity, which is not permitted, compliance with the regulations
shall be within 48 hours of issuance of the citation.
   (C)   For violations that involve the illegal placement of a structure, all
work on the structure shall immediately cease. Further, all violations not
included in divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall be brought in
compliance with the zoning regulations within 48 hours of the issuance of the
citation, or within such other time period as designated in writing by the
zoning enforcement officer or his or her agent.
   (D)   Any violation for which a citation is issued and which is not
corrected within the time period allowed in this section, shall be a new
violation of the zoning regulations, and every 24-hour period thereafter in
which the violation is not corrected shall constitute a new violation. For
repeated violations of the same section of the zoning regulations by the same
person, the zoning enforcement officer shall not be required to provide the
violator with another written notice or correction period, and may immediately
issue the citations and fines permitted by this chapter.
   (E)   The zoning enforcement officer shall not be responsible for a daily
re-inspection; rather the person to whom the citation has been issued shall be
responsible for reporting subsequent compliance to the zoning enforcement
officer or his or her agent. The zoning enforcement officer, or his or her
agent, shall re-inspect to confirm compliance within 24 hours of such report.
(Ord. 509, passed 2-7-05)
§ 156.03 PAYMENT OF FINES.
   (A)   All fines imposed under this chapter shall be made payable to the
Treasurer of the town and shall be received by the zoning enforcement officer
or his or her agent within ten business days from receipt of the citation. All
fines collected by the zoning enforcement officer shall be directed to the Town
Treasurer.
   (B)   No zoning permit shall be approved by the Planning Department until
the applicant provides the Planning Department with a statement, in writing,
that there are no delinquent fines or fees due for the property for which an
application is made or provides a statement in writing, from the Town Planner
or his or her agent that the owner of the property for which an application is
made has entered into a payment program approved by the Finance Director to pay
off any delinquent fines or penalties.
   (C)   The Town Planner may authorize the issuance of a zoning permit without
the satisfaction of the above if he or she certifies in writing, as part of the
file, that an emergency exists affecting the health or safety of the occupants
of the building upon which property the zoning application is sought.
(Ord. 509, passed 2-7-05; Am. Ord. 542, passed 9-5-06)
§ 156.04 HEARING PROCEDURE FOR A CITATION.
   (A)   Appointment of citation hearing officer. The Mayor, acting within his
or her capacity of chief executive officer, shall appoint one or more citation
hearing officers, other than police officers or employees or persons who issue
citations, to conduct the hearing authorized by this section. Further, no
zoning enforcement officer, building inspector or employee of the municipal
body exercising zoning authority may be appointed to be a hearing officer for
citations issued for zoning violations.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   At any time within 12 months from the expiration of the final
period for the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any
citation issued under this ordinance adopted pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., § 8-
12a, as amended, for an alleged violation thereof, an official of the town
shall send notice to the person cited. Such notice shall inform the person
cited:
         (a)   Of the allegations against him or her and the amount of the
fines, penalties, costs or fees due;
         (b)   That he or she may contest his or her liability before a
citation hearing officer by delivering in person or by mail written notice
within ten days of the date thereof;
         (c)   That if he or she does not demand such a hearing, an assessment
and judgment shall be entered against him or her; and
         (d)   That such judgment may issue without further notice.
      (2)   If the person who is sent notice pursuant to division (A) of this
section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he or she may,
without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties,
costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by the
town. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal,
to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any
person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten
days of the date of the first notice provided for in division (A) of this
section shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated
municipal official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the
hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines
provided for within this article and shall follow the procedures set forth in
division (B)(4) of this section.
      (3)   Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of
the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less
than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the mailing of notice of
hearing, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any
reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An
original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the
issuing official or police officer shall be filed and retained by the
municipality, and shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of
Conn. Gen. Stat., § 52-180 and evidence of the facts contained therein. The
presence of the issuing official or police officer shall be required at the
hearing if such person so requests. A person wishing to contest his or her
liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his or her
behalf. A designated municipal official, other than the hearing officer, may
present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If such person fails to appear,
the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him or her upon
a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes,
ordinances or zoning regulations. The hearing officer may accept from such
person copies of police reports, investigatory and citation reports, and other
official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of
such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in
the order and form and with such methods of proof, as he or she deems fair and
appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end of the
hearing. If he or she determines that the person is not liable, he or she shall
dismiss the matter and enter his or her determination in writing accordingly.
If he or she determines that the person is liable for the violation, he or she
shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against
such person as provided by the applicable town ordinances.
      (4)   If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the
hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to
the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12
months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with
the clerk of the superior court for the geographical area in which the town is
located together with an entry fee of $8. The certified copy of the notice of
assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such 12-month
period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one
record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such
record of assessment and court costs of $8, against such person in favor of the
municipality. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Connecticut General
Statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment,
shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such
judgment may issue without further notice to such person.
      (5)   A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to
this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall
be instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by
filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount
equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat., §
52-259, in the superior court for the geographical area in which the town is
located, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the
rules of the judges of the superior court.
(Ord. 509, passed 2-7-05)
§ 156.05 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The penalties established by this chapter shall not be exclusive of

regulations.
