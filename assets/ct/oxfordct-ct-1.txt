   The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to establish a tax relief
program in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-129n, as amended, to assist
elderly or totally and permanently disabled residents of the town with their
real property taxes. Eligible participants will receive a tax abatement applied
against their principal residence, in addition to the abatement provided under

which the lot is located.
   (C)   The total of all tax relief granted under the provisions of this tax
relief program shall, in any fiscal year, not exceed $100,000 of the total real
estate property tax assessment in the town in the preceding fiscal year. In the
event the total calculated tax relief would exceed the above limitations, the
individual abatements shall be reduced on a pro rata basis.
(Ord. passed 2-13-2006)
§ 37.072 ELIGIBILITY.
   Any person who owns real property in the town or who is liable for the
payment of taxes thereon under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-48 and who occupies that
property as his or her principal residence, shall be eligible for real property
tax relief pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-129n in the form of a tax credit
provided that all the following conditions are met.
   (A)   The person is:
      (1)   Sixty five years of age or over at the close of the calendar year
preceding the period in which a claim for relief is filed; or whose spouse
living with him or her is 65 years of age or over at the close of the calendar
year preceding the period in which a claim for relief is filed; or the person
is 60
years of age or over and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified in the
town under this subchapter at the time of his or her death or with respect to
real property on which the applicant or his or her spouse is liable for taxes

      (2)   Under age 65 years of age and eligible in accordance with
applicable federal regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits
under Social Security, or has not been engaged in employment covered by Social
Security and accordingly has not qualified for benefits thereunder, but has
become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal,
state or local government retirement disability plan, including the Railroad
Retirement Act and any government-related teacher’s retirement plan, in which
requirements with respect to qualifications for permanent total disability
benefits are comparable to the requirements under Social Security.
   (B)   The applicant and/or his or her spouse under divisions (A)(1) or (A)
(2) above must have been a real property taxpayer of the town for three years
immediately preceding their receipt of tax benefits under this subchapter and
meet the requirements with respect to maximum income allowance during the
calendar year preceding the year in which the application is made for the tax
credit provided in this subchapter.

tax relief provided by the state. If the applicant is denied eligibility for
tax relief granted under one or more of the State Circuit Breaker programs, the
Assessor shall deny the applicant the local share of tax relief, remove the
applicant from the abatement records and bill him or her for the full real
estate tax due; provided, however, that an unmarried applicant with an income
between $27,701 and $36,900 and a married applicant with an income between
$33,901 and $36,900 shall not be required to supply for or be granted State

the Assessor, in substantiation of his or her application, a copy of his or her
federal income tax return for the calendar year immediately preceding the year
of application, or, if not required to file a return, other evidence of
qualifying income which the Assessor may reasonably require to establish
compliance with the income qualifications provided in this subchapter. The
applicant, or his or her authorized agent, shall sign a sworn affidavit
affirming the accuracy of the statements in the application. Any falsifications
of information required in any application shall result in a denial and/or
revocation of tax relief with respect to the applicant and/or repayment and
recapture by the town of any and all tax relief granted the applicant pursuant
to this program, in addition to any penalties provided for by the Connecticut
General Statutes, a taxpayer who fraudulently obtains tax benefits under this
program shall be liable for repayment of the abated taxes, interest and any
cost of collecting same, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.
   (B)   When the Assessor has determined that the applying taxpayer is
entitled to tax relief under this program, he or she shall compute the amount
of the tax relief and cause a tax credit to be issued in a form as to permit
the Tax Collector to reduce the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer and
make proper record thereof. A copy thereof shall be delivered to the applicant.
   (C)   In any case where title to real property is recorded in the name of a
taxpayer or in the name of his or her spouse, who is eligible for tax relief
hereunder, and in the name of any other person or persons, the tax relief
hereunder shall be prorated to allow a tax credit equivalent to the fractional
share in the property of the taxpayer or spouse; and the persons not otherwise
eligible for tax relief shall not receive any tax credit. Furthermore, if the
property is a multiple-family dwelling, the relief shall be prorated to reflect
the fractional portion of the property occupied by the qualified applicant or
his or her qualified surviving spouse.
   (D)   The tax relief granted under this program shall, in each case, be for
a term to correspond with the State Circuit Breaker program. A complete and
timely application, as specified in division (A) above, shall be required for
each subsequent period of tax relief under this program.
   (E)   In the event the real property of a qualified applicant is sold,
assigned, granted or conveyed during the fiscal year when a credit is
applicable, regardless of whether the transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance
was voluntary or involuntary, the amount of the tax credit shall be prorated by
the office of the Town Assessor.
   (F)   The Assessor and Tax Collector shall provide forms and institute
procedures as may be required for the Circuit Breaker program and shall modify
the form as may be necessary to implement this tax relief program.
   (G)   All applications for this program, any federal income tax returns or
other personal financial documentation filed therewith, and any additional
evidence of qualifying income that the Assessor may require to determine
eligibility for this program shall be kept confidential and not open to public
inspection; provided, however, that the Tax Collector, Board of Finance and
Board of Selectmen shall be allowed access to any information as may be
required in their official capacity.
   (H)   In determining the primary residency eligibility of the applicant, the
Assessor may utilize and rely on the authenticity of the following:

§ 52.01 PURPOSE, INTENT AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the town through the regulation of non-
stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
   (B)   This stormwater management chapter provides the minimum content for
implementing and enforcing the state’s stormwater management program consistent
with the Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 7-148(c)(8)(A)l, 8-2(a)2, 8-253, 22a-36 to 22a-454
inclusive and 8-2(b)5. This chapter provides guidance to establish minimum
criteria for municipal code development. While all local development review and
approval processes are unique, this document helps ensure that all stormwater
management regulations contain the minimum requirements for effective program
implementation.
   (C)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user;
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system; and
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter.

Commission, its agent(s) and the Town Engineer and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing the access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the access to a permitted facility
is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person
who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial, commercial or construction activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Town Planning and Zoning Commission, its agent(s) and the
Town Engineer has been refused access to any part of the premises from which
stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at
his or her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial or commercial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) or stormwater management plan (SMP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. passed 7-14-2008)

§ 92.01 LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to state with emphasis the
right to farm, which reads as follows:
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 19a-341. Agricultural or farming operation not deemed a
nuisance; exceptions. Spring or well water collection operation not deemed a
nuisance.
(a)   Notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or regulation
pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no agricultural or farming operation,
place, establishment or facility, or any of its appurtenances, or the operation
thereof; shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public or private,
due to alleged objectionable (1) odor from livestock, manure, fertilizer or
feed, (2) noise from livestock or farm equipment used in normal, generally
acceptable farming procedures, (3) dust created during plowing or cultivation
operations, (4) use of chemicals, provided such chemicals and the method of
their application conform to practices approved by the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection or, where applicable, the Commissioner of Public
Health, or (5) water pollution from livestock or crop production activities,
except the pollution of public or private drinking water supplies, provided
such activities conform to acceptable management practices for pollution
control approved by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection; provided such
agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility has been in
operation for one year or more and has not been substantially changed, and such
operation follows generally accepted agricultural practices. Inspection and
approval of Commissioner of Agriculture or his designee shall be prima facie
evidence that such operation follows generally accepted agricultural practices.
(b)   Notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or regulation
pertaining to nuisances, no operation to collect spring water or well water, as
defined in § 2la-150, shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public
or private, due to alleged objectionable noise from equipment used in such
operation provided the operation (1) conforms to generally accepted practices
for the collection of spring water or well water, (2) has received all
approvals or permits required by law, and (3) complies with the local zoning
authority’s time, place and manner restrictions on operations to collect spring
water or well water.
(c)   The provisions of this section shall not apply whenever a nuisance
results from negligence or willful or reckless misconduct in the operation of
any such agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility,
or any of its appurtenances. This right shall be accorded to all citizens of
the State under § 19a-341 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and all state
statutes and regulations there under, specifically outlined in, but not
restricted to, the Definition of Agriculture, Connecticut General Statute § 1-
lq which states:
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-1. Except as otherwise specifically defined, the words
“agriculture” and “farming” shall include cultivation of the soil, dairying,
forestry, raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity,
including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training and management
of livestock, including horses, bees, poultry, fur-bearing animals and
wildlife, and the raising or harvesting of oysters, clams, mussels, other
molluscan shellfish or fish; the operation, management, conservation,
improvement or maintenance of a farm and its buildings, tools and equipment, or
salvaging timber or cleared land of brush or other debris left by a storm, as
an incident to such farming operations; the production or harvesting of maple
syrup or maple sugar, or any agricultural commodity, including lumber, as an
incident to ordinary farming operations or the harvesting of mushrooms, the
hatching of poultry, or the construction, operation or maintenance of ditches,
canals, reservoirs or waterways used exclusively for farming purposes;
handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading,
storing or delivering to storage or to market, or to a carrier for
transportation to market, or for direct sale any agricultural or horticultural
commodity as an incident to ordinary farming operations, or, in the case of
fruits and vegetables, as an incident to the preparation of such fruits or
vegetables for market or for direct sale. The term “farm” includes farm
buildings, and accessory buildings thereto, nurseries, orchards, ranges,
greenhouses, hoophouses and other temporary structures or other structures used
primarily for the raising and, as an incident to ordinary farming operations,
the sale of agricultural or horticultural commodities. The term “aquaculture”
means the farming of the waters of the state and tidal wetlands and the
production of protein food, including fish, oysters, clams, mussels and other
molluscan shellfish, on leased, franchised and public underwater farm lands.
Nothing herein shall restrict the power of a local zoning authority under
Chapter 124.
   (B)   This chapter encourages the pursuit of agriculture, whether commercial
or noncommercial, promotes agriculture-based economic opportunities and
protects farmland within the town by allowing agricultural uses and related
activities to function with minimal conflict with abutters and town agencies.
Its intent is to promote a good neighbor policy between agriculturalists and
residents by advising purchasers and residents of property adjacent to or near
existing and future agricultural operations of the inherent potential
activities associated with the purchase or residence including, but not limited
to, the sounds, odors, dust and chemicals that may accompany agricultural
activates, so that purchasers and residents will understand and be prepared to
accept aforementioned occurrences. In addition, this chapter shall be effective
regardless of whether disclosure was made.

§ 97.01 POLICY.
   The town has approximately 120 miles of local roadway that it maintains and
plows. Additionally, the State CTDOT plows Routes 67, 34, 188 and 42. Due to
the high costs of removing snow, it is important for the Department of Public
Works to use its resources wisely with cooperation from the residents to
minimize the cost.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009)
§ 97.02 PLOW ROUTES.
   The roadways are plowed and sanded in order of priority. Main (collector)
roads are addressed first with special attention to steep hills and difficult
intersections. Every effort will be made to keep roads open and safe.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009)
§ 97.03 BLOCKED DRIVEWAYS.
   All snow plows angle the same way (to the driver’s right) and when going by
they will push the snow in front of a driveway. The homeowner is responsible
for access to his or her driveway. The only way to avoid extra shoveling is to
wait until the Department of Public Works crew have done its final clean up on
the road.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009)
§ 97.04 MAILBOX DAMAGE.
   The town does not repair or replace mailboxes and/or posts that crack or
break from the force of plowed snow or because they were improperly installed.
Mailboxes and supporting posts must be installed to withstand the rigors of
snow removal, including the force of snow pushed from the street onto the
roadside. Mailboxes should be 15 inches away from the edge of the road and 42
inches high to the bottom of the mailbox. The town will repair or replace
mailboxes and/or posts that are actually struck by a plow blade or truck.
Usually a paint mark or truck tire tracks supply evidence of a mailbox strike.
A standard four by four post and standard mailbox will be installed.

(Ord. passed 11-9-2009)
§ 97.05 BASKETBALL HOOPS.
   It is illegal to install a basketball hoop in the town right-of-way. The
town does not repair or replace basketball hoops that are illegally installed
in this area and damaged from plowing operations. Portable basketball hoops
should be moved out of harm’s way.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.06 PRIVATE PLOWING.
   The town prohibits plow contractors or homeowners from pushing snow/ice from
the driveways or parking lots onto town roads. This practice is dangerous and
impedes the town’s snow removal efforts. If there is no other alternative to
pushing snow/ice into the road, the plow driver must plow off the snow piles
(windrows) left across the road by re-plowing until the road is safe. This may
not necessarily mean bare pavement, but certainly it should be no worse than
when the driver began work.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.07 PARKED VEHICLES.
   It is a safety hazard to residents and plow drivers when vehicles are parked
in the road. Not only do parked vehicles reduce the sightline for pedestrians
and oncoming vehicles but also they force the plows to veer out of the travel
lane. Vehicles should be removed from the roadway prior to snow/ice event. Cars
may be towed if left to obstruct plowing between December 1 and March 31, per
town ordinance.
(Ord. passed 11-9-2009) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Fines for basketball hoops and similar recreational items.
      (1)   No resident shall construct, erect or place or allow to be
constructed, erected or placed on real property which the town owns or has a
right-of-way to use, a basketball hoop or similar recreational item.
      (2)   Within seven days of receipt of a notice from the town that a
basketball hoop or similar recreational item must be totally removed, the
recipient of the notice shall remove the hoop or item.
      (3)   If the recipient does not remove the basketball hoop or similar
recreational item, the town or its duly authorized agent shall effectuate
removal and disposal of the hoop or item.
   (B)   Fines for windrows. Any party contractor or homeowner within one hour
of having caused windrows to build up in a public street shall remove the
windrows as completely as possible. Any party having failed to effectuate
timely removal shall be fined $50.
   (C)   Fines for parkings. Any operator and/or owner who does not comply with
the town parking ban during a snow/ice event shall be fined $50 for each motor
vehicle left parked in a town public road.
   (D)   Complaints. Residents who have questions or feel they have a
legitimate complaint should call the Department of Public Works at (203)888-
7716.

subchapter were required. The Driveway Enforcement Officer and the Town
Engineer shall provide the Board of Selectmen with an advisory report for each
variance request.
   (D)   A driveway permit shall be issued for the sole purpose of securing
access to, and parking on, a particular piece of property. In no case shall a

CHAPTER 130: LOITERING
Section
   
130.01   Loitering
§ 130.01 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 152.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   In Conn. Gen. Stat. § 7-148(c)(7), the Legislature of the state delegates to
local governmental units the responsibility of adopting regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the town meeting does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer line, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
and
   (G)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in
a flood hazard area.

coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions. Non-supporting breakaway wall, lattice work or mesh screening
may be allowed below the base flood elevation provided it is not part of the
structural support of the building and is designed so as to breakaway, under
abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural
integrity of the building on which it is to be used and provided the following
design specifications are met:
         (a)   Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not be less
than ten nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
         (b)   If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse
would result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base
flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement or other structural
damage due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading
values to be used in this determination shall each have 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).
   (B)   Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited
below the base flood elevations.

(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.081 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.031 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and
potential projectiles and have erosion potential, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall
be permitted unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.082 COMPENSATORY STORAGE.
   The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are
tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new
construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to
the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the
floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been
gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be
hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of
floodwater at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation,
which would be displaced by the proposed project. Compensatory storage can be
provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.083 EQUAL CONVEYANCE.
   Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as
designated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for the community,
encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial
improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are
prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered
professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels
(base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the
floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage, shall not be
constructed in a way so as to cause an increase in flood storage or flood
velocity.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
§ 152.095 REQUIREMENTS.
   In all special flood hazard areas the following requirements shall apply:
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;

(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.112 CONSIDERATIONS FOR GRANTING OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   In passing upon applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and as follows:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case
of a functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (B)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)
§ 152.113 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of
the building.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (C)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lower floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage.
   (D)   The Town Planning and Zoning Commission shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in its biennial report.
(Ord. passed 4-11-1991; Ord. passed 5-10-2010)

not limited to, the number of members, terms, method of selection and removal
of members and filling of vacancies.
   (C)   At least one member of the Agency or staff of the Agency shall
complete the course in technical training formulated by the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection of the state, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22a-354v.
(Ord. passed 9-12-2005)
§ 153.02 REGULATIONS TO BE ADOPTED.
   (A)   The Agency shall adopt regulations in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat.
§ 22a-354p and Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.), Conn. Gen.
Stat. § 22a-354i-3(a)(3).
   (B)   The regulations shall provide for:

      (2)   Procedures for the regulation of activity within the area;
      (3)   The form for an application to conduct regulated activities within
the area;
      (4)   Notice and publication requirements;
      (5)   Criteria and procedures for the review of applications; and
      (6)   Administration and enforcement.
(Ord. passed 9-12-2005)
Editor’s note:
   Procedures for adoption of local regulations requires a local public hearing
and public notice requirements in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22a-354p
(b) to allow opportunity for the public to be heard. Also approval by the DEP
Commissioner is required in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22-354p(f) and
R.C.S.A. § 22a-354i-3(a)(3). The DEP approval requires a determination that the
regulations are not inconsistent with the state land use regulations, are
reasonably related to groundwater, and shall not be deemed inconsistent if they
provide a greater level of protection.
§ 153.03 INVENTORY OF LAND USE.
   (A)   In order to carry out the purposes of the aquifer protection program,
the Agency will conduct an inventory of land use within the area to assess
potential contamination sources.
   (B)   Not later than three months after approval by the Commissioner of the
State Department of Environmental Protection of Level B mapping of aquifers,
the Agency will inventory land uses overlying the mapped zone of contribution
and recharge areas of the aquifers in accordance with guidelines established by
the Commissioner pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22a-354f. The inventory shall
be completed not more than one year after authorization of the Agency. See
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22a-354e.
(Ord. passed 9-12-2005)
Editor’s note:
   This requirement is essentially done. The majority of inventories were
completed by DEP in 2000. The purpose of the inventories is to give a general
assessment of the areas and to provide a starting point for informing
potentially regulated facilities of the program requirements. Towns should
consider this a good baseline and update it to reflect current conditions.

applicable provisions of the zoning regulations of the town.
   (B)   In the event that the Hearing Officer determines that he or she will
not have an adequate opportunity to review documentation provided by any party
to the hearing on the date of the hearing, he or she may order the hearing to
be continued to a later date.
   (C)   The Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form
and with methods of proof, as he or she deems fair and appropriate. The rules
regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all
testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The Hearing Officer shall
announce his or her decision at the end of the hearing. If the Hearing Officer
determines that the person who received the citation is not liable, the Hearing
Officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that determination in writing
accordingly. If the Hearing Officer determines that the person who received the
citation is liable for the violation, the Hearing Officer shall forthwith enter
and assess the fines against the person as provided by this subchapter.
   (D)   If the person who receives the citation does not agree with the
Hearing Officer’s assessment, he or she may appeal the decision to the Superior
Court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Connecticut General
Statutes.
   (E)   If the Hearing Officer’s assessment is not paid on the date of its
entry, the Hearing Officer shall send by first class mail a notice of
assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor
more than 12 months after the mailing, a certified copy of the notice of
assessment with the Clerk of the Superior Court together with the applicable
entry or filing fee. Further proceedings may then be held pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes. The certified copy
of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within the
12-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued at the rate
of $150 for each day that the violation continues and filed as one record of
assessment. As provided by state law, the Clerk shall enter judgment, in the
amount of the record of assessment and court costs, against the person in favor
of the town, and the Hearing Officer’s assessment, when so entered as a
judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of
execution on the judgment may issue without further notice to that person.
   (F)   The First Selectman of the town shall appoint one or more Citation
Hearing Officers, who shall be other than a Zoning Enforcement Officer, a
member of the Planning and Zoning Commission or Zoning Beard of Appeals or an
employee of the town to conduct hearings as described in divisions (A) and (C)
above.

   Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 8-1c, there is established a schedule of fees
for the processing of land use applications received by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals and Conservation Commission. The schedule
of fees established shall supersede those fees presently charged by the land
use commissions and boards as previously established pursuant to any provision
of the General Statutes or any special act. These fees are intended to cover a
portion of the town’s costs for processing and administrative handling of land
use applications, including, but not limited to: legal advertisements regarding
public hearings, decisions of a commission and other matters requiring
publication in a newspaper; other notifications or referrals required or
authorized by applicable law; recording and transcribing, where necessary, of
public hearings and meetings, the preparation of minutes and other
documentation applicable to the application and other clerical expenses, staff
salaries and overhead expenses for staff to the Commission, including officials
of the town for whom land use application review is only a part of his or her
duties, such as the Sanitarian, Fire Chief and the like, Town Attorney’s fees
in direct connection with legal advice, review of documents and attendance at
meetings, where deemed desirable, in connection with the application,
inspection of construction and other work to ensure compliance with approved
permits and applicable regulations, keeping and updating of files and other
documentation relative to the application; other expenses as may be incidental
to the processing of land use applications in the town.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 157.61 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Any other
term not defined in this subchapter shall have the meaning set forth in the

for zoning applications, the subdivision regulations for subdivision or
resubdivision applications, inland wetlands and watercourses regulations for
the town and the like).
   COMMISSION(S). One or all of the land use regulatory agencies of the town
known as the Planning and Zoning Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals and Inland
Wetland/Conservation Commission.

(Ord. passed - -)
§ 157.62 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   All boards and agencies of the town, including the use of fire company
properties for fire protection purposes, shall be exempt from the payment of
fees established pursuant to this chapter. Each board may in whole or in part
exempt an application from the payment of any or all fees if the application is
for low and moderate income housing or special needs housing.
   (B)   In addition, each commission shall be authorized, by majority vote, to
reduce or waive application fees where:
      (1)   The application does not appear, upon initial examination, to
require intensive staff review; and
      (2)   The applicant is a non-profit entity which qualifies for tax
deductible charitable contributions under regulations of the United States
Internal Revenue Service.
   (C)   The Commission may also credit all or a portion of application fees
from previous application(s) which were denied or withdrawn, where the review
work performed on the previous application(s) may be of benefit in reviewing
the new application.
   (D)   Any commission exempting an application from payment of a fee, in
whole or in part, shall state in the minutes of the meeting at which the plan
was received, the fee type exempted, the percentage exempt and reasons for
granting the exemption.
   (E)   This exemption shall not prohibit a commission from requiring
consultant reports, professional certification or conducting inspection to
ensure conformance with land use regulations.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 157.63 PAYMENT OF FEES.
   (A)   Other fees. The payment of a fee established in accordance with the

different type of land use application, or by another ordinance of the town.
   (B)   Fees nonrefundable. All fees received by a commission as part of a
land use application submission shall be nonrefundable.

fees shall be paid by cash, check or money order made payable to the town. Fees
shall be paid at the time of application submission. The applicant shall be
provided with invoices or other evidence of any additional expense(s), and
reimbursement to the town shall be made within ten days after presentation of
invoices or other evidence. Failure to comply with this division shall be
grounds for denial of any application without prejudice, or revocation of any
permit previously issued. Reimbursement of the town under this division shall
be a condition for the endorsement of any plan, the issuance of any final
permit or the issuance of any certificate of zoning compliance for an approved
application, or the renewal of any periodic to temporary approval, as the case
may be. An additional fee will be charged for any returned check. Bank checks
and cash will be the only form of payment the town will accept after a check
has been returned. Upon receipt of the returned check to the town, the permit
will be considered null and void until restitution has been made.
   (D)   Updating. Fees will be updated regularly and shall be made available
at the office of each land use department and Town Clerk.
(Ord. passed - -)

additional surcharge fee to cover the estimated reasonable cost of consultant
services.
   (B)   In addition, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Inland Wetlands
Agency may charge the applicant an additional surcharge fee to cover the
actual, reasonable cost of outside consultant services required to review and
inspect a project once an approval has been issued in order to ensure
compliance with the regulations and conditions of approval.
   (C)   Should it be necessary for the applicant to apply to the Zoning Board
of Appeals, permit fees along with any other cost related to the processing or
review of the application may be charged.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 157.65 INTERPRETATION.

provision of the planning and zoning regulations, subdivision regulations or
the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations of the town.
