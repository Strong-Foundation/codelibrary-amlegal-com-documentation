         (a)   As of the date of passage, the applicable provision of W. Va.
Code § 8-19-12a(a)(2):
         “The municipality or governing body, but only one of them, may collect
from all new applicants for service a deposit of $50 or two-twelfths of the
average annual usage of the applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is
greater, to secure the payment of water service rates, fees and charges in the
event they become delinquent as provided in this section. In any case where a
deposit is forfeited to pay service rates, fees and charges which were
delinquent and the user’s service is disconnected or terminated, no
reconnection or reinstatement of service may be made by the municipality or
governing body until another deposit equal to $50 or a sum of the two-twelfths
of the average usage for the applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is
greater, is remitted to the municipality or governing body. After twelve months
of prompt payment history, the municipality or governing body shall return the
deposit to the customer or credit the customer’s account with interest at a
rate as the Public Service Commission may prescribe; provided, that where the
customer is a tenant, the municipality or governing body is not required to
return the deposit until the time the tenant discontinues service with the
municipality or governing body. Whenever any rates, fees, rentals or charges
remain unpaid for a period of twenty days after the same become due and
payable, the user of the services and facilities provided is delinquent and the
user is liable at law until all rates fees and charges are fully paid. The
municipality or governing body may, under reasonable rules promulgated by the
Public Service Commission, shut off and discontinue water services to a
delinquent user of water facilities ten days after the water services become
delinquent regardless of whether the municipality or governing body utilizes
the security deposit to satisfy any delinquent payments; provided further, that
nothing contained within the rules of the Public Service Commission shall be
deemed to require any agents or employees of the municipality or governing body
to accept payment at the customer’s premises in lieu of discontinuing service
for a delinquent bill.”
         (b)   1.   As of the date of passage, the applicable provision of W.
Va. C.S.R. § 150-7-6.2.1.a.:
         “For a municipal water system only, the deposit shall not be more than
either $50 or two-twelfths of the average annual usage of the applicant’s
specific customer class, whichever is greater.”
            2.   This tariff, in accordance with the above cited statutory
language and PSC Water Rules, produces a security deposit of $157.20 (based on
4,000 gpm x two months) for residential customers. All other classes of
customers will have their required deposit calculated in accordance with the
above language in regards to average usage.
      (16)   Bill reprint fee. A charge of $1 will be assessed to customers who
do not present the bar coded section of the bill provided by the Utility with
payment. This does not apply to payments processed by the Town as part of an
electronic funds transfer initiated by the town.
      (17)   Emergency, customer convenience or seasonal turn on or off. There
shall be a $25 charge for each visit to the customer’s premises during normal
business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. through 4:30 p.m.) for such on
or off, except that if the service is both turned off and on within the same
eight hour work day, only one $25 fee shall apply. Reconnection after hours
(Monday through Friday after 4:30 p.m., anytime on holidays and weekends),
shall be subject to an additional $15 fee.
      (18)   Testing or replacement of meter at customer’s request. Upon
request of any customer of the system, the town will test or replace the
customer’s water meter as soon as is reasonably possible for a fee of $25 due
in advance, and if the meter is found to be defective, the customer’s account
will be adjusted accordingly, and the fee refunded. If the meter is found to be
accurate within the prescribed guidelines of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia, then the customer’s account will receive no adjustment.
      (19)   Sprinkler systems and private fire protection systems. Where

the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 77.040 BUSINESS DISTRICT DEFINED.
   The Council has designated the following streets and avenues as the business
district within the town and has designated said district for free parking:
Eighth (Main) Street from the bridge to Fifth Avenue; Ninth Street from First
Avenue to Fifth Avenue; First Avenue from Eighth Street to Ninth Street; Second
Avenue and Third Avenue from Seventh Street to Ninth Street; Fourth Avenue from
the North end of the Marlinton Depot to Ninth Street; and Tenth Avenue from
Judge Street to Jury Street.
(Ord. passed 5-7-2012)
§ 77.041 AREA ONE.
   (A)   The following place shall be designated as “Area One” and shall be
used only for permit parking: on Third Avenue along the Southern States’ fence.
   (B)   Each permit shall cost the sum set by Council from time to time per
month and shall be purchased at intervals covering at least six months each
time.
(Ord. passed 5-7-2012)
§ 77.042 AREA TWO.
   (A)   The following place shall be designated as “Area Two” and shall be
used only for permit parking: the vacant lot between the Flower Garden and the
Pocahontas Times.
   (B)   Each permit shall cost the sum set by Council from time to time per
month and shall be purchased at intervals covering at least six months each
time.
(Ord. passed 5-7-2012)
§ 77.043 PARKING PROHIBITED.
   The Council finds that it is necessary to limit the free parking of vehicles
on Eighth (Main) Street to a reasonable amount of time, during the normal 6:00
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. business hours. The Council further finds that it is
necessary to restrict business owners, business employees and residents who
live on Eighth (Main) Street to no parking during these normal business hours
on Eighth Street. The Council also finds that the purpose of free parking on
Eighth (Main) Street is to encourage and facilitate business in the town.
(Ord. passed 5-7-2012)
U.S. ROUTE 219 PARKING
§ 77.055 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the “U.S. Route 219 Parking Ordinance”.
(Ord. passed 1-4-1992)
§ 77.056 OBSTRUCTION.
   The Council is concerned about the flow of traffic in the newly annexed
portion of the town reaching from the southern end of Burns Motor Freight to
the southern end of the also newly annexed Community of Riverside. There are
numerous businesses in this area on the eastern side of U.S. Route 219 which
requires much of the traffic which utilizes these businesses to cross a lane of
traffic entering these businesses and exiting these businesses. The amount of
traffic which uses these businesses is sufficiently great that the potential
exists for problems in this area. The Council specifically finds that vehicles
parking near Route 219 obstructs the view of drivers entering and exiting these
businesses and that it is imperative for a regulation to be passed to minimize
the possibility of accidents in this area due to vision being obscured by
parked vehicles.
(Ord. passed 1-4-1992)
§ 77.057 REGULATION.
   From and after the effective date of this subchapter it shall be illegal for
any person to park a vehicle along U.S. Route 219 from the southern edge of the
fence of Burns Motor Freight as it adjoins the right- of-way of U.S. Route 219
northward to the southern end of the Community of Riverside so that any part of
the vehicle is within eight feet of the paved portion of the roadway. The
southernmost point of the Community of Riverside shall be determined by
extending a line along the fence which divides the real estate currently owned
by Tom Burns and the Community of Riverside to the edge of the right-of-way of
U.S. Route 219.

TRUCK PARKING
§ 77.085 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the “Marlinton Truck Regulation
Ordinance”.
(Ord. passed 2-3-1986)
§ 77.086 REGULATION.
   The Town Council finds that it is in the best interests of the people of the
town to regulate the movement and parking of trucks within the town limits.
This action is necessitated by the noise created by the unnecessary or
excessive use of such vehicles at night and by the added stress such vehicles
place on certain streets within the town. Streets other than Route 39 are not
constructed to withstand heavy traffic or heavy vehicles and the underlying
natural foundation is not conducive to road building.
(Ord. passed 2-3-1986)
§ 77.087 ILLEGAL PARKING.
   (A)   From and after the effective date of this subchapter, it shall be
unlawful to park trucks of greater than two-ton capacity on public property in
residential areas within the town.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for drivers of trucks of over two-ton capacity to
drive upon or park upon any public roadway or public property within the town
except for Route 39 and further except for local deliveries.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to park any truck of a capacity of two tons or
over on any public property within the town.
(Ord. passed 2-3-1986) Penalty, see §
77.999
§ 77.088 RIGHTS.
   Nothing herein shall limit the rights of individuals or businesses to park
their trucks on their own property, to drive to their homes or places of
business from Route 39 or to drive to Route 39 from their homes or places of
business while engaged in the actual pursuit of business. Nothing herein shall
limit the rights of the town or other public county, state or federal agency to
operate trucks in the town.
(Ord. passed 2-3-1986)
HOSPITAL ZONE
§ 77.100 PARKING IN QUIET ZONE.
   (A)   Statement of policy. The Town Council finds that there are problems
now existing on Main Street (Eighth Street) which need correction. Within the
Hospital Zone, extending from the eastern most corner of the Bank of Marlinton
to the Greenbrier River, there are congregations of people in the evening hours
and these people make loud and unnecessary noise, thereby disturbing the
patients in the Pocahontas Memorial Hospital. The Council further finds that as
a further complication of this matter that people will impede the flow of
traffic through the town by standing in the street and talk to others in cars
or on the sidewalk. These people in the street endanger themselves and increase
the likelihood of automobile accidents. The Town Council finds that they have
not just the right, but the responsibility to do what is necessary to correct
these problems in order to maintain proper quiet in the Hospital Zone and to
maintain the safety of people congregating lawfully within the town.
   (B)   From and after the effective date of this section, it shall be
unlawful for anyone to park his or her vehicle within the Hospital Zone in the
town between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Exceptions to this general
rule are those people parking in order to attend services at the Marlinton
Presbyterian Church, those people going to the Hospital, or those people
parking in order to participate in some legitimate business activity with any
business located in the Hospital Zone. However, it shall remain unlawful for
these people parking lawfully to create any type of disturbance while they are
so lawfully parked in the Hospital Zone. The police authority shall have the
right to inform any such offending person of his or her violation and inform
him or her of what is necessary to correct that violation. Thereafter, any
person continuing to violate this section shall be subject to the penalty
provisions in §
77.999 and shall be further subject to having his or her vehicle towed from the
Hospital Zone at the offender’s expense. If the town places small signs on the
parking meters, then it shall not be incumbent upon the police authority to
inform the violator first before taking any action under this section. If the
police authority informs any person of his or her violation of this section
once, then the officer shall have no further requirement under this section to
inform the violator on subsequent occasions concerning subsequent violations.
(Ord. passed 8-14-1987) Penalty, see §
77.999
§ 77.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   See §
70.99 for general traffic code penalty.
   (B)   (1)   The fines for the following traffic violations shall be as set
by Council from time to time.
      (2)   The Police Department is directed to prepare and have produced an

cost, per each citation.
   (E)   The penalty for a violation of §§
77.055 through
77.057 shall be either incarceration in the county jail for a period not to
exceed 30 days or a fine set by Council from time to time or both such fine and
imprisonment.
   (F)   The penalty for a violation of §§
77.070 through
77.073 shall be a fine set by Council from time to time.
   (G)   The penalty for a violation of any of §
77.087 above shall be a fine set by Council from time to time.
   (H)   For any violation under §
77.100, any person found guilty or pleading guilty shall be subject to a fine
set by Council from time to time, plus mandatory costs. For second and

§ 97.03 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Generally. The following rules have been formulated with the fixed
purpose of protecting the rights and interests of all the lot owners, of
securing good order within the Mountain View Cemetery, herewith identified as
the cemetery. By safeguarding the interests of the cemetery as a whole, the
interests of each lot owner are safeguarded. All persons are required to comply
with these rules, copies of which, revised and corrected to date, may be
obtained at any time upon application to the Mayor, herewith identified as
Superintendent.
   (B)   Special cases. Special cases may arise in which the literal
enforcement of a rule may impose unnecessary hardship. The cemetery, therefore,
reserves the right, without notice, to make exceptions, suspensions or
modifications of any of the rules and regulations when, in its judgment, the
same appears advisable; however, such temporary exceptions, suspensions or
modifications shall in no way be construed as affecting the general application
of such rule.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CEMETERY. Where authority is implied, means the Town Council of
Marlinton, West Virginia, or any commission, committee, board or other agency
that may be authorized by the Town Council to exercise its powers, privileges
and duties with respect to the cemetery.
      LOT. One or more grave sites.
      SUPERINTENDENT. The persons in active control of cemetery operations.
   (D)   Rules and regulations.
      (1)   No lot shall be used for any purpose other than the burial of the
human dead.
      (2)   The name and address of every lot owner shall be on record at the
office of the Superintendent of the cemetery. Such records together with a deed
shall be sufficient warrant to the cemetery in all matters pertaining to the
ownership of a lot. In the event of a change of address, the Superintendent of
the Mountain View Cemetery, Marlinton, West Virginia, should be notified at
once.
      (3)   Upon the death of a lot owner, his or her heirs or devisees should
immediately file with the Superintendent proof of the new ownership. This is
important as no interments can be permitted until such proof is given because
of the difficulties in determining the persons who may inherit the rights of a
lot owner in his or her lot and in order to avoid serious disputes and
inconveniences that may arise subsequent to the death of a lot owner, it is
recommended that the lot owner make provision for the definite disposition of
his or her lot during his or her lifetime. He or she may, by will, devise the
lot to a named person or persons, or he or she may, either by will or by deed,
convey the lot the town in trust, designating the person or persons who may be
buried therein.
      (4)   No transfer or assignment of any lots or interest therein shall be
valid without the prior written consent of the cemetery, endorsed upon the
conveyance and entered upon the cemetery records.
      (5)   The cemetery reserves the right to refuse interment in any lot
except on the written authority of the lot owner. In case the lot is jointly
owned, the interment of any member of the immediate family of any one of the
owners may be made upon his or her sole written authorization. No person
outside the immediate family of the lot owner may be interred in a lot without
the written consent of the lot owner or owners who, under no circumstances,
shall allow interments to be made on any lot for remuneration. No protest of
interment will be recognized by the cemetery unless it is in writing and filed
with the Superintendent of the cemetery, and the cemetery shall in no way be
liable for any delay in any interment resulting from such protest or from
noncompliance with these rules.
      (6)   Whenever instructions regarding the location of an interment space
cannot be obtained or are indefinite or if, for any reason, the grave cannot be
opened in the location specified, the Superintendent may open it at such
location as may seem best under the circumstances so as not to delay the
funeral services. In order to avoid misunderstandings, it is urged that the lot
owner or some member of the family come to the cemetery and locate the grave
and orders for location of graves or for any other work be made in writing. The
cemetery cannot be held responsible for mistakes made when such orders are
given by telephone.
      (7)   All interment spaces shall be opened and closed only by cemetery
employees for whom charges fixed by the cemetery will be made and shall either
be paid for in advance or assumed by a funeral director. Notice for opening an
interment space must be given at least 24 hours in advance of the funeral
service. No disinterment, except as provided under division (D)(8) below, shall
be made without the written consent of all of the next of kin of the person
whose body is to be removed.
      (8)   No interment shall be permitted until the purchase price of the lot
has been fully paid. In the event there is default under an installment
purchase agreement then the cemetery shall have the right, at any time after 20
days’ notice mailed to the owner of the lot as shown on the cemetery records,
to remove to single graves chosen by the Superintendent each of the remains
interred in said lot. The cemetery shall also have the right to remove any
memorials that may have been placed thereon.
      (9)   Tents, artificial grass, lowering devices and other equipment owned
or authorized by the cemetery shall be used in making interments. The charge
for preparing interment spaces includes the use of such equipment.
      (10)   All grading, landscape and maintenance work, and improvements on
lots shall be done under the direction of the Superintendent and only by
employees of the cemetery, except when the Superintendent otherwise grants
permission. Visitors and lot owners are requested not to offer money to
cemetery employees since they are forbidden to accept any fee or gratuity
except from the cemetery and may be dismissed for violation of this rule.
      (11)   If any lot owner desires special work to be done on his or her
lot, such as special planting repairing and cleaning of monuments, placing and
removing of cut flowers, potted plants, wreaths, decorations and the like, the
Superintendent will be glad to give estimates of the cost of such work either
upon an annual basis or for a particular service. All charges for such special
work are payable in advance.
      (12)   In the future, no fences, copings, hedges, flower borders,
trellises or other enclosures of any kind, and no benches, settees or other
similar articles shall be placed upon any lot, and if so placed, or in the
event present ones become unsightly or detrimental to the uniform beauty of the
cemetery, then the Superintendent shall have the right to remove them.
      (13)   No trees, shrubs, plants, vines or flowers shall be planted on or
removed from any lot except with the permission and under the direction of the
Superintendent, who shall have the right to plant, prune, remove or transplant
any trees, shrubs, plants, vines or flowers upon any lot when he or she deems
it necessary or advisable.
      (14)   No glass flower receptacles may be placed on any lot. All baskets,
potted plants, cut flowers, perishable plants, emblems and the like placed on
lots shall be removed as soon as they become unsightly or faded.
      (15)   No grave mounds will be permitted and the established grade of any
lot cannot be changed without permission of the Superintendent.
      (16)   Although the cemetery has no desire to interfere with the
individual taste of lot owners concerning monumental objects, in the interest
of the cemetery as a whole the cemetery reserves the right to prevent the
erection of any monument, memorial, marker or other structure which the
Superintendent considers objectionable to the cemetery it also reserves the
right to refuse to permit the erection of any monumental object on a lot whose
owner is in arrears in the payment of any indebtedness to the cemetery. In
certain sections the lots are sold subject to restrictions as to size, type,
number and location of monumental objects. Therefore, in order to avoid
misunderstandings, no monument shall be erected without the written consent of
the Superintendent. It is very important that lot owners consult with the
Superintendent before selecting monuments or closing a purchase of the same so
as to avoid expensive mistakes or serious disappointments.
      (17)   Granite is the only kind of stone recommended for monumental
objects. Marble, limestone, sandstone, terra cotta and others composed of soft
material are not durable in this climate and, therefore, their use is not
recommended.
      (18)   No mausoleum, tomb or vault built partially or entirely above
ground shall be permitted on any lot unless the plans therefore have been
approved by the Superintendent, and unless there has been deposited in the
Mountain View Cemetery Trust by the person erecting such structure a sum of
money, the income from which will, in the judgment of the cemetery authority,
be sufficient for the permanent maintenance of such structure.
      (19)   Foundations for all monumental objects must be prepared by the
cemetery and must be paid for in advance at a charge fixed by the cemetery. The
setting and erection of all monumental objects shall be under the supervision
of the Superintendent.
      (20)   The cemetery reserves the right to care for and repair or to
remove any monument or structure which has, through decay, dilapidation or for
any other reason, become unsightly or dangerous.
      (21)   All work in the cemetery in the neighborhood of a funeral must be
stopped during the interment services. No traffic of any kind shall pass the
section where services are being held. No strangers will be permitted to gather
at a grave where an interment is being held.
      (22)   The cemetery will take every reasonable precaution to protect all
private property of lot owners in the cemetery from loss or damage, but it
distinctly disclaims all responsibility for loss or damage from causes beyond
its reasonable control and especially from the acts of thieves, vandals,
rioters and malicious mischief-makers.
      (23)   The cemetery reserves the right to enlarge, reduce, replant and
change the boundaries or grading of the cemetery or a section, including the
right to modify and change the location of, or remove and re-grade, roads,
walks, paths or drives the right to lay, maintain, operate or change water
lines, sanitary or storm water drains, sprinkling systems, gutters, lakes and
the like, is also reserved, as well as the right to use cemetery property not
sold to individual lot owners for cemetery purposes or for anything necessary
or incidental thereto. The cemetery reserves to itself a perpetual right of
ingress and egress over lots for the purpose of passing to or from other lots.
      (24)   The cemetery reserves the right to change these rules and
regulations from time to time without notice.
      (25)   All persons are reminded that the cemetery grounds are sacredly
devoted to the interment of the dead and that strict observance of the
proprieties due such a place is required whether or not they are specifically
embraced in these rules. The Superintendent is charged with the enforcement of
these rules and with the general welfare of the cemetery, and he or she is
authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to preserve the peace and
dignity thereof.
   (E)   New sections. New sections will be governed by these same rules and
regulations.

(Prior Code, § 9-104) (Ord. passed 8-1-1983) Penalty, see §
131.99
§ 131.02 FALSE EMERGENCY ALARMS.
   It shall be unlawful for any person intentionally to make, turn in or give a
false alarm of fire, explosion or impending danger of explosion or of need for
police or ambulance assistance or to aid or abet in the commission of such an
act.
(Prior Code, § 9-116) (Ord. passed 8-1-1983) Penalty, see §
131.99
Statutory reference:
   Similar provisions, see W. Va. Code § 15A-10-20
§ 131.03 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator's conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

and imprisonment.

confinement in the county jail for a term not to exceed 30 days or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
(Prior Code, § 9-116)
   (D)   For any violation under §
131.03, the person found guilty or pleading guilty shall be subject to a fine
set by Council from time to time. For second and subsequent violations, there
shall be a fine set by Council from time to time, plus all mandatory court
costs.

one-half cubic feet or more and an opening of 50 square inches or more and
which has a door or lid equipped with a hinge, latch or other fastening device
capable of securing such door or lid, without rendering such equipment harmless
to human life by removing such hinges, latches or other hardware which may
cause a person to be contained therein. This section shall not apply to a
refrigerator or other airtight or semi-airtight container located in that part
of a building occupied by a dealer, warehouseman or repairman. Each day that a
person remains in noncompliance with this section shall constitute a separate
offense. The application or use of any penal statute or ordinance shall not be
held to prevent the removal of the prohibited conditions, and the town shall
have the right, in addition to the penal provisions, to proceed in any court
having jurisdiction for correction of the same by any lawful procedure provided
for by the statutes of the state.
(Prior Code, § 9-117) (Ord. passed 8-1-1983) Penalty, see §

§ 132.04 CURFEW.
   (A)   This section shall be known as the “Marlinton Curfew Ordinance”.
   (B)   The Town Council finds that there exists within the town a problem
with children under the age of 18 years remaining on the streets of the town at
late hours. Such children are apt to do acts of vandalism or other mischief or
are open to harm from other persons in the general public. The Town Council
finds that public policy requires the town to enact an ordinance providing for
the protection of such children from others and to protect the general public
from harm done by certain children. The Town Council finds that a curfew
ordinance limiting the time children may remain on the streets to be one step
towards such protection and to be consistent with public policy.
   (C)   From and after the effective date of this section, a curfew shall be
placed on the town from the hours of 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. during which time
no person under the age of 18 years shall be allowed to remain in any public
place in the town. Exceptions for the foregoing include:
      (1)   Children accompanied by their parents or other person having legal
custody of them;
      (2)   Children on an emergency errand;
      (3)   Children returning from a church, school, athletic or other
recreational activity authorized by the parents of such children or by such
other persons having legal custody of the children; however, such children must
not remain in any public place longer than one-half hour after the termination
of such authorized activity; and
      (4)   Children engaged in any lawful employment, trade, occupation or
profession.
   (D)   Sponsors of events in the town which terminate after the hour of 10:30
p.m. must so inform the Mayor’s office or the town’s Police Department of such
activity and the hour of termination.
   (E)   Whenever a child under the age of 18 shall be found in the town in a
public place after the hour of 11:00 p.m. and before the hour of 6:00 a.m., the
police shall confront the child for the purpose of obtaining his or her name,
age, address and name or names of the child’s parent or parents or other
persons having legal custody of him or her. The police may then take such child
to his or her home but under no circumstances shall such child be taken to the
county jail. If the police have probable cause to believe that the child has
committed a violation of the criminal law of the state or the town, they shall,
in addition to taking said child home, contact the Department of Human Services
and the prosecuting attorney’s office on the following day to determine the
suitability of filing a juvenile petition in circuit court. Such parents or
others having legal custody of said child shall then be notified by certified
mail of such a violation of this section and that any further violation could
result in fine or imprisonment or both.
   (F)   If the parents of the child are not at home, when the police are
taking a child home for a violation of the curfew imposed by this section, the
police may detain the child until such parents or other persons having legal
custody over the child or such other persons willing to assume responsibility
for the child can be found.

desist by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her lawful capacity, shall
be guilty of disorderly conduct.
(Ord. passed 7-6-1987) Penalty, see §
132.99
§ 132.06 NOISE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to create, assist in creating,
permit, continue or permit the continuance of any unreasonably loud and/or
raucous, disturbing, unusual or unreasonably loud sound which annoys, disturbs,
injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others
within the limits of the town. For the purpose of this section, sound shall
include vibrations caused by human, animal or mechanical means. A person shall
not be in violation of this section unless any such sound is perceived on
another property, it being solely the intent of this section to prohibit sounds
from carrying from one property to adjacent or nearby properties, or a public
right-of-way.
   (B)   Within the town limits, the following activities are prohibited if
they produce audible sound beyond the property line of the property on which
they are conducted or from a public right-of-way:

other animal to bark, howl or in any other manner disturb the quiet of any
persons.
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Emergency work necessary to restore property to a safe condition
following a fire, accident or natural disaster; to restore public utilities, or
to protect persons or property from an imminent danger;
      (2)   Sound made to alert persons to the existence of an emergency,
danger or attempted crime; and
      (3)   Activities or operations of governmental units or agencies.
   (D)   Whenever noise or sound is made, created or continued in violation of
the provisions of this section, and if the property upon which or from which
the sound is emanating has two or more occupants, and it cannot be determined
which occupant is the violator, the owner of the property, if present shall be
presumed to be responsible for the violation; in the absence of the owner of
the property, the tenant, sub-tenant, licensee, invites or guest then in
control of the property shall be presumed to be responsible for the violation.
In the event that it is impossible to determine the person then in control of
the property, it shall be presumed that the owner of the property, if present,
is responsible and if not present, all persons then on or in said property
shall be ordered to disperse and leave said property and a failure to do so by
any person shall itself be a municipal infraction punishable under the
provisions of this section.
   (E)   When a violation of this section occurs, a law enforcement officer
shall undertake to notify the persons present in or on the property from which
the sound or activity is emanating that they are in violation and notify them
to cease and desist whatever is causing the violation. At this time the law
enforcement officer shall also ascertain, if reasonably possible, the owner or
the tenant of the property in question. Notice hereunder may be given orally by
the officer to the owner and/or posting a written notice on the premises where
such violation is occurring. Any written notice posted shall contain a specific
description of the nature of the violation.
   (F)   The continuation of such violation or any subsequent violation of the
same proscription following receipt of the notice to cease and desist shall
constitute a municipal infraction punishable as hereinafter set forth.

action is a prima facie evidence that the driver of such motor vehicle intended
to violate the provisions of §

is prima facie evidence that the owner and driver of such motor vehicle
intended to violate the provisions of §
135.04.

   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the town.
(Prior Code, § 4-1101) (Ord. passed 8-3-2020)
§ 150.231 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The town has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (B)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the town, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (C)   This subchapter ensures that, through a registration, inspection and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and /or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (D)   The town, by and through its departments (particularly the building
inspector and Building Maintenance Board) shall inspect and monitor vacant
buildings, shall assess the effects of the condition of those buildings on
nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate and
develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (E)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the procedure (that
is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens,
appeals and due process lien enforcement) by placing the responsibility to
register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner before a
building’s condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a complaint.
(Prior Code, § 4-1102) (Ord. passed 8-3-2020)
§ 150.232 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BOARDED. A building or structure subject to the provision of this subchapter
shall be deemed to be BOARDED if, in place of one or more exterior doors, other
than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a sheet or sheets of
plywood or similar material covering the space for such door or window.
   CONTINUAL. Is meant to be without more than one 30-day interruption in any
given 360-day period. In order for such continual utility service to be
considered as being actually in use as described in this subchapter, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes. The person or entity
asserting that there has been continual utility service has the burden to
produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
   EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE AND MAJOR SYSTEMS. The safe and lawful maintenance of
the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior of the
building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the roof, the
electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer system and

by the Building Maintenance Board, particularly in connection with codes
adopted by the town as well as all applicable local, state and federal laws.
   OCCUPIED. Any building or structure shall be deemed to be occupied if one or
more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or any part
of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or equitable
owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis, or any
combination of the same. For purposes of this subchapter, evidence offered to
prove that a building is so OCCUPIED may include, but shall not be limited to,
the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid business license, or the most recent, federal, state income
tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official business or
residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or proof of
bona fide pre-rental inspection.
   OPEN. A building or structure subject to the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to be OPEN if any one or more exterior doors other than a storm
door is broken, open and/or closed but, without a properly functioning lock to
secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not capable of being locked
and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the same.
   OWNER. An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser estate
therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents, receiver,
executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or corporation that
is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to the provisions of
this subchapter, and as set forth below.
   VACANT. A building or structure shall be deemed to be VACANT if no person or
persons actually, currently, conduct a lawfully licensed business, or lawfully
reside, dwell or live in any part of the building as the legal or equitable
owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on a
permanent, non-transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed VACANT
and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided herein
if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service and the like.
(Prior Code, § 4-1103) (Ord. passed 8-3-2020)
§ 150.233 STANDARDS.
   All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria.
   (A)   Exterior property areas are to be mowed regularly and non-cultivated
gardens maintained at no more than 12 inches of growth. All noxious weeds are

structure and install two GFCI protected receptacles.
   (D)   NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the entire
structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
   (E)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be

or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
   (H)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the owner
to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above items.
   (I)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.

any building that is found to be vacant as defined herein.
   (B)   (1)   When the building inspector has reason to believe that a
structure is a vacant structure and that the owner has failed to register in

either:
         (a)   Register the structure in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter; or

vacant structure itself, the building inspector shall, via registered mail or
via regular mail if registered mail is unsuccessful, send a copy of the same
notice to the record owner of the property according the tax or other public
records maintained by the Assessor or Sheriff of the county. If, within 30 days
of posting and mailing, the owner has neither registered the property in the
vacant property registration created by this subchapter nor demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the building inspector that the property is not a vacant
structure, then the building inspector shall add the structure to the vacant
property registry using the information of record in the office of the Assessor
or Sheriff of the county.
   (C)   The following are exempt from the requirements of this subchapter:
      (1)   Any building owned by town, state or federal government, or any of
their respective agencies or political subdivisions;
      (2)   A new building under construction or property that is undergoing,
in the reasonable discretion of the building inspector, an active renovation or
rehabilitation;
      (3)   Any property being actively marketed; provided, however, this

continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service and the like. For purposes of this
division (C)(4), REGULAR USE is use of the property for a minimum of ten days
in each calendar year. For purposes of this section, CONTINUAL is meant to be
without more than one 30-day interruption in any given 360-day period.
(Prior Code, § 4-1105) (Ord. passed 8-3-2020)
§ 150.235 INSPECTIONS.
   At the time of registration, and upon the annual renewal thereof, the Mayor,
building inspector, Fire Chief and Police Chief shall determine whether it is
necessary for any or all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any
public safety issues needing addressed. Inspections shall also be available to
verify the status of any property concerning occupancy, vacancy and the like.
If an internal inspection is deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of,
and arrangements made for, the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent
to and arrange for an inspection, the town will seek an administrative search
warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include the
municipal court, to authorize inspection of the premises for the purpose of
determining the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to
ensure its structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by
firefighters and police officers in time of emergency, and that the building
and its contents do not present a hazard to the public during the time that the
building remains vacant.
(Prior Code, § 4-1106) (Ord. passed 8-3-2020)
§ 150.236 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   Subsequent to any inspection performed pursuant to §

150.234(C)(3). Fees arising under this subchapter shall continue to accrue at
the applicable rate until the structure either no longer constitutes a vacant
structure or qualifies for an exemption, all transfers of ownership
notwithstanding. All fees arising under this subchapter shall run with the
property and failure to pay such fees may result in the town filing a lien that
attaches upon the property

constitute a violation punishable upon conviction thereof by a fine.
   (B)   After the owner is given notice of the amount of the registration fee
due, except for those owners that have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to
§
150.238, and the owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount of the fine
shall constitute a debt due and owing to the town and the town may commence a
civil action to collect such unpaid debt.
   (C)   If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the town

   PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. Where at least 51% of the actual cash value of a
structure, less land value, is above ground.
   REASONABLY SAFE FROM FLOODING. During the base flood, water should not
damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the base flood should
not damage existing or proposed structures.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person who has been duly registered or
licensed as a registered professional engineer by the West Virginia State Board
of Registration for Professional Engineers as required under W. Va. Code
Chapter 30 Article 13 et seq.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, or, if full compliance is not
possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the noncompliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. The land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance
Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30 and A99. The
term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically
listed or otherwise described in this chapter.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.
      (1)   The definition below for START OF CONSTRUCTION is to be used only
when calculating the starting time for expiration of a permit.
      (2)   The date the permit was issued, including permits for substantial
improvement or repair of substantial damage, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START
means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STATE COORDINATING OFFICE. The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security
and Emergency Management.
   STREAM. As defined in W.Va Code § 7-1-3U, any watercourse, whether natural
or human-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of their size,
through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its
volume.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. See SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
      (2)   This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage”, as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      (3)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT as defined above, must comply with all
ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   For the purpose of this definition, IMPROVEMENT is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
   TOP OF BANK. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a
stream indicate the TOP OF BANK. In the field a professional familiar with
fluvial geomorphology should document the TOP OF BANK. When a professional is
not employed the TOP OF THE BANK will be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
   VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant
with all requirements of this chapter. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such
time as that documentation is provided.

an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been delineated; and
   (D)   The approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 100-year
flood elevations have been provided.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.032 CHANGES IN DESIGNATION OF AREA.
   (A)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the Town Council where natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or more
detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a
River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual document the
necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   (B)   A community’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable
but, not later than six months after the date such information becomes
available, the community shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
   (C)   The town may identify and regulate new flood hazard or ponding areas.
These areas may be delineated on a “Local Flood Hazard Map using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high water marks and/or approximate study methodologies.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.033 ELEVATIONS PREVAIL.
   (A)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within an
identified flood hazard area is at or above the base flood elevation specified
in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to conform to
the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-related
development codes in §
152.075. Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to
apply for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the special flood
hazard area designation removed from the parcel or structure.
   (B)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is below
the base flood elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site shall
be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure shall
be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.034 BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any district boundary arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Town Council. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA
§ 152.045 FLOODWAY (F1).
   (A)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment will not result in any increase in the base flood elevation.
   (B)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.046 FLOODWAY FRINGE (F2).
   Within any floodway fringe area any development and/or use of land shall be
permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.047 AE ZONE WITHOUT FLOODWAY.
   Within any AE without floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of the
floodway area where determined.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.048 APPROXIMATED FLOODPLAIN (ZONE A).
   (A)   Within any approximated floodplain area.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from federal, state or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   (a)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine:
            1.   The amount being invested; and
            2.   The specific flood risk at the site.
         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to
determine the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe
from flooding using the techniques set forth in the town’s approximate A zone
administrative procedures. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required,
they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (B)   Development. Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted
provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.049 ALTERATION OR RELOCATION OF A STREAM.
   (A)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within the
floodplain area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail, the
town’s Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating Office, any adjacent
communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended activities
prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all required
notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration. In
addition prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall
require copies of all necessary permits from those governmental agencies from
which federal or state law requires approval. Contact information for state and
federal permitting authorities as well as addresses for required notification
of appropriate county, state and federal government agencies are contained in
the town’s stream alteration administrative procedures.
   (B)   The developer shall also assure the town in writing that the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
   (D)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream crossings
shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this chapter.
   (E)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this
agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
152.999.
   (F)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.

(Ord. passed 4-14-2010)
§ 152.062 ELEVATION AND FLOOD PROOFING INFORMATION.
   (A)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this chapter. In order to obtain an elevation
credited flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing
must extend at least five-tenths feet above the base flood elevation.
   (B)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information
shall also be included in the application for work within the floodplain area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation.
         (a)   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
         (b)   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor;
         (c)   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure

         (d)   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas and the like) from flooding to two feet
above the base flood elevation at the building site;
         (e)   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error;
         (f)   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared
by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification.
The elevation certificate must confirm that the structure in question together
with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions;
         (g)   A nonconversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a nonconforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
base flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement shall
state:
            1.   The area below base floor elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this chapter; and
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
152.999.
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the base flood
elevation (nonresidential structures only).
         (a)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood
proofing requirements contained herein.
         (b)   Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing
the level of flood proofing above the height required by this chapter. In order
to obtain an “elevation credited” flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed
buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above the base flood
elevation:
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base floor, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits;
certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor; and
            3.   A flood proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in division (B)(2)(b)1. above, stating the structure in question,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
               a.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the base floor elevation; and
               b.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures and other factors associated with the base floor.
      (3)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials - used
solely for parking of vehicles, or storage, (appurtenant structures only).
         (a)   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site;
         (b)   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the base floor elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the base floor elevation;
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         (c)   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
152.999.

§ 152.063 SITE PLAN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a mapped floodplain area
and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (B)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section;
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites and fills;
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas. A registered professional
engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site plan;
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten lots or two acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall
delineate a floodway:
         (a)   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the base flood;
         (b)   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department; and
         (c)   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the floodplain area and all proposed development including fill will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the approximated
floodplain area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
base floor elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two or five
feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed and
the location of the floodplain boundary as scaled from the FEMA map. A
registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or others of
demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.

storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by
a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      (4)   Non-conversion agreement.
         (a)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant on
all flood proofed structures and any elevated structures when the community
determines that the area below the first floor could be converted to a
nonconforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below base flood
elevation that are five feet high or more).
         (b)   This agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below base floor elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this chapter; and
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
152.999.
   (B)   Manufactured home placement. Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of
substantial damage to property.
      (1)   All manufactured homes to be sited within the identified flood
hazard areas of the town shall be installed by a contractor possessing a valid
state manufactured home installer’s license. The installer shall use an
installation design engineered to withstand flood hazards specific to the
particular home site. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within the flood hazard areas shall be installed in accordance with the
following standards:
         (a)   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat
pump shall be elevated two feet above the base floor elevation;
         (b)   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for use
in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating dry stacked block
piers shall not be used in flood hazard areas;
         (c)   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
C.S.R. 10A.2 and 10B as authorized by W. Va. Code § 21-9-4. The anchoring shall
be adequate to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, the over-the-top and frame ties,
attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate
to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces; and
         (d)   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings; this type of skirting can collapse during
floods and compromise supporting piers. The openings must be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         (e)   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored
and vented.
      (2)   The licensed state manufactured home installer placing the unit
shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the manufactured
home has been installed to the standards set forth in this chapter.
   (C)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(2) below, appurtenant structures
shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet above the
base floor elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the base floor elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         (a)   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000;
         (b)   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side;
         (c)   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
         (d)   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
         (e)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the base floor elevation;
         (f)   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the base floor elevation; and
         (g)   The venting requirements contained in division (A) above are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   In addition, a non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this chapter. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers
of the existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized
signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
152.999.
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
chapter.
   (E)   Fill.
      (1)   The Town Council officially recognizes the beneficial functions the
floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods.
Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   All fill placed in other floodplain areas shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         (a)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The town may require the applicant to
demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would not adversely
affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like, shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the town. During
permit review the community shall consider the following issues that have the
potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights;
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property;
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures;
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems; and
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography, stream
blockages and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system;
         (c)   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding);
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required in division (E)(3)(e) below. For nonresidential structures,
fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use;
         (e)   At grade access, with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a
nonresidential structure;
         (f)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted, no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site;
         (g)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure;
         (h)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator;
         (i)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion;
         (j)   All applicants placing fill in a mapped flood hazard area must
obtain a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a letter of map revision
based on fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued; and
         (k)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on
the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below
the base floor elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this division (H).
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the flood
protection setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the flood
protection setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below base floor elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this chapter, material that resembles “fill” material
shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Backflow prevention valves should be used for all
enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.

provisions of this chapter or direction of the Floodplain Administrator, or any
other authorized employee of the community, shall be unlawful and shall be
referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall expeditiously prosecute all such
violators. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the town set by
Council from time to time plus cost of prosecution. In default of such payment
such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed ten days. Each day
during which any violation of this chapter continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
noncompliance with, this chapter shall not excuse the violation or
noncompliance with the chapter or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by the Town
