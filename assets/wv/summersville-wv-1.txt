EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

laws in force at the time such proceedings take place, unless otherwise

applied to any judgment pronounced after it has taken effect.
(WVaC 2-2-8)
 
   (c)    The repeal by any provision of the Codified Ordinances of an

the validity of such acts, contracts or transactions, but the same shall remain
as valid as if there had been no such repeal, but no further.
(WVaC 2-2-11)
 
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified
Ordinances, such reference shall extend to and include any amendment of or
supplement to the section or group of sections so referred to or any section or
sections hereafter enacted in lieu thereof; and unless otherwise provided,
whenever a reference to a section or group of sections is made in any amendment
or supplement to any section of the Codified Ordinances hereafter enacted, such
reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended.
   Whenever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a section
or an inclusive group of sections, such reference shall be constructed to mean
a violation of any provision of the section or sections included in such
reference.
References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

101.07 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, articles or sections of the Codified
Ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
 
101.08 SEPARABILITY.
   Each section of the Codified Ordinances and every part of each section is an
independent section and part of a section, and the holding of any section or a
part thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause does not
affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.
 
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any
act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be fined not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days or both. Each
day any such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

GENERAL INFORMATION
139.01 INTRODUCTION.
   These employee guidelines are intended to be effective immediately after
adoption, for all employees of the City of Summersville (COS).
   The policies and procedures in this manual are designed to serve as
guidelines for management action. They are not intended to create any contract
or binding agreement between COS and any employee. All guidelines outlined in
this handbook are subject to change or modification at the COS's discretion at
any time.
   This manual is provided for informational purposes only. No provision or
portion of the handbook constitutes an implied or expressed contract, guarantee
or assurance of employment or any right to an employment-related benefit or
procedure. The COS reserves the right to change, modify, eliminate or deviate
from any policy or procedure in this manual at any time and to hire, transfer,
promote, discipline, terminate and otherwise manage its employees as it deems
appropriate.
   In addition to these guidelines, Department Supervisors may establish rules
and regulations that relate specifically to their department. Departmental
policies shall not conflict with these employee guidelines and must be approved
by the Mayor.
   The Police Department is governed under State Code Chapter 8, Article 14,
Section 1, et. seq. as applicable.
   If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please consult with
your supervisor or human resources (HR) representative.
139.02 PROFILE.
   The City of Summersville is the County Seat of Nicholas County and is
located in central West Virginia. Summersville is one of the premier tourist
attractions in the State. Summersville has a unique advantage of being a small
city with big city opportunities. The excellent quality of life in Summersville
is exemplified by our beautiful mountains, wonderful citizens, and the many
recreational activities. Business and individuals looking for a home will find
that Summersville has a skilled workforce, ready access to a major
transportation route, and a community with a proactive approach to economic
development.
139.03 MISSION STATEMENT.
   Our mission is to make the City of Summersville a wonderful place to live,
work and visit by providing cost-effective government and services to enrich
the quality of life of those we serve, as well as, promote community spirit,
pride and tourism.
139.04  MANAGEMENT RIGHTS.
   The COS retains exclusive rights to manage the organization, its activities
and employees. Any powers not subscribed by law or specified abrogated in these
policies shall be retained by the COS.
139.05 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   The COS provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and
applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
ancestry, age, disability, veteran status or any other legally protected status
in accordance with applicable state, federal, or local law. This policy applies
to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to,
hiring, placement, promotion, termination from employment, layoff, recall,
transfer, compensation, and training.
   The COS expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee discrimination
and/or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,
ancestry, disability, veteran status, or status in any group protected by
state, federal, or local law.
   Making offensive or inappropriate comments or engaging in other unlawful
harassing conduct due to race, color, religion, sex, age, ancestry, national
origin, disability, or veteran status will not be tolerated.
   Any employee that believes he or she may have been denied equal employment
opportunity, or may have been subjected to unlawful harassment, must report the
matter immediately and in writing to the HR Manager and the matter will be
investigated. If an employee does not feel comfortable reporting the matter to
the HR Manager, he or she shall report the matter in writing to the Mayor for
investigation. All employees shall cooperate fully in any investigation of
unlawful harassment and discrimination.
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
139.06  HIRING PROCEDURE.
   All prospective employees shall complete the approved application for
employment, which will then be submitted to the respective department head for
comment and recommendation. The Mayor will have final responsibility to hire
qualified employees to fill positions allotted in the approved budget.
   Applicants will be selected for employment based on merit, considering the
candidate's knowledge, skills and abilities; ability to communicate; ability to
meet job requirements as evidenced by information contained on application
forms/resumes received by COS; personal interviews; as well as any additional
criteria appropriate to the task.
   Relatives of currently employed worker generally are considered for
employment on the basis of the above criteria. However, where the employment or
hiring of a worker's relative would result in the types of prohibited
employment relationships identified below, COS will consider the candidate for
employment only in the scope of the following:
   Prohibited Employment Relationships The hiring of relatives is prohibited if
the employment of such an individual would result in the creation of:
   •   A supervisor/subordinate relationship between a relative and an
employee. If a direct supervisory or managerial relationship would be
established, a relative of a currently employed worker cannot be considered as
an applicant for an open position.
   •   An actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of
interest. Generally, this bars the hiring or employment of an employee's
relatives in any position that has an auditing or control relationship to the
employee's job.
   Definition of Relatives For the purpose of this policy, relatives include
the following: spouse, parent, child, sibling, in-law, grandparent, grandchild,
aunt, uncle, cousin, step-relative or any individual with whom an employee has
a close personal relationship such as a domestic partner, co-habitant or
significant other.
   Marriages or Relationships Between Employees Employees who marry or
establish a close personal relationship can continue in their current positions
if a prohibited employment relationship is not created. If one of the
prohibited situations does occur, attempts will be made to find another
position within the City to which one of the employees can transfer. All
practical efforts will be made to arrange such a transfer at the earliest
possible time. If accommodations of this nature are not feasible the employees
will be permitted to determine which one of them will resign.
   This policy applies to hiring and employment decision affecting all job
classifications, including regular, temporary and part-time positions. These
restrictions also are applicable when assigning, transferring, bidding or
promoting an employee.
   Employees who become subject to this policy's provisions due to marriage or
commencement of a close personal relationship must inform their supervisor or
Mayor as soon as practical. All decisions and personnel actions taken as a
result of this policy must be reviewed and approved by the Mayor.
139.07 JOB VACANCY POSTING.
   It shall be the policy of COS to post vacant positions so that qualified
employees will be given an opportunity for job vacancies.
139.08 EMPLOYEE STATUS.
   All employees are "at-will" employees of COS. If hired or currently
employed, employment can be terminated with or without notice at any time for
any reason or for no reason.
139.09 INTRODUCTORY PERIOD.
   The first ninety (90) calendar days of employment can be considered as an
introductory period. This period will afford new employees an opportunity to
familiarize themselves with their work and new surroundings and management to
evaluate performance, work habits and attitudes, and compatibility with work
environment. The length of the introductory period can be extended or reduced
if the Mayor determines that such an extension or reduction is warranted.
   Upon satisfactorily completing the introductory period an employee becomes
entitled to accrued leave and other fringe benefits subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations of those benefit programs. Vacation days and sick
leave will be accumulated during the introductory period if the employee is
retained as a regular full-time employee.
139.10  CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT.
   It shall be the policy of COS to categorize employees under one or more of
the following categories:
Full-time
A full-time employee is one who is regularly assigned to work more than thirty
(30) straight time hours per week.
Part-time
A part-time employee is one who is regularly assigned to work less than thirty
(30) straight time hours per week. (Excluded from employee benefits)
Seasonal or Temporary
Anyone employed for a specifically defined period or task that shall be
terminated at the conclusion of the period or task shall be considered a
temporary employee. (Excluded from employee benefits)
Contractor
Any person, firm or corporation employed for a specific "purchase of services"
or like agreement that receives gross monetary consideration according to the
terms of a written agreement shall be known as a contractor. Contractors are
not entitled to any employee benefits including withholding of taxes or other
usual statutory deduction.
139.11 WORK SCHEDULES.
   Working hours and days are determined by the Mayor. Work schedules shall be
established according to the needs of the department and may include day,
evening, night and/or weekend hours.
   The workweek is hereby established or shall be defined as from 12:01 a.m.
Monday to 12:00 midnight the following Sunday. Any hours over forty (40)
regular during that period shall be compensated at one and one-half (1½) times
the base pay rate except for employees working in supervisory or salaried
capacity or employees governed by other specific law such as police department
general order or police department general operating standards manual. Any
employee called back out after their regular shift shall be compensated at one
and one-half (1½) the base pay rate, except supervisors or salaried employees.
The hours for holidays, sick leave or vacation leave cannot be used to compute
actual hours worked in regard to overtime pay. Minimum pay for call-out will be
one (1) hour for scheduled and two (2) hours for emergency.
Festival Pay - any city employee that voluntarily agrees to work at a city
sponsored festival will be paid overtime only after they have worked 40 regular
hours. Work at a festival, such as the Potato Festival is not considered call-
out.
   As stated above, holiday, sick or vacation time is not used toward
calculating regular hours worked in regard to overtime.
   When "Workday" is referred to, it means a normal eight (8) hour period,
regardless of the schedules that require more than eight (8) hours per shift.
139.12  GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.
   (a)   Water and Sewer Plants. Initially employed Water and Sewer Plant
employees are all designated as Trainees. Employees of the Water and Sewer
Plant are required to take, and successfully complete the examination to become
Water or Sewer Plant Operators within twenty-four (24) months. All employees
who successfully complete the examination and retain their employment will be
designated as Water and Sewer Plant Operators. Other special training
requirements for Water and Sewer Plant employees are listed in the departmental
policy and procedure manual.
   (b)   Police Department. Police Department employees are subject to a twelve
(12) month training period. During that period all employees must comply with
the listing of training requirements as furnished to the prospective employee
by the department head. During the twelve (12) month period, the employees must
attend and successfully complete the State Police Academy. This requirement can
be waived by the Chief of Police if the employee is certified. Police are also
governed by general orders.
   (c)   Clerical.  Clerical employees will comply with their departmental
policy and procedures.
   (d)   Absenteeism or Tardiness. It is part of everyone's job
responsibilities to be punctual and meet attendance requirements. Each employee
is required to report to his or her Supervisor prior to the employee's starting
time if the employee is going to be late or cannot report for work. Failure to
notify supervision within thirty (30) minutes of the start of the workday
missed shall be considered an unexcused absence and appropriate disciplinary
action will be taken.
   Any employee who is absent from their work duties without prior permission
from their immediate supervisor shall be subject to disciplinary action and
will not be paid for that absence.    The failure of any employee to report for
work for two (2) consecutive work days without notifying supervision or an
employee who fails to return to work upon expiration of a leave of absence will
be considered to have voluntarily resigned.
Good attendance also includes punctuality in reporting to work when scheduled
and returning promptly from meals. Excessive tardiness will result in probation
and/or termination from employment.
   Additional attendance standards and requirements may be utilized in some
programs.
   
   (e)   Reference Checks. Many of COS's supervisors receive calls from
individuals outside the organization for references on current and former
associates. Since there could be legal consequences for both the City and the
supervisor, it is the City's policy that all telephone or written requests for
references be forwarded to the HR Department. The HR Department will verify
whether the individual is a current or former employee, his or her dates of
employment, and the most recent job title. No further information regarding an
individual's employment shall be disclosed.
   (f)   Bulletin Boards.  All employment related notices and activities will
be posted on bulletin boards in conspicuous locations. (City Hall - hallway
outside 2nd floor lunchroom; Police Department - main office area; Street
Department - lunch area; Water Plant - main office area; Sewer Plant - lab;
Utility Maintenance - lunch area.) You should read the postings on these boards
frequently so that you may constantly be informed of all events and pertinent
information. Employees are not permitted to add or remove material from the
City bulletin boards without authorization from management.
   (g)   Solicitation and Distribution.  For the safety of all employees and to
insure an efficient and productive operation, COS does not permit the
collection of funds or solicitation of any kind on working time unless
expressly authorized by management. No distribution of written or printed
material of any description in any working area of the City by any person at
any time is permitted unless expressly authorized by management   
   (h)   Personal Property. COS cannot be responsible for any personal articles
brought on or kept on its premises. Employees are discouraged from bringing any
personal items on City property or other work locations.
139.13 TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT.
   An employee may be terminated from employment at any time with or without
just cause.
139.14 REDUCTION IN FORCE.
   The Mayor shall coordinate and administer any termination(s) resulting from
a decision to reduce the number of employees in the work force.
   Employees may be terminated as a result of economic factors, whether within
a particular program, unit, location, grant or city-wide. Employees may also be
terminated when restructuring the work force to increase efficiency,
effectiveness or productivity in accomplishing service and/or fiscal goals of
the City, or for any reason.
   Employees terminated without cause will receive two (2) weeks written notice
of termination prior to the date of reduction. Equivalent severance pay may be
substituted for prior notice, at the discretion of the Mayor, in cases of
immediate dismissal.
   Should it become necessary to layoff or terminate a regular employee for one
(1) week or more, layoffs will be made in order of least seniority in total
City service with the provision that retained employees are qualified to
perform the available work.
   If it is possible to determine the approximate time and conditions under
which the employee will return to work, he will be so advised.
   No regular full-time employee shall be separated while there are
provisional, probationary or temporary employees serving in the same grade of
positions in the division.
   Except for layoffs of less than one (1) week, full time employees may
request and must be considered for transfer to another department to fill a
position for which they qualify that is held by a less senior employee.
   When it becomes necessary to institute a reduction of work force a
termination form justifying the decision, must be submitted by the supervisor
to the department head of the affected division. The Mayor must approve the
termination.
   Reduction in force decisions will be based upon management discretion as to
which department(s) will be reduced in size or discontinued.
Recall
   All qualified full-time employees on layoff must be recalled for openings
which occur in the City service within ninety (90) days after the layoff, if
qualified to fill the position.
   Recall will be made in reverse order of layoff. Employees will be recalled
as regular employees without having to serve a probationary period.
COMPENSATION
139.15 COMPENSATION PROGRAM.
   COS's compensation program is designed to achieve the following goals:
   •   Ensure fair and consistent pay practices.
   •   Comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
   •   Operate within the constraints of COS's budgetary process and financial
resource limitations.
   •   Ensure administrative efficiency.
   •   Allow COS to offer competitive salaries relative to the labor markets in
which COS recruits.
   COS generally recruits in the local and regional labor market to fill
positions. While pay practices reflect local living costs, they are competitive
with pay practices in the relevant labor market.
   Compensation will be established by the Mayor as allowable in the budget.
139.16 PAY PERIOD.
   The pay period will be every two weeks (bi-weekly). Payday will usually be
on Thursday following the end of the pay period. Should a pay date fall on an
official holiday, payroll checks will be issued the proceeding work day.
139.17 PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.
   Federal and State withholding taxes and Social Security taxes are deducted
from every paycheck. Retirement contributions are deducted from all full-time
employees. Voluntary deductions for health care benefits, supplemental
retirement and the like can be made after an employee completes the necessary
authorization forms.
Non-mandatory deductions will not be withheld through the City payroll unless
approved by the Mayor.
   COS deducts court-ordered garnishments for personal debts - such as child
support - without the employee's prior authorization. Deductions for federal,
state, and city tax liens also can be made by COS without prior employee
authorization.
139.18  TIME SHEET REQUIREMENTS.
   Responsibilities
   Non-Exempt Employees are responsible for making a daily record of their
hours worked and ensuring that such information is accurately presented on
their time sheets. Time sheets must be submitted for all active employees even
if the employee did not work during that pay period.
   Salary/Exempt Employees are not required to document hours worked on a
payroll record sheet however, leave time taken must be reported on an approved
Leave of Absence form.
   All employees must submit the appropriate time sheets to their supervisor by
the prescribed deadline. Employees must submit a timesheet in advance of the
deadline if they plan to be on leave or otherwise out of the office on the day
time sheets are due. An employee on sick leave on the day time sheets are due
generally should telephone his or her supervisor to coordinate the preparation
of a time sheet.
   Supervisors are responsible for training all new hires on how to complete a
time sheet. Supervisors must review time sheets completed by their employees
for completeness and accuracy. Supervisors assure that all reported items are
accurate and correct and they assume responsibility of such. Specific items
supervisors must review include:
   (a)   Mathematical accuracy;
   (b)   Discrepancies with actual hours worked by the employee;
   (c)   Discrepancies with leave authorized by the supervisor during the
period covered by the time sheet;
   Supervisors who will be out of the office on the day time sheets are due
should make arrangements with their immediate supervisor or other individual
designated by that supervisor to assure the supervisor's time sheet duties are
completed during their absence.
   Due Dates
   The HR department makes exceptions related to holidays, but generally is
based on the following sequence of events:
   •   Employees are responsible for submitting time sheets to their
supervisors at the end of each pay period.
   •   Supervisors must ensure that all time sheets are completed and sent to
the HR department.
   •   The HR department must receive time sheets by 10:00 a.m. on Monday
following the pay period.
   •   Paychecks will usually be distributed on Thursday following the two-week
pay period.
   Request for Leave
   Leave time will be approved and documented by the supervisor, on an approved
Leave of Absence form, when taken. This form should be submitted with the
employee time sheet at the end of the pay period.
   Discipline
   The accurate recording of employee's working hours is a serious matter.
Employees who falsify information relating to their working hours are subject
to discipline up to and including termination from employment.
   Employees are responsible for submitting their time sheet by the prescribed
deadline. Supervisors are ultimately responsible for ensuring that all the
employees they supervise submit their time sheet by the prescribed deadline.
Failure to adhere to these deadlines will result in disciplinary action up to
and including termination from employment for each responsible party.
139.19  LOST OR STOLEN PAYCHECKS.
   An employee should report a lost or stolen paycheck to the HR department
immediately. COS will issue a new paycheck to the employee after payment is
stopped on the original check. However, if a check is lost through no fault of
COS and COS is unable to stop payment on the check, COS is not obligated to
indemnify the employee for the loss.
139.20  FINAL WAGE PAYMENT.
   Employees separating from COS are paid for all hours worked and for vacation
earned but not taken as of the last day worked. Payment of amounts due
separating employees are made as follows:
   •   An employee who involuntarily terminates his or her employment with COS
is paid all wages earned within seventy-two (72) hours of the termination
   •   An employee who voluntarily terminates his or her employment with COS is
paid all wages earned no later than the next regularly scheduled payday
following the last day worked by the employee.
   •   In the unfortunate event of an employee's death, COS will pay all wages
earned no later than the next regularly scheduled payday following the last day
worked by the employee.
LEAVE BENEFITS
139.21 VACATION.
   Paid vacation leave is provided to all eligible full-time employees.
   COS shall provide graduated paid vacation time to eligible employees based
upon their most recent length of service with the City. Earned vacation credits
shall be calculated for eligible employees according to the following table:
 
Years of Service    Vacation credit hours per month
0 but less than 2   4 hours
2 but less than 5   6 hours
5 but less than 10  8 hours
10 but less than 15 10 hours
15 and greater   12 hours
   The maximum accumulated is three hundred eighty-four (384) hours during the
fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). Any accumulation upon termination is paid at

department. Request for change must be submitted in writing at least three (3)
working days prior to the anticipated date.
   
   Vacation Credit Carry Over
   Up to 240 hours vacation credit may be carried over for use into the
following year as determined on June 30. Any amount over 240 hours must be used
by the employee prior to June 30; or will be forfeited.

   Salaried employees will not be paid for working on a holiday. However, they
may take equivalent time off from work if working the holiday has the prior
approval of the Mayor
   Only regular full-time employees shall receive any pay for holidays.
Employees must work the day before and the day after a holiday in order to earn
holiday pay, unless on prior approved leave.
139.23 SICK LEAVE.
   Paid sick leave is provided to all eligible full-time employees. The maximum

   COS shall provide graduated paid sick leave time to eligible employees based
upon their most recent length of service with the City. Earned sick leave
credits for employees shall be calculated for eligible employees according to
the following table:
 
Years of Service      Sick leave credit hours per month

a medical absence. Employees returning to work without the attending
physician's statement of condition and limitation will automatically be charged
with a vacation day if available, and if not available the employee will be
charged leave without pay.
   Sick leave can be used until the employee becomes eligible for disability
income insurance, worker's compensation or other income maintenance device that
is the direct result of City employment. Abuse or excessive use of sick leave
is considered gross misconduct and will be grounds for termination from
employment. Sick leave or vacation time may also be used to supplement
disability insurance as defined in separate disability policy.
   Employees shall receive no monetary compensation for accrued but unused sick
leave.
Accrued sick leave may not be appended or added to vacation or holidays to
extend such periods.

used all or some of his or her 30 working days of military leave for guard/
reserve drills, training, etc., shall be entitled to add the number of unused
days from that calendar year to the thirty (30) working days granted pursuant
to W.Va. Code § 15-1F-1(b), up to a maximum of sixty (60) days for a single

eligibility for reinstatement after his or her military duty or training is
completed is also determined in accordance with applicable federal and state
laws.
 
139.26  JURY DUTY.
   As an employer COS recognizes the need to assist employees in fulfilling
their civic responsibilities without loss of pay when required to perform jury
or witness duty.
   If an employee is called to serve as a juror, the COS will pay the
difference between the employee's standard rate of pay and the jury duty fees
received. A copy of the Court Order must be provided to your Supervisor when
requesting time off. If an employee is called to serve as a juror and the Judge
dismisses the jury early, he or she is to return to work for the remainder of

   It is not the policy of COS to attempt to secure any postponement or delay
from the court when an employee is duly summoned to perform jury or witness
duty.
139.27  GENERAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   A leave of absence shall be for a specifically defined length of time and
shall not be granted to employees to seek other employment. A leave of absence

with COS if all terms and conditions of the leave are met.
   Requests for leave of absence must be written and submitted in a timely
fashion to the Mayor. Upon expiration of the leave of absence the employee is
required to report for work his next regularly scheduled workday.
   The COS reserves the right to deny any leave of absence.
139.28  MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   Employees who suffer illness and/or injury that become unable to perform
usual occupational duties for periods exceeding accrued leave, may become
eligible for medical leave without pay or benefits if they are not eligible for
the Family and/or Medical Leave Act. Such leave shall not exceed ninety (90)
days.
   Upon returning to work the employee may be placed back in his or her former
position. However, if that position is not available then he or she shall be
placed in a similar job, if one is available. If a similar job is not
available, then he or she shall be placed in any job at any pay. If no job is
available, then he or she shall be placed on a recall list for a period not to
exceed ninety (90) days.
   COS reserves the right to refer employees for medical examination and/or
evaluation at the City's expense if the relative extent of disability is
questionable in the view of COS.

do not apply. Administrative Regulations of the West Virginia Worker's
Compensation Fund apply.

139.29  FAMILY AND/OR MEDICAL LEAVE.
   An employee who has been employed by the COS for at least twelve (12) months
and has worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of commencement of FMLA
leave, is eligible for FMLA leave.
   An employee will receive up to twelve (12) weeks (or 26 weeks if the reason
for the leave is to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or
illness) of job-protected leave within a twelve (12) month period for the
following: (1) birth and care for a newborn child, if concluded within twelve
(12) months of the birth of the child; (2) placement with the employee of a
child for adoption or foster care, if concluded within twelve (12) months after
placement; (3) care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent (but not
parent-in-law) of the employee who has a serious health condition; (4)
employee's own serious health condition, or (5) military family leave.
Military Family Leave:
 
   Military Caregiver Leave - An eligible employee who is a spouse, son,
daughter, parent, or next of kin of a current member of the Armed Forces
including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, with a serious illness or
injury, may be entitled to up to twenty-six (26) work weeks of unpaid leave
during a single twelve (12) month period to care for the service member.
   Covered service members also include veterans who are undergoing medical
treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness AND who
were members of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or the Reserves,
at any time during the five (5) years preceding the date on which the veteran
undergoes such treatment, recuperation, or therapy.
   With respect to a veteran who was previously a member of the Armed Forces,
Including the National Guard or the Reserves, a "serious injury or illness" is
defined as "a qualifying injury or illness" that was incurred in the line of
duty, or aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty in the
Armed Forces and that manifested itself before or after the individual became a
veteran. Thus, pre-existing conditions aggravated by military service may be
covered.
   Please check with your manager and/or HR for additional information
concerning the definition of a "covered service member" and the definition of a
"serious injury or illness."
   Qualifying Exigency Leave - An eligible employee may be entitled to up to
twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid leave during a single twelve (12) month period
for qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse,
son, daughter, or parent is on "covered active duty." Qualifying exigency leave
is available to a family member of a military member in the regular Armed
Forces, National Guard or Reserves. Qualifying exigencies include leave to
address issues surrounding short-notice deployment, military events and related
activities, childcare and related activities, financial and legal activities,
counseling, rest and recuperation, and post-deployment activities.
   For service members in a regular component of the Armed Forces, "covered
active duty" means duty during deployment to a foreign country. For members of
the National Guard or Reserves, it means deployment to a foreign country under
a call or order to active duty.
   FMLA leave, including military caregiver leave, may be taken all at once,
intermittently, or on a reduced schedule, whenever medically necessary. FMLA
leave may also be taken intermittently for a qualifying exigency arising out of
the active duty status or call to active duty of a covered military member. If
intermittent leave is requested, the employee may be transferred, on a
temporary basis, to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits
which better accommodates the employee's need for such leave.
   An employee must submit a valid certification showing the necessity of the
requested leave and must provide recertification on a reasonable basis as
requested. When leave is needed for planned medical treatment, the employee
must make reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt
the COS's operation.
   When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, an employee is required to give
thirty (30) days written notice, or as much as practical, prior to the
beginning of the leave - generally either the same or the next business day.
The employee must also detail in the written notice why the FMLA leave is being
requested.
   If both spouses are employees of the COS, they may ask to take FMLA leave at
the same time if the purpose of the leave is for the birth and care of a
newborn child, for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care
for a parent who has a serious health condition. However, they will be limited
to a combined total of twelve (12) weeks (or 26 weeks if the reason for the
leave is to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or
illness). Should both employees use only part of the twelve (12) week total
entitlement, the remaining entitlement may be taken individually for other FMLA
purposes, up to the twelve (12) week maximum cumulative. If, however, leave is
requested by both employees/spouses because of one spouse's serious health
condition or to care for a sick child, both employees are entitled to twelve
(12) weeks of FMLA leave.
   The twelve (12) month period within which FMLA is granted will be a fixed
year beginning on the employee's anniversary date. The employee is required to
exhaust any accrued or paid leave (vacation, sick, etc.) during the period of
FMLA leave. Employees will be allowed FMLA leave until the total number of
weeks of the leave equals twelve (12) weeks (or 26 weeks if the reason for the
leave is to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or
illness).
   Any medical leave under FMLA leave will run concurrent with worker's
compensation leave and/or any other disability leave. The FMLA leave period
will be unpaid leave, with the exception of any accrued sick and/or annual
leave which the employee will be required to exhaust.
   Upon returning to work, the employee will be placed in his or her previous
position or an equivalent position without loss of benefits accrued prior to
the leave unless the employee would have been laid off or otherwise terminated
had he or she continued to work during the leave period. "Key employees" who
are notified of that status at the time leave is requested may be denied the
right to return to work to prevent substantial economic injury to us. A "key
employee" is one who is among the highest paid ten percent (10%) of employees
within seventy-five (75) miles of the work site.
   Employee group health benefits, if given, will be granted throughout the
FMLA leave. Employees will be required to pay his or her portion, if any, of
the premium when due.

base hourly pay or salary with a maximum monthly benefit of three thousand
($3,000) beginning on the ninety-first (91st) day of sickness or injury. This

   This policy is designed to bring problem solutions to light and identify
corrective action. The COS has designed the following steps in addressing
conduct or performance problems. These steps, however, are not binding on the
City and immediate action in the form of written notice, probation, final
warning or termination from employment can be taken at the City's sole
discretion and option at any time.
   (a)   Discussion: The immediate supervisor may meet with the employee to
review any problems in performance or conduct. All issues will be attempted to
be resolved at this level.
   (b)   Written Notice: Will address a repeated problem in conduct or
performance. Corrective action will be addressed and a time frame for
correction established. This written notice will be forwarded to the HR
Department for the employee's file.
   (c)   Probation:  This action will be taken in writing to address major
violations of performance, conduct or policy. This period of probation shall
not exceed ninety (90) days and must clearly state the corrective action
expected of the employee. This written notice will be signed by the supervisor
and the employee and maintained in the HR Department. If, while on probation,
the employee fails to show satisfactory improvement within a reasonable period
of time, termination from employment may result.
   (d)   Termination from employment: When the employee fails to meet the
standards as established in the discipline process, or is in flagrant disregard
of policies and procedures, involuntary termination may be affected
immediately.
   (e)   Demotion: An employee may be demoted for inefficiency, or a failure to
satisfactorily perform assigned duties, to a position for which he or she meets
the minimum requirements. Rate of compensation will be commensurate with the
job assignment.
139.49  RESOLVING EMPLOYEE CONCERNS.
   Good employee-employer relationships can only exist if employees believe
they have been treated equitably and fairly within management policies,
procedures and actions that influence this relationship. It is recognized that
there are occasions when honest differences of opinion can occur regarding the
interpretation and application of policies, procedures and actions.
   The following procedure is established to provide an effective and
acceptable means for employees to bring problems and complaints to the
attention of management.
Procedure:
   •   Step 1 - Employee discusses the complaint or problem with their
immediate supervisor. It is expected that every effort will be made to resolve
the complaint in a fair and amicable manner at this level.
   •   Step 2 - If the employee is not satisfied with this attempt to resolve
the complaint or a response (written or oral) is not received within ten (10)
working days, the employee may discuss the matter with the HR Department.
   •   Step 3 - If the problem still has not been resolved to the employee's
satisfaction within another ten (10) days at the second level, a formal written
complaint may be directed to the Mayor. A determination by the Mayor is final.
   It is understood that any employee who elects to use this procedure will be
treated courteously and that the case will be handled confidentially at all
times. An employee will not be subject to discourteous action or reproach in
any form due to use of this procedure, unless investigation reveals the
employee falsified or misrepresented the facts leading to the complaint.
   A complaint documentation file will not become part of an employee's regular
personnel file. Complaint documentation will be maintained in a separate file
and used only as a basis for recommending changes in management procedures.
   Only those members of management with a need to know and who are in the
employee's chain of command may have access to complaint procedure
documentation.
139.50 RESIGNATION.
   All employees shall give not less than two (2) weeks prior written notice of
resignation to the Mayor.
GENERAL POLICIES
139.51 DRESS AND APPEARANCE.
   It is the responsibility of every employee to act and present themselves in
a professional manner, regardless of the type and nature of their work. It is
important that business attire be neat, clean and appropriately reflect
professionalism. Our public image is directly dependent on our staff,
individually and collectively. People are inclined to judge organizations by
the people who represent them. The personal appearance, quality of service and
positive attitude of all our employees are essential to creating and
maintaining a favorable public image.
   Employees are expected to dress in a manner appropriate to the job they
perform and in consideration of: (1) the fact that the open work environment
gives high public visibility to all employees; (2) safety issues; (3) the
importance that some staff serve as role models.
   It is required that uniforms be worn at all times by police and public works
departments while on their regular shifts, except for department heads or as
deferred by the Mayor. Uniforms are provided and paid for by the City. Uniforms
are to be worn only while on duty performing city tasks.
   Supervisors will provide employees with a dress code policy specific to
their department.
   Supervisors are responsible for interpreting and enforcing the dress and
appearance code in their area of responsibility. This includes counseling and/
or disciplinary action for employees whose appearance is inappropriate.
139.52 GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.
   It is also important that our building and workstations reflect a
professional image. Adhering to housekeeping policies will demonstrate to our
clients and visitors a sense of personal pride we all have in our City.
Whatever area you may work in, you are responsible to do your part in keeping
our work and rest areas as clean, neat, and organized as possible.
139.53  OFFICE DECORUM.
   We ask that you not disturb other employees while they are working and give
us a full day of work. Interruptions include, but are not limited to, personal
cell phone use/texting, loudly playing radios, idle chatter and gossiping. If
you are caught up on your work, anticipate what you might do today that you
planned to do tomorrow, then do it, or help other employees should they be
falling behind in their work.
139.54  SMOKING AND USE OF SMOKELESS TOBACCO.
   The COS is committed to providing its employees with a comfortable working
environment. Due to the increasing evidence of the dangers of tobacco smoke and
smokeless tobacco, employees are encouraged not to smoke or use smokeless
tobacco.
   The COS recognizes, however, that the decision is a personal one. While the
COS does not wish to interfere with that decision, it does want to protect
those who have chosen not to smoke. Therefore, smoking is restricted to
specific areas designated by management.
   All enclosed areas are designated as "NO SMOKING" areas and signs will be
posted accordingly. Employees can smoke only in designated smoking areas
outdoors. There is absolutely no smoking or using smokeless tobacco in
restrooms, elevators, hallways, offices or stairways. Smoking in COS vehicles
is prohibited.
139.55 OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE.
   Offensive language is never appropriate in the work place. You should show
your fellow employees the type of consideration that you would expect to be
shown.
139.56 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   It is illegal and against COS policy for any employee, male or female, to
harass another employee in the following manner:
   1.    Make unwelcome sexual advances, favors, or other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature a condition of any employee's employment;
   2.    Use an employee's submission to or rejection of such harassing conduct
as the basis for or as a factor in any employment decision affecting the
individual;
   3.    Make offensive or inappropriate comments or engage in other harassing
conduct due to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, ancestry,
disability, or veteran status; or
   4.    Otherwise create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work
environment by engaging in harassing conduct.
   Inappropriate conduct in the workplace that may rise to the level of sexual,
illegal or discriminatory harassment includes, but is not limited to, the
following:
   •   Demanding sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment,
assignments, promotions, continued employment, or promises of the same.
   •   Verbal: Repeated sexual innuendo, sexual epithets, name calling,
degrading vulgar words or slurs, off-color jokes, advances or propositions,
flirtations, threats, whistling, or suggestive insulting sounds.
   •   Graphic verbal commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess, or
the lack thereof.
   •   Visual: Suggestive objects or pictures, adult gag gifts, sexual posters,
drawings, displays of graffiti, obscene letters, notes, photographs, cartoons,
articles, or other pictorial materials of a sexual nature, graphic
commentaries, leering, or obscene gestures.
   •   Physical: Unwanted physical contact, including touching, brushing the
body, rubbing, grabbing, pinching, caressing, coerced interference with an
individual's normal work movement, or assault.
   •   Threats or Retaliation: Making or threatening reprisals as a result of a
negative response to harassment.
 
   •   Using company computers, cell phones, facsimiles, e-mail, or any other
electronic equipment for the viewing or sending of any type of sexually
explicit or offensive material.
   COS will not condone nor permit any illegal harassment of its employees. All
employees, supervisors, and managers will be subject to severe discipline, up
to and including discharge, for any act of illegal harassment they commit.
   Employees must not allow an inappropriate situation to continue without
reporting it, regardless of who is creating the situation. No employee is
exempt from this policy. Any employee that is being illegally harassed must
immediately tell the harasser to stop such conduct.
   An employee that believes he or she has been subjected to objectionable
conduct must report the matter immediately and in writing to the HR Manager for
investigation. If an employee is not comfortable reporting the matter to the HR
Manager, then the matter should be reported in writing to the Mayor. COS will
take appropriate corrective action where necessary.
   Each member of management is responsible for creating an atmosphere free of
discrimination and illegal harassment, sexual or otherwise. No employee will be
subjected to any form of retaliation or discipline for pursuing a legitimate
illegal harassment complaint or participating in the investigation of the same.
However, if after investigating any complaint of illegal harassment or unlawful
discrimination, it is determined that the complaint was not filed in good faith
or that an employee has provided false information during the investigation of
a complaint, disciplinary action may be taken against that employee, up to and
including termination from employment.
139.57  DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   COS is committed to maintaining a drug free workplace. The following policy
is designed to help ensure a safe, healthy, and more productive workplace for
all employees.
    1.   The unlawful use, possession, manufacture, distribution, sale or
dispensation of controlled or illegal substances on COS premises, in City owned

written statement from their doctor.
   5.   Any use, possession, manufacturing, distribution, sale, or dispensation
of illegal drugs off premises and off COS time that adversely affect the
individual's work performance, his or her own or others' safety at work, or the
City's reputation in the community is absolutely prohibited.
   6.   Employees must report to the Mayor any conviction under a criminal drug
statute for violations occurring on or off COS property, if the violation
occurred while conducting City business. A report of a conviction, including
pleas of nolo contendere (i.e., no contest), must be made within five (5) days
of such conviction or plea. This requirement is mandated by the Drug-Free
Workplace Act.
   7.   Employees needing help in dealing with alcohol or drug-related problems
are encouraged to use assistance programs and health insurance plans as
appropriate.
   8.   Failure to adhere to the requirements of any drug treatment or
counseling program in which the employee is enrolled is grounds for
disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment.
   9.   Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and
including discharge, and may have legal consequences.
   COS reserves the right to require employees to undergo appropriate tests to
detect the presence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or other controlled substances
where it has reasonable suspicion that an employee may be under the influence
of any of these substances. Refusal to consent to such a test may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
139.58  COMPUTER/ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS/SOCIAL MEDIA.
   All COS computer and electronic communication systems (i.e., computers,
email, voice mail, Internet, intranet, telephones, cell phones, text messaging,
fax machines, cameras, video systems, wire services, etc.) are COS property and
can be used only for work-related purposes. Further, all information
transmitted by, received from, or stored in such computer and electronic
communication system is COS property.
    All COS computer and electronic communication systems are provided to
assist employees with performing their job duties. Therefore, employees have no
expectation of privacy in anything they create, store, send, or receive on any
COS computer or electronic communication system.
      Employees using the COS computer or electronic communication systems are
not to waste these resources. This includes, but is not limited to, sending
mass mailings or chain letters, playing games, "surfing the net," engaging in
online chat groups, unnecessarily printing multiple copies of documents, or
otherwise creating unnecessary networking traffic. Employees are not to use any
COS computer or electronic communication system to access Facebook, Myspace,
Twitter, or any other personal social networking or communication page or
account.
    The COS recognizes that participation in some forums may be necessary in
the performance of an employee's job. For example, employees may find answers
to technical problems by consulting members of a news group devoted to that
technical area. Participation in such online forums must be for work only.
      The COS retains the right to monitor all aspects of its computer and
electronic communication systems including, but not limited to, monitoring
sites visited by employees on the Internet, monitoring chat and news groups,
reviewing material downloaded or uploaded by Internet users, reviewing e-mails
sent or received by users, and reviewing voice mail and text messages. The COS
expressly retains the right to monitor, retrieve, and delete anything stored,
created, received, or sent through its computer or electronic media systems
without seeking the permission of the employee.
   Employees are not to use a code, access a file, or retrieve any stored
communication unless specifically authorized to do so. No unauthorized software
or application is to be loaded onto any COS computer or electronic
communication system. Further, employees should not attempt to gain access to
another employee's e-mail, Internet, or voice mail/text message files without
the latter's express permission.
    Employees can only use encryption software supplied to them by the system
administrator for purposes of safeguarding sensitive or confidential business
information. Employees who use encryption on files stored in a COS computer
must provide their supervisor with a sealed hard copy record (to be retained in
a secured location) of all passwords and/or encryption keys necessary to access
the files.
    The COS computer and electronic communication systems are not to be used in
any way that is disruptive or offensive to others, or in ways that could be
harmful to workplace morale. Further, there is to be no display or transmission
of sexually explicit images, messages or cartoons, or any transmission or use
of such communications containing ethnic slurs, racial epithets, or anything
that may be construed as offensive, harassing, or disparaging to others based
on their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, disability,
veteran status, or any other status protected by law.
    The COS computer and electronic communication systems are not to be used to
solicit others for commercial purposes, religious and political causes, or for
any other solicitations that are not work-related.
    No employee may use COS facilities or computer and electronic communication
systems to knowingly download or distribute pirated software or data. Any
software or files downloaded via COS computer or electronic communication
systems may only be used in ways that are consistent with their licenses or
copyrights.
    The COS computer and electronic communication systems must not be used to
knowingly violate the laws and regulations of the United States or the laws and
regulations of any state, city, province, or local jurisdiction in any material
way. Further, these computer and electronic communication systems must not be
used to inappropriately disclose any information that is confidential or
proprietary to the COS or to any third party that has disclosed information to
the COS.
    Any employee using the COS computer or electronic communication systems
shall identify themselves honestly, accurately, and completely when
corresponding or participating in interactive activities.
    The COS assumes no responsibility or liability for an employee's misuse of
its computer or electronic communication systems. However, the COS reserves the
right to immediately terminate any employee for improper use of such computer
or electronic communication systems.    Nothing in this policy is intended to
prohibit or inhibit employees from discussing terms and conditions of
employment under the concerted activity protections of the National Labor
Relations Act. However, the COS has established certain limitations regarding
the use of any multi-media, social networking websites, blogs, or other forms
of social media, regardless of whether such use is for personal or professional
use. With that in mind, employees are hereby notified that:
    1.   Internet or electronic postings must not inappropriately disclose any
information that is confidential or proprietary to the COS to any third party
that has disclosed information to the COS.
    2.   If an employee comments on any aspect of the COS business, they must
clearly identify themselves as an employee and include a disclaimer such as
"the views expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of
the COS.
    3.   Internet or electronic postings should not include any COS logos or
trademarks without the permission of the COS;
    4.   Internet or electronic postings must respect all applicable laws;
    5.   Employees should neither claim nor imply that they are speaking on

violation of this policy must immediately report the matter to their immediate
Supervisor or the Mayor. Further, employees are hereby reminded that any
violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action up to and including
termination from employment.
Violations of this policy may in some instances lead to legal action and
criminal liability.

expected to follow all applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and
policies relating to the use of cell phones.
    The COS reserves the right to monitor the use of any agency-issued cell
phone for possible misuse.

employee's misuse of these phones. However, it does reserve the right to
terminate an employee immediately for improper use of a City cell phone. Use of
City cell phones can be taken away at any time deemed appropriate by
management. City cell phones are to be turned in immediately following

139.60 RECORDING DEVICES IN THE WORKPLACE.
   Except as otherwise provided for in this policy, no employee may photograph,
tape, or otherwise record any person, document, conversation, communication, or
activity that in any way involves the City or employees of the City, any client
or any other individual with whom the City is doing business or intending to do
business in any capacity (for example vendors, suppliers, consultants,
attorneys, or independent contractors). The authorized copying of documents in
the ordinary course of business for the benefit of the company is not
prohibited by this policy.
   "Photographing," "taping," and "recording" under this policy, includes
taking still or video pictures (film or digital) or recording any conversation
or communications, regardless of whether the conversation or communication
takes place in person, over the telephone, or via any other communications
device or equipment, and regardless of the method used to tape or record (for
example, tape recorder, video recorder, mechanical recording, or wiretapping
equipment), and regardless of where the conversation or communication takes
place (i.e., on or off the company's premises). "Taping" or "recording" also
include photographing or recording digital images through cameras of any kind
(for example, camera phones or concealed cameras). Limited exceptions will
apply where the photographing, taping, or recording is being conducted by an
individual who has been provided advance written authorization for the activity
by an authorized member of management.
    Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action against the
offending employee(s), up to and including discharge. Where the conduct engaged
in was illegal, violators may also be subject to prosecution under applicable
federal, state or local laws.
   
139.61 USE OF COS EQUIPMENT AND PROPERTY.
   The COS provides equipment and property necessary for you to perform your
job. Unless otherwise specified, these items are to be used solely for City
purposes. Employees are expected to exercise care in the use of City equipment
and property and to use such property only for authorized purposes. Loss,
damages, or theft of City property should be reported immediately. Negligence

of the Mayor. The City reserves the right to define "materials" in specific
instances but, in general, materials that do not belong to you must be left on
the premises.
   Falsification of your time cards and misuse of your time at work shall also
be considered theft. Employees are not paid just to be in the building; they
paid to work and produce results.    Because the City's desire to prevent and
detect theft, your terms and conditions of employment include polygraph testing
when theft is suspected, routine searches of the workplace and electronic
surveillance.
   Theft in whatever form is grounds for immediate termination from employment
and may result in prosecution.

303.09 TRAFFIC SCHOOL.
   (a)   Purpose; Fee. The purpose of this School is to allow those persons who

lieu of pleading guilty or in lieu or having a trial on the charges. (See
Traffic School Guidelines.)
   A one hundred sixty-two dollar ($162.00) administrative fee will be charged
to each person attending Traffic School. Any fee charged by the instructor must
be paid to the instructor prior to beginning the class.
   This program is under the guidance of the Chief of Police.
   (b)   Guidelines. The Mayor, Chief of Police and the Municipal Prosecuting
Attorney of the City are pleased to announce the formation of a Traffic School.
   The purpose of this school is to allow those persons who have been cited for
minor moving violations to attend Traffic School in lieu of pleading guilty or
in lieu of having a trial on the charges. Traffic School will be completely
voluntary and is in no way intended to deny anyone their right to trial.
   Beginning September 12, 1994, any person charged with a minor traffic
offense as defined below will have four choices available: guilty, not guilty,
nolo contendere (with the consent of the Court), or Traffic School. If the
person’s choice is Traffic School, the person will be charged an administrative
fee of one hundred sixty-two dollars ($162.00) to attend. The administrative
fee must be paid in full prior to beginning the class. Upon satisfactory
completion of Traffic School, the citation will be placed on open docket and
expire. Thus, a person who successfully completes Traffic School will not incur
any Department of Motor Vehicle points on their operator’s license or have a
record of the citation with the Department of Motor Vehicles.
   The Traffic School curriculum will include both a knowledge pre-test and
post-test to assist the City in evaluating the effectiveness of the course.
Traffic School will include instruction in basic traffic laws, defensive
driving, hazard recognition, reactions, traffic safety and courteous driving.
   Persons electing Traffic School will be required to attend one session of
Traffic School, lasting approximately two to three hours. At the completion of
Traffic School, the instructor will provide the attendee with evidence of
satisfactory completion of the course. The person will then show either the
Municipal Judge or his/her clerk such evidence and the charge will be placed on
open docket. Traffic School must, in any event, be completed within sixty days
of the day Traffic School is chosen, unless special permission is received from
the Municipal Judge. The place, date and times of traffic class will be posted
on the bulletin board at the City Hall and the Police Department.
   The offenses to which a person may elect Traffic School generally include
any offense that would carry three or less points upon conviction, for example,
running a red light, running a stop sign, speeding and similar offenses.
Traffic School will not be available for the following offenses: school zone
offense, reckless driving, driving under the influence, vehicular homicide, or
in any case in which there was an accident. There may be exceptions to this.
   Traffic School is not intended for repeat offenders. However, with the
consent of the officer who issued the citation, a person may repeat Traffic
School for a subsequent offense if more than two years have elapsed since the
issuance of the citation to which Traffic School was previously elected.
   Any questions concerning Traffic School may be directed to the Clerk of the
Municipal Court, the City Attorney or the Chief of Police.
   This public notice has set forth the general guidelines of the Traffic
School program. The Judge of the Municipal Court may, in his discretion, alter
or modify these guidelines in an individual case.

   Whoever violates any provision of this Traffic Code for which another
penalty is not provided shall, for a first conviction thereof, be fined not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisoned not more than ten days;

twenty days, or both; and upon a third or subsequent conviction such person

provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.

313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)

until the person’s 21st birthday, whichever period is longer, or for a period
of time conditioned on participation in the test and lock program in accordance
with West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. A person who is charged with a first offense
under the provisions of this subsection may move for a continuance of the
proceedings, from time to time, to allow the person to participate in the test
and lock program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Upon successful
completion of the program, the court shall dismiss the charge against the
person and expunge the person’s record as it relates to the alleged offense. In
the event the person fails to successfully complete the program, the court
shall proceed to an adjudication of the alleged offense. A motion for a
continuance under this subsection may not be construed as an admission or be
used as evidence.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of this subsection, a person
shall have his or her license to operate a motor vehicle suspended or revoked
for a minimum period of one year or for a period of time conditioned on
participation in the test and lock program in accordance with West Virginia
Code 17C-5A-3a, if the person:
            (i)   Has previously been convicted under this subsection and is
subsequently convicted of an offense under another subsection of this section;
or
            (ii)   Is convicted under this subsection and has previously been
convicted of an offense under another subsection of this section.
         B.   Nothing in this subdivision permits a shorter period of license
revocation, license suspension, or participation in the test and lock program
than is mandatory for the specific offense for which the person is convicted.
      (3)   A person arrested and charged with an offense under the provisions
of this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this
section may not also be charged with an offense under this subsection arising
out of the same transaction or occurrence.
   (i)   Any person who drives a vehicle on any public highway or private road
in this state while he or she is in an impaired state and has within the
vehicle one or more persons who are unemancipated minors who have not yet
reached their 16th birthday is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be confined in jail for not less than two days nor more than
twelve months, and shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00)
nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), and shall have his or her license
to operate a motor vehicle revoked by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor
Vehicles for a period of one year or for a period of time conditioned on
participation in the test and lock program in accordance with West Virginia
Code 17C-5A-3a: provided, that such jail term shall include actual confinement
of not less than forty-eight hours: provided, however, that a person sentenced
pursuant to this subsection shall receive credit for any period of actual
confinement he or she served upon arrest for the subject offense.
   (j)   A person convicted of an offense under this section who has previously
been convicted of any offense under this section on one occasion, is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail for not
less than six months nor more than one year may be fined not less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than three thousand dollars ($3,000) and
shall have his or her license to operate a motor vehicle revoked by the
Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles for ten years or for a period of
time conditioned on participation in the test and lock program in accordance
with West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a: provided, that if the second conviction is
for an offense as described in subsection (b) of this section and the
subsection creating the offense requires a period of incarceration, period of
license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e), (f) or (g), of this section, or under a prior enactment of this section,
for an offense which occurred within the 10-year period immediately preceding
the date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)   Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this state or any
other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an
offense which has the same elements as an offense described in subsection (b),
(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this section, which offense occurred within the
10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b for violation of subsection (c) of this section, which
violation occurred within the 10-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant, indictment, or information for a
second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11A-
1 et seq. to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for
a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.
   (o)   A person whose license to operate a motor vehicle has been revoked or
suspended by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to
this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.
(WVaC 17C-5-2)
333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
 333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision
of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)    If the person holders a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicles;
      (3)    If the person has previously had his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (h)   A person prosecuted for an offense under Section
333.01(c), whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this
section, shall be required to pay the amount of court costs that could be
assessed against a person convicted of the offense. Payment of such costs may
be made a condition of probation. The costs assessed pursuant to this
subsection, whether as a term of probation or not, shall be distributed as
other court costs in accordance with West Virginia Code 50-3-2; 14-2A-4; 30-29-
4; and 62-5-2, 62-5-7 and 62-5-10.
(WVaC 17C-5-2b)
333.02 RECKLESS DRIVING.
   (a)   No person shall drive any vehicle upon any street or highway, or upon
any residential street, or in any parking area, or upon the ways of any
institution of higher education, whether public or private or upon the property
of the Board of Education, or upon any property within the Municipal park and
public recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of
persons or property.
   (b)   The provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to those areas
which have been temporarily closed for racing sport events or which may be set
aside by the Municipality within the park and recreation system for exclusive
use by motorcycles or other recreational vehicles. (WVaC 17C-5-3)

333.04 IMPLIED CONSENT TO TEST; ADMINISTRATION AT DIRECTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER.
   (a)    Any person who drives a motor vehicle in this Municipality shall be
deemed to have given his consent by the operation thereof, subject to the
provisions of this article, to a preliminary breath analysis and a secondary
chemical test of either his blood, breath or urine for the purposes of
determining the alcoholic content of his blood. A preliminary breath analysis
may be administered in accordance with the provisions of Section
333.05 whenever a law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe a
person to have committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01 of this article. A secondary test of blood, breath or urine shall be
incidental to a lawful arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the
arresting law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person to have committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01 of this article. The law enforcement agency by which such law
enforcement officer is employed shall designate which one of the aforesaid
secondary tests shall be administered: provided, that if the test so designated
is a blood test and the person so arrested refuses to submit to such blood
test, then the law enforcement officer making such arrest shall designate in
lieu thereof, either a breath or urine test to be administered, and
notwithstanding the provisions of Section
333.07, such refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the
revocation of the arrested person's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
State. Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is then
arrested shall be given a written statement advising him that his refusal to
submit to the secondary chemical test finally designated as provided in this
section, will result in the revocation of his license to operate a motor
vehicle in this State for a period of at least one year and up to life.
   (b)    For the purposes of this article, "law enforcement officer" or
"police officer" shall mean and be limited to:
      (1)    Any member of the Department of Public Safety of this State,
      (2)    Any sheriff and any deputy sheriff of any county,
      (3)    Any member of a police department in any municipality as defined
in section two [8-1-2], article one, chapter eight of the W.Va. Code and
      (4)    Any conservation officer of the Department of Natural Resources.
   If this municipality does not have available to its law enforcement officers
the testing equipment or facilities necessary to conduct any secondary test
which a law enforcement officer may administer under this article, any member
of the Department of Public Safety, the sheriff of the county wherein the
arrest is made or any deputy or such sheriff or any municipal law enforcement
officer of another municipality within the county wherein the arrest is made
may, upon the request of such arresting law enforcement officer and in his
presence, conduct such secondary test and the results of such test may be used
in evidence to the same extent and in the same manner as if such test had been
conducted by such arresting law enforcement officer. Only the person actually
administering or conducting such test shall be competent to testify as to the
results and the veracity of such test. (WVaC 17C-5-4)
333.05 PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF BREATH TO DETERMINE ALCOHOLIC CONTENT OF BLOOD.
   When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe a person has committed
an offense prohibited by Section
333.01 of this article, the law enforcement officer may require such person to
submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining such
person’s blood alcohol content. Such breath analysis must be administered as
soon as possible after the law enforcement officer has a reasonable belief that
the person has been driving while under the influence of alcohol, controlled
substances or drugs. Any preliminary breath analysis required under this
section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the
Department of Health for that purpose. The results of a preliminary breath
analysis shall be used solely for the purpose of guiding the officer in
deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested following
a preliminary breath analysis, the tests as hereinafter provided in this
article shall be administered in accordance with the provisions thereof. (WVaC
17C-5-5)
333.06 HOW BLOOD TEST ADMINISTERED; ADDITIONAL TEST; USE OF RESULTS; IMMUNITY
FROM LIABILITY.
   Only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained
medical technician at the place of his employment, acting at the request and
direction of the law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining the alcoholic content thereof. These limitations shall not apply to
the taking of a breath test or a urine specimen. In withdrawing blood for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof, only a previously unused
and sterile needle and sterile vessel may be utilized and the withdrawal shall
otherwise be in strict accord with accepted medical practices. A nonalcoholic
antiseptic shall be used for cleansing the skin prior to venapuncture. The
person tested may, at his own expense, have a doctor of medicine or osteopathy,
or registered nurse, or trained medical technician at the place of his
employment, of his own choosing, administer a chemical test in addition to the
test administered at the direction of the law enforcement officer. Upon the
request of the person who is tested, full information concerning the test taken
at the direction of the law enforcement officer shall be made available to him.
No person who administers any such test upon the request of a law enforcement
officer as herein defined, no hospital in or with which such person is employed
or is otherwise associated, or in which such test is administered, and no other
person, firm or corporation by whom or with which such person is employed or is
in any way associated shall be in anywise criminally liable for the
administration of such test, or civilly liable in damages to the person tested
unless for gross negligence or willful or wanton injury.
(WVaC 17C-5-6)
333.07 REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTS; REVOCATION OF LICENSE OR PRIVILEGE; CONSENT
NOT WITHDRAWN; HEARING.
   (a)    If any person under arrest as specified in 17C-5-4 of the W.Va. State
Code refuses to submit to any secondary chemical test, the tests shall not be
given: provided, that prior to such refusal, the person is given a written
statement advising him that his refusal to submit to the secondary test finally
designated will result in the revocation of his license to operate a motor
vehicle in this State for a period of at least one year and up to life. If a
person initially refuses to submit to the designated secondary chemical test
after being informed in writing of the consequences of such refusal, he shall
be informed orally and in writing that the after fifteen minutes said refusal
shall be deemed to be final and the arresting officer shall after said period
of time expires have no further duty to provide the person with an opportunity
to take the secondary test. The officer shall within forty-eight hours of such
refusal, sign and submit to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a written
statement of the officer that:
      (1)    He had reasonable grounds to believe such person had been driving
a motor vehicle in this Municipality while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (2)    Such person was lawfully placed under arrest for an offense
relating to driving a motor vehicle in this Municipality while under the
influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs;
      (3)    Such person refused to submit to the secondary chemical test
finally designated in the manner provided in Section
333.04; and
      (4)    Such person was given a written statement advising him that his
license to operate a motor vehicle in this State would be revoked for a period
of at least one year and up to life if he refused to submit to the secondary
test finally designated in the manner provided in Section
333.04.
   The signing of the statement required to be signed by this section shall
constitute an oath or affirmation by the person signing such statement that the
statements contained therein are true and that any copy filed is a true copy.
Such statement shall contain upon its face a warning to the officer signing
that to willfully sign a statement containing false information concerning any
matter or thing, material, or not material, is false swearing and is a
misdemeanor.
   (b)    Any person who is unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering him incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn his
consent for a test of his blood, breath or urine as provided in Section
333.04 and the test may be administered although such person is not informed
that his failure to submit to the test will result in the revocation of his
license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for the period provided for in
this section.
333.08 INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this Municipality
while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon
the trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol
in the person's blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged as shown
by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine, is admissible, if
the sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after the time of
arrest or of the acts alleged and shall give rise to the following presumptions
or have the following effect:
   (a)    Evidence that there was, at that time, five hundredths of one percent
or less, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
   (b)    Evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of
one percent and less than ten hundredths of one percent, by weight, of alcohol
in the person's blood shall be relevant evidence, but it is not to be given
prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under the influence of
alcohol.
   (c)    Evidence that there was, at that time, ten hundredths of one percent
or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be admitted as prima
facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood shall be
based upon a formula of:
      (1)    The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters
of blood,
      (2)    The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath, or
      (3)    The number of grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of
urine.
   A chemical analysis of a person's blood, breath or urine, in order to give
rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in subdivisions
(a), (b) and (c) of this section must be performed in accordance with methods
and standards approved by the State Department of Health. A chemical analysis
of blood or urine to determine the alcoholic content of blood shall be
conducted by a qualified laboratory or by the State Police Scientific
Laboratory of the Criminal Identification Bureau of the Division of Public
Safety.
   The provisions of this article shall not limit the introduction in any
judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing on the question of
whether the person was under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or
drugs.
333.09 RIGHT TO DEMAND TEST.
   Any person lawfully arrested for driving a motor vehicle in this
Municipality while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or
drugs shall have the right to demand that a sample or specimen of his blood,
breath or urine be taken within two hours from and after the time of arrest,
and that a chemical test thereof be made. The analysis disclosed by such
chemical test shall be made available to such arrested person forthwith upon
demand.
(WVaC 17C-5-9)
333.10 FEE FOR WITHDRAWING BLOOD SAMPLE AND MAKING URINE TEST; PAYMENT OF FEES.
   A reasonable fee shall be allowed to the person withdrawing a blood sample
or administering a urine test at the request and direction of a law enforcement
officer in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the person whose
blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged
with a violation of Section
333.01, the Municipality shall pay said fee, and if said person is subsequently
convicted of such charge, such fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the
criminal proceeding and shall be paid, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Code to the contrary, into the General Fund of the Municipality.
(WVaC 17C-5-10)
333.11 IMPLIED CONSENT TO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Any person who is licensed to operate a motor vehicle in this State
and who drives a motor vehicle in this Municipality shall be deemed to have
given his consent by the operation thereof, subject to the provisions of this
article, to the procedure set forth in this article for the determination of
whether his license to operate a motor vehicle in this State should be revoked
because he did drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs, or combined influence of alcohol or controlled
substances or drugs, or did drive a motor vehicle while having an alcoholic
concentration in his blood of ten hundredths of one percent or more, by weight,
or did refuse to submit to any designated secondary chemical test.
   (b)    Any law enforcement officer arresting a person for an offense
described in Section
333.01 shall take the person's license at the time of arrest and issue a
temporary license, to be prescribed by the Department of Motor Vehicles,
pending a request for an administrative hearing, and shall report to the
Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles by written statement within
forty-eight hours the name and address of the person so arrested. Such report
shall include the specific offense with which the person is charged, and, if
applicable, a copy of the results of any secondary tests of blood, breath or
urine. The signing of the statement required to be signed by this subsection
shall constitute an oath or affirmation by the person signing such statement
that the statements contained therein are true and that any copy filed is a
true copy. Such statement shall contain upon its face a warning to the officer
signing that to willfully sign a statement containing false information
concerning any matter or thing, material or not material, is false swearing and
is a misdemeanor.
333.12 REPORTING.
   (a)    If a conviction for an offense defined in Section
333.01 is the judgment of a Municipal Court Judge, the Clerk or Recorder shall
forward such transcript when the person convicted has not perfected an appeal
within ten days from and after the date upon which the sentence is imposed.
   (b)    For the purposes of this section, a person is convicted when such
person enters a plea of guilty or is found guilty by a court or jury.
333.13 TAKING A CHILD INTO CUSTODY; DRIVING A MOTOR VEHICLE WITH ANY AMOUNT OF
BLOOD ALCOHOL.
   (a)    A preliminary breath analysis may be administered to a child whenever
a law enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe the child to have
been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood,
for the purpose of determining the child's blood alcohol content. Such breath
analysis must be administered as soon as possible after the law enforcement
officer arrives at a reasonable belief that the child has been driving a motor
vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood. Any preliminary breath
analysis administered pursuant to this subsection must be administered with a
device and in a manner approved by the Division of Health for that purpose. If
a preliminary breath analysis is administered, the results shall be used solely
for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether the child, at the
time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her
blood of two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, and should therefore
be taken into custody to administer a secondary test in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
   (b)    A child may be taken into custody by a law enforcement official
without a warrant or court order if the official has reasonable grounds to
believe the child to have been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of
alcohol in his or her blood. If a preliminary breath analysis is administered
and the results of the analysis indicate that the child has an alcohol
concentration in his or her blood of less than two hundredths of one percent,
by weight, the child may not be taken into custody unless other grounds exist
under subsection (b), Section Eight, Article Five, Chapter Forty-Nine of the
West Virginia Code. Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to the provisions
of this section, the official shall take all reasonable steps to cause
notification to be made to the child’s parent or custodian or, if the parent or
custodian cannot be located, to a close relative.
   (c)    Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to this section, the
official shall take the child to a facility where a secondary test of the
child’s blood or urine may be administered at the direction of the official or
a test of the child's breath may be administered by the official. The law
enforcement agency by which such law enforcement official is employed shall
designate whether the secondary test is a test of either blood, breath, or
urine: provided, that if the test so designated is a blood test and the child
refuses to submit to the blood test, then the law enforcement official taking
the child into custody shall designate in lieu thereof a breath test to be
administered.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
333.07, a refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the
revocation of the child’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this
Municipality. Any child taken into custody pursuant to this section shall be
given a written statement advising him or her that a refusal to submit to a
secondary test of either blood, breath or urine: Provided, That if the test so
designated is a blood test and the child refuses to submit to the blood test,
then the law-enforcement official taking the child into custody shall designate
in lieu thereof a breath test to be administered. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section
333.07, a refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the
revocation of the child's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
Municipality. Any child taken into custody pursuant to this section shall be
given a written statement advising him or her that a refusal to submit to a
secondary test of either blood, breath or urine, as finally designated by the
law enforcement agency or official in accordance with this subsection, will
result in the suspension of his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in
this Municipality for a period of at least thirty days or a revocation of the
license for a period up to life.
   (d)    If the law enforcement official taking the child into custody is
employed by a law enforcement agency which does not have available the testing
equipment or facilities necessary to conduct any secondary breath test which
may be administered pursuant to the provisions of these sections, then the
official who took the child into custody may request another qualified person
to administer a secondary breath test: provided, that the breath test shall be
administered in the presence of the official who took the child into custody.
The results of such breath test may be used in evidence to the same extent and
in the same manner as if such test had been conducted by the law enforcement
official who took the child into custody. The qualified person administering
the breath test must be a member of the Division of Public Safety, the sheriff
of the county wherein the child was taken into custody or any deputy of such
sheriff, or a law enforcement official of another municipality within the
county wherein the child was taken into custody. Only the person actually
administering the secondary breath test is competent to testify as to the
results and the veracity of the test. If the secondary test is a blood test,
the test shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section
333.06.
 
   (e)    After taking the child into custody, if the law enforcement official
has reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined
under the provisions of Section
333.01 of this article if the child were an adult, then the official shall
proceed to treat the child in the same manner as any other child taken into
custody without a warrant or court order, in accordance with the provisions of
Section
333.07 of this article.
   (f)    If the results of any secondary test administered pursuant to this
section indicate that the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had
an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of ten hundredths of one percent
or less, by weight, and if the law enforcement official does not have
reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined
under the provisions of Section
333.01 of this article if the child were an adult, then the official shall
release the child: provided, that if the results of any secondary test
administered pursuant to this section indicate that the child, at the time of
driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of
two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, the child shall only be
released to a parent or custodian, or to some other responsible adult.

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who

and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle's license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.

of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

361.07 ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)    Declaration of Public Purpose. The City recognizes and declares that
abandoned vehicles, junked vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or
inoperative household appliances are and constitute a public nuisance and
hazard to both adults and children and therefore are dangerous and constitute a
clear and present danger, that such abandoned vehicles, junked vehicles, old
vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve
as harborage and breeding places for rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, mice,
rats and other insects, pests and flies injurious to the public health, safety
and general welfare; that abandoned vehicles and junked vehicles serve
frequently as temporary or permanent places of human residence unconducive to
public health, safety and welfare; that the accumulation and storage of any of
such items or parts thereof on private or public property, including but not
limited to highways, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce
the value of private property and to promote blight and deterioration which if
permitted to remain will continue to destroy the natural beauty of this City
and have adverse economic and social effects; that such abandoned vehicles,
junked vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative
household appliances constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of all citizens; that such items are nearly always located on
public highways, rights of way, or within sight of such highway rights of way
and on private property within a reasonable proximity thereto, and when so
located the cost of controlling or abating such visual pollution is a cost of
maintenance of public highways; that all such visual pollution is a deterrent
to economic development; and that it is in the public interest and welfare to
provide for a program to eliminate the unsightly practice of abandoning
vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household
appliances. In view of these findings, the City declares it to be a public
policy of the City to eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned
vehicles, junked vehicles, old vehicle tires, and certain abandoned or
inoperative appliances and to eliminate the visual pollution resulting from
these items, and that in order to provide for the public health, safety and
welfare, and quality of life, to enact legislation to that and by providing
expeditious means and methods for effecting the disposal of abandoned vehicles,
junked vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned household appliances.
The City further finds and declares that the presence of an abandoned or
inoperative household appliance, or any part thereof, on private or public
property, including but not limited to highways, except as expressly
hereinafter permitted, is a public nuisance injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of this City which shall be abated
as such by the methods provided in this article.

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
 501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

following acts of the minor child:
   (a)   The malicious and willful injury to the person of another; or

another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.
   For purposes of this section, "custodial parent or parents" means the parent
or parents with whom the minor child is living, or a divorced or separated
parent who does not have legal custody but who is exercising supervisory
control over the minor child at the time of the minor child's act.

or heart disease, emphysema, and other serious health problems while the use of
smokeless tobacco may cause gum disease and oral cancer. It is the further
intent of the Legislature to reduce tobacco use by keeping tobacco products out
of the hands of youth and young adults by banning the sale of tobacco products
to persons younger than twenty-one years of age to ease the personal tragedy
and eradicate the severe economic loss associated with the use of tobacco and
to provide the state with a citizenry free from the use of tobacco.

reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed shoplifting, may
detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable
detention shall not constitute an arrest nor shall it render the owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, liable to the person detained.

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

“deadly weapon” does not include pepper spray as defined in subsection (l)
hereof when used by any person solely for self-defense purposes.

Virginia 60A-1-101(m).

limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and

recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

SCHEDULE II
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE IS
CONNECTED TO THE UTILITY’S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
   Where the Utility has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, down spouts,
storm sewer or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the Utility’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
Utility in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service
Commission to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the
customer calculated on the basis of the following formula:
S - A x R x .0006233 x C
   S -    The surcharge in dollars
   A -   The area under roof and/or area of any other water collection surface
connected to the sanitary system, in square feet.
   R -   The measured monthly rainfall, in inches.
.0006233 -   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of a
surface to thousands of gallons of water.
   C -   The Utility’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water
usage.
   The Utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery,
that it has been established by smoke testing, or on-site inspection that rain
or other surface water is being introduced into the sanitary sewer system at
the customer’s location, and that the customer has not acted within thirty (30)
days from the receipt of such notice to divert the water from the sanitary
sewer system.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to possible termination of service in accordance with
the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia.
SCHEDULE III
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN THE CASE OF
USERS PRODUCING UNUSUAL WASTE
   The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
   Ci =   Charge to unusual users per year.
   Vo =   Average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in
dollars per gallon.
   Vi =   Volume of waste from unusual users, in gallons per year.
   Bo =   Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) in dollars per year.
   Bi =    Weight of BOD from unusual users in pounds per year.
   So =    Average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment
chargeable to total solids), in dollars per pound.
   Si =    Weight of total solids from unusual users, in pounds per year.
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made at the owner’s
expense. Waste containing material which, in the judgment of the Utility,
should not be introduced into the sewer system, need not be handled by it. The
results of this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of
the proposed service and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out
above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage service will be monitored on a regular basis and
the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and
the audit of the Utility records, new cost figures will be calculated for use
in the above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall
be paid for by the unusual user. Based on these audited figures, additional
billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual
user, or refund given by the Utility, as the case may be. Such audited figures
will then be used for the preliminary billing for the next year, at the end of
which an adjustment will be made aforesaid.
   
SCHEDULE IV
APPLICABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS OF THE UTILITY
   Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Utility’s wastewater
collection and/or treatment system by certain industrial plant or plants cannot
be accurately determined by the use of the plant’s water meter or meters, and

936.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to control discharges into the public sewage
collection system and wastewater treatment plant that interfere with the
operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines, interfere
with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute waste of a
strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is beyond the
treatment capability of the wastewater treatment plant.
(Ord. 5-8-17.)
936.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Grease - Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease (FOG)
from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and grease shall be
deemed as Grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleum based
products.
   (b)   Grease Trap - A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases
and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to
collect settable solids, generated by and from food preparation activities,
prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection
and treatment system.
   (c)   Food Service Facilities - Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing,
rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting,
toasting, or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing,
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food
product in or on a receptacle that requires washing. These facilities include
restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing
plants, or any other sewer users who discharge applicable waste as determined
by the City's Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent (SWWTP).
   (d)   User - Any person or establishment including those located outside the
jurisdictional limits of the city who contributes, causes, or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater in the city's wastewater collection or
treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
   (e)   Oil/Water Separator- An approved, industry standard system that is
specifically designed, and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system
shall allow the oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to
prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only
oil/water separators manufactured for that specific operation will be approved.
Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required so as to
allow a proper review by the SWWTP.
(Ord. 5-8-17.)
936.03  CONTROL PLAN FOR (FOG) AND FOOD WASTE.
   (a)   Any new construction, renovation or expansion of Food Service
Facilities shall be required to submit to the city a FOG and food waste control
plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into
the wastewater collection system.
   (b)   Any existing Food Service Facilities shall also be required to submit
a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the discharge
of undesirable materials into the
wastewater collection system. Existing facilities shall not be exempt from the
requirement of this article. There will be no "Grandfathering".
(Ord. 5-8-17.)
936.04  GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (a)   Installation Requirements. All existing, proposed, or newly remodeled
Food Service Facilities that are tied onto our sanitary sewer lines service
area shall be required to install, at the user's expense, an approved, properly
operated and maintained grease trap.
   (b)   Sanitary Sewer Flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows
shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
   (c)   Floor Drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential
to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
   (d)   Garbage Grinders/Disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste
products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a
grinder/disposal is used, it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of
grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the
grease trap and will require an increase pumping frequency to ensure continuous
and effective operation.
   (e)   Dishwashers.  Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease
trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow
it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly
to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify
and float to the top of the trap.
   (f)   Location. Grease traps shall be installed outside the building
upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow
easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at
any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building
without written approval by the SWWTP.
   (g)   Pass Through Limits.  No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from grease trap to exceed 100 MgPL (milligrams per liter) as
identified by EPA method 413.
(Ord. 5-8-17.)
936.05 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Construction. Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with the
City of Summersville's standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments
with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal devises or
technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the SWWTP or Plant
Superintendent. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal
efficiencies of the proposed technology.
   (b)   Access.  Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to
allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to trap shall be provided by
two manholes (one on each compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast
iron frame and cover.

1121.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the City of
Summersville, West Virginia.
(Passed 3-25-14)
1121.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and /or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)   The City, by and through its departments (particularly the Building
Maintenance Board) shall inspect and monitor vacant buildings (especially
vacant downtown buildings), shall assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to
rehabilitate and develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (e)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing
procedure (that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders,
fines, liens, appeals and due lien enforcement) by placing the responsibility
to register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner before a
building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a complaint.
(Passed 3-25-14)
1121.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
   (1)   “Administrator” means the Summersville City Recorder.
   (2)   “Boarded” means a building or structure subject to the provision of
this article shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more
exterior doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a
sheet or sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door
or window.
   (3)   “Exterior maintenance and major systems" means the safe and lawful
maintenance of the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior
of the building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the
roof, the electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer
system, and the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable and
as enforced by the Building Maintenance Board, particularly in connection with
codes adopted by the City as well as all applicable local, state and federal
laws.
   (4)   “Occupied”. means any building or structure shall be deemed to be
occupied if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides
in or in any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the
legal or equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient
basis, or any combination of the same. For purposes of this article, evidence
offered to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be
limited to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S.
Postal Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and
sewer services; a valid City business license, or the most recent, federal,
state or City income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the
official business or residence address of the person or business claiming
occupancy; or proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
   (5)   “Open”. means a building or structure subject to the provisions of
this section shall be deemed to be "open" if any one or more doors other than a
storm door is broken, open and /or closed but, without a properly functioning
lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not capable of being
locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the same.
   (6)   “Owner”. An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser estate
therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents, receiver,
executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or corporation that
is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to the provisions of
this article, and as set forth below.
   (7)   “Vacant”. A building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conduct a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully reside, dwell, or live in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-
transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed vacant and subject to
the registration and possible penalty provisions provided herein if the
exterior maintenance and major building systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources, water service, etc). Continued is meant to be
without more than thirty (30) day interruption in any given (360) day period.
In order for such continual utility service to be considered as being actually
in use as described in this article, it must be more than merely registered to
the owner for purposes of billing and must be utilized, at a minimum, in order
to keep the property and the major systems of the building in compliance with
building and safety codes. The person or entity asserting that there has been
continued utility service has the burden to produce actual bills evidencing
utility service for the relevant period.

deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and arrangements made
for the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an
inspection, the City will seek an administrative search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal Court, to authorize
inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining the structural
integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its structural
integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police

present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains

1121.08 REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
    (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Summersville that contain a vacant structure, as defined above,
shall register the same with the Office of the Building Inspector of the City.
For those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption
of this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the Building Inspector within 30 days after the structure is found to meet
the definition of a vacant structure. The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the Administrator, Building
Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the City, so as to
ensure that the purpose of this article is met. Specifically, the above named
City officers shall have the authority to require that the property owner
provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time the building remains vacant.
The above named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to the owner
for corrective action deemed necessary. The Building Inspector and Fire Chief
shall rely upon the West Virginia State Building and Fire Codes, as well as
other applicable law, for guidance during any such structural review.
   (b)   If none of the persons listed, as above, is shown at an address within
the State, the registration statement also shall provide the name and address
of the person who resides within the state who is responsible, local party or
agent, both for purpose of service of any and all notices or registration
statements as herein authorized and in connection herewith. Registration shall
be required for all vacant buildings, whether vacant and secure, vacant and
open or vacant and boarded, and shall be required whenever any building has
remained vacant for sixty (60) consecutive days or more. In no instance shall
the registration of a vacant building and the payment of registration fees be
construed to exonerate the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance
with the Building Code or Fire Code requirement. One registration statement may
be filed to include all vacant buildings of the owner so registering, but each
structure constitutes a separate fee. The owner of the vacant property as of
the last day of the month when the property has been registered of each
calendar year shall be responsible for the payment of the non- refundable
registration fee. Said fee shall be billed by the City; and based on the
duration of the vacancy as determined by the following scale:
      (1)   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
      (2)   $200.00 for properties that are vacant for at least one year but
less than two years;
      (3)   $ 400.00 for properties that are vacant for at least two years but
less than three years;
      (4)   $600.00 for properties that are vacant for at least three years but
less than four years;
      (5)   $ 800.00 for properties that are vacant for at least four years but
less than five years; and
      (6)   $1,600 for properties that are vacant for at least five years, plus
an additional $ 300 for each year in excess of five years.
         (Passed 3-25-14)
1121.09 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   The owner shall have the right to appeal the imposition of the
registration fees to the City Administrator; upon filing an application in
writing to the Building Inspector no later than 15 calendar days after the date
of the billing statement. On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of
providing satisfactory objective proof of occupancy as defined in this article
specifically.
   (b)   A waiver of the registration fee, or an extension of a waiver fee up
to 90 days from the date of the current billing statement, may be granted by
the City Administrator or his designee upon application of the owner and upon
review and advice of the Building Maintenance Board; if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or
his designee that he/she is in the process of demolition, rehabilitation or
other substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the City Administrator or his designee
a reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or
other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or his
designee that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property
during the vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator, to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and documentable as necessary.
   (c)   Within thirty days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the
waiver application is received, the City Administrator or his designee shall
grant or deny the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch
the written decision by mail to the owner. If the owner properly submitted an
application for a waiver or request for extension to the City Administrator or
his designee, and the City Administrator or his designee rendered a decision
which the owner seeks to appeal to the City Council, the owner must file an
Appeal Petition in writing no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the
City Administrator or his designee's decision. City Council shall either grant
or deny the appeal. Thereafter the decision of the City Council is final unless
within thirty (30) days of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive
relief to the Circuit Court of Nicholas County.
(Passed 3-25-14)
1121.10 AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (a)   Duty to Amend Registration Statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same, to
contact the Building Inspector within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of
such change and advise the Building Inspector in writing of those changes.
   (b)   Exceptions.   This section shall not apply to any building owned by
the United States, the State of West Virginia, the City of Summersville, or any
of their respective agencies or political subdivisions.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register. The failure or
refusal for any reason, of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this article or to
pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section,
within 30 days after they become due, shall constitute a violation punishable
upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than $100.00 nor

constitute a debt due and owing to the City and the City may commence a civil
action to collect such unpaid debt.

manner as to the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if

and to take advantage of this period of consultation. Similar meetings should
be held by the subdivider with potentially interested partners or ultimate
users of the development such as lending and mortgage insurance institutions,
in order to reach a firm understanding of market demand, suitability of the
location, street and lot arrangement and other physical and economic features
of development.
   After review and discussion with the subdivider, the Commission shall
indicate the suitability of the plan for development into preliminary plans.

entrances giving access thereto, and shall be fully accessible for the storage
or parking of permitted vehicles.
      (3)    Public Garage: Is a building, not a private garage, used for
storage or repair of motor vehicles.
   (h)    Public Rights-of-way and Utilities.
      (1)    Alley: Any dedicated public way affording a secondary means of
access to abutting property, and not intended for general traffic circulation.
      (2)    Essential Services: Is the erection, construction, alteration or
maintenance by public utilities or municipal departments of underground,
surface, or overhead gas, electrical, steam, fuel or water transmission and
disposal systems, including towers, poles, wires, mains, drains, sewers, pipes,
conduits, cables, fire alarm and police call boxes, traffic signals, hydrants
and similar accessories in connection therewith, but not including buildings
which are necessary for the furnishing of adequate service by such utilities or
municipal departments for the general health, safety, or welfare.
      (3)    Public Utility: Is any person, firm, or corporation, municipal
department, board or commission duly authorized to furnish and furnishing under
State or municipal regulations to the public: gas, steam, electricity, sewage
disposal, communication, telegraph, transportation or water.
      (4)    Street: Is a public thoroughfare which affords the principal means
of access to abutting property.
   (i)    Miscellaneous Terms.
      (1)    Home Occupation: Is any use customarily conducted entirely within
a dwelling and carried on by the inhabitants thereof, which is clearly
incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling and does not change the
character thereof. A home occupation should not infringe upon the right of
neighboring residents to enjoy the peaceful occupancy of their homes for which
purpose the residential zone was created and primarily intended; and the home
occupation should occupy less than one quarter of the ground floor area of the
main building and is not conducted in an accessory building.
      (2)    Rooming House: Is a residential building other than a hotel in
which part or parts are kept, used, or held out to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for hire for three (3) or more persons.
      (3)    Zoning Exceptions and Variances:
         A.    Special Exception: An exception is a use permitted only after
review of an application by the Planning Commission, such review being
necessary because the provisions of this ordinance covering conditions,
precedent or subsequent, are not precise enough to all applications without
interpretation, and such review is required by the Ordinance.
         B.    Variance: Is a modification of the literal provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance granted when strict enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance would
cause undue hardship owing to circumstances unique to the individual property
on which variance is granted.
            The crucial points of variance are:
            1.    Undue hardship,
            2.    Unique circumstances, and
            3.    Applying to property.
A variance is not justified unless all three elements are present in the case.
         C.    The "Exception" differs from the "Variance" in several respects.
An exception does not require "undue hardship" in order to be allowable. The
exceptions that are found in this Ordinance appear as "special approval" or
review by Planning Commission. These land uses could not be conveniently
allocated to one zone or another, or the effects of such uses could not be
definitely foreseen as of a given time. The general characteristics of these
uses include one or more of the following:
            1.    They require large areas.
            2.    They are infrequent.
            3.    They sometimes create an unusual amount of traffic.
            4.    They are sometimes obnoxious or hazardous.
            5.    They are required for public safety and convenience.

building not used for commercial or industrial purposes where the cost of such
work does not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor shall any permit be
necessary for ordinary cultivation of land, or landscaping of any lot.
   (b)    Application for building permit shall be made to the City Recorder on

before the Mayor. Upon default in the payment of the penalty and costs, the

stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. If such certificate be
filed, proceedings or work on the premises shall not be stayed except by a

amended, or of this article, shall contain a reference to the provision relied
on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in light of the

      (4)    If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer and there has
been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall
make his report and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days and
the parties shall be entitled to make written recommendations thereon to the
Board prior to final decision or entry of findings. The Board's decision shall
be entered no later than thirty days after the decision of the hearing officer.
      (5)    Where the Board fails to render the decision within the period
required by this Section, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days
from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has
agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time.
   (e)    Notice of Decision.
      (1)    A copy of the final decision or a copy of the findings (when no
decision is called for) shall be delivered to the applicant personally or
mailed to him or her no later than one (1) working day following its date.
      (2)    The Board shall provide (by mail or otherwise) a brief notice of
the decision or findings and a statement of the place where the full decision
or findings may be examined to all other persons who have filed their names and
addresses with the Board.
      (3)    When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a timely decision, as
required by subsection (b)(3) or subsection (d)(1) hereof, the Board shall give
public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day it could have
met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in subsection (b)(1)
hereof. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do
so.
   (f)    Effect of Board's Decision.
      (1)    If a variance is granted or the issuance of a permit is approved,
or other action by the appellant is authorized, the necessary permit shall be
secured and the authorized action begun according to the stipulations set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance as found in Section
1329.04 .
      (2)    Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain necessary permits
within a six (6) month period from the date of approval, or having obtained the
permit should he fail to commence work thereunder within such six (6) month
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or applicant has
waived, withdrawn or abandoned his appeal or his application, and all
provisions, variances and permits granted to him or her shall be deemed
rescinded by the Board without further action.
      (3)    Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or
alteration within said six (6) month period, but should he or she fail to
complete such construction or alteration within said 12 month period, the Board
may, upon 10 days notice in writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance, or
the issuance of the permit, or the other action authorized to the appellant or
applicant; however, if the Board finds that a good cause appears for the
failure to complete said construction or alteration within such 12 month
period, the Board may grant an extension for such period of time as the Board
deems reasonably necessary.

   (a)    The boundaries of these districts are established as shown on the map
entitled "Official Zone Map of Summersville, West Virginia" which, together
with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this Ordinance.
   The "Official Zone Map" shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the City Recorder and bearing the seal of the City under the
following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zone Map
referred to in Article
1341 of the Zoning Ordinance of Summersville, West Virginia."
   If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance and Article 8A of
the Code of West Virginia, changes are made in district boundaries or other
matter portrayed on the Official Zone Map, such changes shall be entered on the
Official Zone Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City
Council with an entry on the Official Zone Map as follows: "on (date) by
official action of the City Council, the following (change) changes were made
in the Official Zone Map: (brief description of nature of change)", which entry
shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Recorder. No amendment to
this Ordinance which involves matter portrayed on the Official Zone Map shall
become effective until after such change and entry has been made on said map.
   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zone Map or matter
shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Ordinance.
   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zone Map

to the current zoning status of land areas, buildings, and other structures in
the City.
   (b)    In the event that the Official Zone Map becomes damaged, destroyed,
lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and
additions, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new Official Zone Map
which shall supersede the prior Official Zone Map. The new Official Zone Map
may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zone

1383.04 PROHIBITED AND ILLEGAL SIGNS.
   (a)    In addition to any sign or advertising device that is not

   (c)    Any sign, located in a zoning district other than the commercial

1383.03.
(Ord. 10-25-99.)
1383.06 MAINTENANCE.
   All signs and components thereof shall be maintained in good repair, free of
rust, peeling, flaking, fading, broken or cracked panels and broken or missing
letters. All signs, components, supports and their surroundings shall be
maintained in a safe, clean and attractive condition.
(Ord. 10-25-99.)
1383.07 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL SIGNS.
   (a)    Projections. No sign shall project beyond a property line or into a
public right of way, except as specifically permitted herein. (See Section
1383.02 (39).)

with the Building Code of the City, whether exempt or permitted by this
article.
   (c)    Obstruction to Exit Ways. No sign shall be erected, displayed or

   (e)    Illumination Devices. Devices that illuminate a sign or signs shall
be placed and shielded so that the direct light rays therefrom, or from the
sign itself, shall not be cast into the eyes of any passing motorist. (Ord. 10-
25-99.)
1383.08 GENERAL BUSINESS SIGNS.
   (a)    It shall be unlawful to erect, permit the erection of, display or
permit the display of any general business sign in any zoning district unless
such sign is expressly permitted by this section, subject to all of the
limitations and provisions stated herein.
   (b)    Signs permitted by Section
1383.03 are exempt signs and may not exceed the size, height or setback
requirement set forth herein. Neither shall they be added to the maximum total
display area of general business signs permitted on any lot, parcel or
premises. In the case where an exempt sign exceeds the display area specified
in Section
1383.03 for such sign, the sign shall be considered a general business sign and
shall be subject to every requirement of this article governing such signs.
   (c)    General business signs may be reader boards, canopy signs, ground
signs, projecting signs, off-premises signs, elevated signs, roof signs, wall
signs, portable signs, subject to the limitations set forth in this article.
Each general business sign may communicate an advertisement for more than one
product, service or subject. Off-premises signs and portable signs shall be
counted against the maximum total display area of general business signs
permitted on the lot, parcel or premises, on which it is located.
   (d)    In the commercial district, C-1, C-2, C-3, and industrial districts,
the maximum total display area of all general business signs on any single lot
or premises may not exceed five hundred (500) square feet, plus one additional
square foot of display area for each foot of setback beyond the setback
required by the district in which the development is located. In the shopping
center, the center is entitled to the full display area of signage and each
separate business in the shopping center is likewise entitled to the same
aggregate display area of signage. Furthermore, this allowance is applicable to
office and industrial buildings that house more than one business, service or
manufacturing operation. However, there shall be no more than one (1)
freestanding sign per road frontage for the entire shopping center or multi-
occupancy building. An out parcel at a shopping center may also have one
freestanding sign per street frontage.
   (e)    No freestanding sign permitted by this article shall exceed the
maximum height allowed for all principal structures in the district in which it
is located. Hence, when a building is erected to the maximum height allowed in
a district, a roof sign may thereby be prohibited.
   (f)   In no case shall any sign or signs, whether exempt or a general
business sign, be permitted in a zoning district that exceeds the size, height
and setback requirements established by this article. Furthermore, these limits
shall not be considered the subject for variance from the terms of this
article.

                  1383.03 is a general business sign and is therefore regulated
                  by Section
                  1383.08.
 
(Ord. 10-25-99.)

   (a)    All existing signs that are not specifically permitted or that do not
comply with all the provisions of this article shall be considered
nonconforming signs and may not, after the effective date of this section, be
enlarged, structurally altered or extended unless such signs shall be made to
comply with all the provisions of this article.
   (b)    Normal repairs and repainting of nonconforming signs is permitted.
However, when a nonconforming sign is structurally repaired, damaged or
destroyed by any means to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its
actual cash value at the time of loss, exclusive of foundations, it shall not
thereafter be restored, unless such sign shall be made to conform to all the
provisions of this article.
   (c)    All existing billboards located in any zoning district, shall be
considered non-conforming.
   (d)    All existing portable signs located in any zoning district, except in

shall be removed no later than ninety (90) days from the effective date of this
section.
(Ord. 10-25-99.)
1383.11 FEES.
   (a)    Signs permitted under Section
1383.03 do not require a sign permit and do not require the payment of a fee.
However, the sign and its supporting structure may require a building permit,
which requirement is not waived.
   (b)    Each application for a general business sign or signs shall be
accompanied by a check made payable to the City of Summersville, or cash in the
amount of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) for signs of less than thirty-two (32)
square feet in display area, and Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for signage greater

the cost of processing and shall be in addition to any building permit fee or
any other fee associated with the approval of a proposed or existing
development.
   (c)    Portable sign permit applications shall be accompanied by a fee in
the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each sign. The permit shall be
for a duration of not longer than one hundred eighty (180) days. Upon
expiration of said permit the sign must be removed from the lot, parcel or
premises, unless permit is renewed or re-issued for a like period and upon
payment of an additional fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
(Ord. 10-25-99.)
1383.12 APPROVAL OF PLANS AND ISSUANCE OF SIGN PERMIT.
   (a)    It shall be unlawful for any firm, corporation, company or individual
to construct or alter any sign without first securing a building permit as
outlined in this article. The City Recorder shall, therefore, require a plan of
the proposed sign that indicates the scale of the drawing or is property
dimensioned.
   (b)    In order to satisfy himself as to the conformity of the proposed sign
with this article, the City Recorder may also require the submission of a
survey of the lot or parcel upon which the sign is to be placed and which
indicates its proposed location on the lot; the general location of existing
and proposed buildings and other structures on the lot and the setbacks of said
structure; and the existing and intended use of any and all structures, whether
existing or proposed.
   (c)    If the proposed sign as set forth in the application, is in
conformity with all the provisions of this article, and other City ordinances,
the City Recorder shall issue a sign permit. If, on the other hand, the
application for a sign permit is not approved, he shall state in writing on the
application the cause for his disapproval, and return a copy of the same to the
applicant, regular mail. (Ord. 10-25-99.)

1385.01 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Summersville's
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities. The City of Summersville finds that Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities may pose significant concerns to the health,
safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its
inhabitants. The City also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the City
and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to insure
that the placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities is consistent with the City's land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this Local Ordinance is to
minimize impact of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities,
and protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Summersville.
(Ord. 12-12-05.)
1385.02 TITLE.

   (a)    If any word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other
portion of this Ordinance or any application thereof to any person or
circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid for any reason,
then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion,
or the proscribed Application thereof, shall be severable, and the remaining
provisions of this Ordinance, and all applications thereof, not having been
declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force and
effect.
   (b)    Any Special Use Permit issued under this Ordinance shall be
comprehensive and not severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be
invalid or unenforceable in any material respect, by a competent authority, or
is overturned by a competent authority, the permit shall be void in total, upon
determination by the City.

      (8)   Critical Facility: Any facility in which, even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include hospitals,
fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, and similar
facilities. These should be given special consideration when formulating
regulatory alternatives and floodplain management plans. A critical facility
should not be located in a special flood hazard area if at all possible. If a
critical facility must be located in a special flood hazard area it should be
provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and
provide services during a flood.
      (9)   Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or

hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the City of Summersville.
A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a Digital Flood
Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
      (12)   Flood Insurance Study: The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information,
and water surface elevations.
      (13)   Floodplain:
         A.   A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation;
         B.   An area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff
of surface waters from any source.
      (14)   Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land area that must be reserved to discharge the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
point.

additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood
damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
      (16)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for unknown factors that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights
of any given flood and floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at
stream crossings, and increased runoff from urbanization of the watershed.
Freeboard also tends to lower the cost of flood insurance.
      (17)   Highest Adjacent Grade (HAG):  The highest natural elevation of
the ground surface immediately adjacent to the development or structure
foundation. This is primarily used during insurance rating in approximated
floodplains.

surveying as defined in WV State Code.
      (22)   Lowest Adjacent Grade (LAG): The lowest natural elevation of the
ground surface immediately adjacent to the proposed development or structure
foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is
located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood
elevation.
      (23)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant
materials as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area

effective date of the City of Summersville's first Floodplain Ordinance adopted
by the City of Summersville and before the effective start date of this
Floodplain Management Ordinance is subject to the Ordinance in effect at the
time the Ordinance was issued, provided the start of construction was within
180 days of permit issuance.
      (26)   One-Hundred (100) Year Flood: A flood that has one chance in one-
hundred or a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

experience in the application of special knowledge of the mathematical,
physical and engineering sciences to such services or creative work as
consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning and design of engineering
works and systems; planning the use of land and water; teaching of advanced
engineering subjects, engineering surveys and studies; and the review of
construction for the purpose of assuring compliance with drawings and
specifications any of which embraces such services or work, either public or
private, in connection with any utilities, structures, buildings, machines,
equipment, processes, work systems, projects and industrial or consumer
products or equipment of a mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic or
thermal nature, insofar as they involve safeguarding life, health or property,
and including such other professional services as may be necessary to the

water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the
base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures.
      (34)   Special Flood Hazard Area: The land in the floodplain subject to a
one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, Al-30,
and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps
that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (35)   Start of Construction:  The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (36)   State Coordinating Office: The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (37)   Stream:  As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3u, any watercourse,
whether natural or manmade, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of
their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless
of its volume.
      (38)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (40)   Substantial Improvement:  
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition, improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank: The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation: The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this Ordinance. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(Passed 6-27-11.)
1717.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Summersville which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Summersville by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated July 4th, 2011, or the most recent
revision thereof including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Summersville by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Summersville where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Summersville's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Summersville shall notify the NFIP Administrator
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Summersville may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the City Recorder and any party aggrieved by
this decision may appeal to the board or commission designated by the City of
Summersville to hear such appeals. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail. Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the City Recorder.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this Ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either;
         A.   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or
         B.   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
City of Summersville in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall

1717.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the City of Summersville during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City Recorder.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Summersville, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe. Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Approximated Floodplain:
      (1)   The City Recorder shall use elevation and floodway information from
Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to determine the
elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the City
Recorder shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all proposed development
to determine the amount being invested and, the specific flood risk at the
site. The City Recorder shall then require the applicant to determine the
elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe from flooding
using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other techniques.
When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be
undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City Recorder.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
See appendix for Sample "Approximated floodplain (Zone A) techniques".
   (e)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.  
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Summersville, The City Recorder, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the City Recorder shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
See appendix for Sample "Stream Alteration process and contact sheet".
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Summersville in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The City Recorder may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered
Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City Recorder.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The City Recorder may require the use of certain "best
practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Summersville, a
legal agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be
performed on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and
other stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the
watercourse alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be
provided to the City Recorder. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the City Recorder shall subject the violator to the penalties
set forth in Section 
1717.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the City
Recorder, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.

   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article. Depending on
the type of structure involved, the following information shall also
be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.

City Recorder shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section 
1717.08(c).
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on
dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(1) above, stating that the finished structure, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage (Appurtenant Structures
only).
         A.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirms that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic f1ood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the City Recorder.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the City
Recorder shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section 
1717.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the City Recorder to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. The owner or developer shall
submit a preliminary site plan to the City Recorder that includes the following
information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
      (2)   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway when directed to do so by the City Recorder.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the approximated
floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map, development of
detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to
be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary area as
scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed
Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.

      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill. The City of Summersville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore:
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The City Recorder may require the developer to provide
compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1717.04(a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Summersville may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Summersville During permit review the City of
Summersville shall consider the following issues that have the potential to
cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use. Particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the City Recorder.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the City Recorder before a permit can be issued. After fill is
finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the City Recorder, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for
this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback. Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the
width of the watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top
of the opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from
the top of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation
shall be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along
the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall
be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (1)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (2)   The City Recorder may consider an appeal to the Flood Protection
Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is impossible to
allow any development without encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback
area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary and shall be made
only after due consideration is given to varying other siting standards, such
as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area. (Passed 6-27-11.)

All work on the proposed development shall be completed within 18 months of
permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a time extension
is granted in writing by the City Recorder. The request for a time extension
shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the extension. When
considering an extension, the City Recorder shall consider the following
criteria:
      (1)   Has the developer diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (h)   Inspections, Stop-Work Orders, Violation Notice and Revocations.

development covered by this or previous ordinance to determine whether any
portion of the development has been altered to be in non-compliance with the
requirements of this article.
      (2)   Stop-Work Orders. The City Recorder shall immediately issue, or
cause to be issued, a "Stop-Work Order" for any development found ongoing
without having obtained a floodplain determination or a permit. Disregard of a
stop work order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in
Section
1717.08(c).
      (3)   Violation Notice and Revocations. When it appears after
investigation that a permitted development is noncompliant with the provisions
of this law and/or the conditions of the permit, the City Recorder shall notify
the violator by means of written violation notice. The violation notice shall
specify the nature of the violation and request that the violation be corrected
within fifteen (15) days from the date appearing on the notice. Failure to
correct the violation within this time period shall be cause for revocation of
the permit and the governing body, or authorized employee or agent to:
         A.   Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of Nicholas County to
restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not limited
to requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the property
involved; and
         B.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in magistrate court or circuit
court.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local City Recorder stating that the building
or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying or using a
building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the violator to
the penalties described in Section
1717.08(c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local City Recorder stating that the particular development being inspected
conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and approval of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1717.08(c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local City Recorder stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1717.08(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local City
Recorder upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this article or local administrative procedures, and
any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing
certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a
condition of permit approval.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Summersville.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of Summersville based upon a set schedule approved by the
City of Summersville using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the City Recorder.
      (3)   Government Related agencies and nonprofit organizations shall
obtain a permit, but shall be exempt from the above fees.
      (4)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the

limited to professional engineering and surveying. The City Recorder may
require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional costs may include
reimbursement for contracted services.
      (5)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this article is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this article in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

1717.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the City
Recorder with respect to the provision of this Ordinance, it is the right of
that person to appeal to the City Council of the City of Summersville which
shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be filed with the City
Council of the City of Summersville, in writing, within thirty (30) days after
notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Board
shall set a time and place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Written notice of the time and place of
the hearing shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be
heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to
grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a
determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Summersville official that the issuance of a decision to
allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, such construction below the Base
Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications shall
be maintained with a record of all decisions; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and report such decisions issued in
its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties.  Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the City Recorder,
or any other authorized employee of the City of Summersville, shall be unlawful
and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall expeditiously
prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to
the City of Summersville of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution and/or imprisoned in
the regional jail for a period not to exceed 10 days. Each day during which any
violation of this article continues shall constitute a separate offense. In
addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved
including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The
imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with,
this article shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance with the
Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to
correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time.
Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in
noncompliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the City Council of the
City of Summersville to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
