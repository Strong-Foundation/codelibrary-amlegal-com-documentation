EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

the Town with which he stands charged, and except in cases of arrest on view,
shall be issued only on the complaint, on oath of some creditable persons. But
the Mayor may, by good cause appearing, by an endorsement on the summons, order

having jurisdiction, against the accused and his sureties if any, to recover
the penalty thereof.

the violation of an ordinance; and the expense of maintaining such person while
so in confinement shall be paid by the Town.

person shall enter into a recognizance with security deemed sufficient to
appear before the said court on the first day of the next term thereof, to
answer for the offense against the Town, with which he stands charged, and not
thence depart without leave of said court. The provisions of Chapter one
hundred and sixty-two of the Code of West Virginia, relating to recognizances
in criminal cases, shall be applicable to recognizances contemplated by this
section; but any money recovered thereon, or by virtue thereof shall inure to
the said Town.
SECTION 23. TRIAL IN COURT.
   If the appellant be found guilty of a violation of the ordinances in
question, whether upon the verdict of the jury or otherwise, the Court shall
ascertain by its judgment the fine or imprisonment to be paid or suffered by
such defendant, having regard to the punishment prescribed by such ordinance,
and shall include in any such judgment the cost incurred, by the said Town, as
well as in the proceedings before the Mayor as those in Court, including a fee
to the attorney for the Town of five dollars, and fees, if any of the Jailor or
keeper of the Town prison; and the proceedings to enforce the collection of any
such fine and costs may be as provided in section ten, eleven and twelve of
Chapter thirty-six of the Code of West Virginia, except the writ mentioned in

distrain therefor in case they are not paid within one month after they are
placed in his hands and notice thereof given for two weeks by publication in
one or more newspapers published in said Town; or by posting at one or more
public places in each ward; and as to such distraint and any sale thereunder,

Town taxes, whether real or personal estate, not collected before the first day
of January, after they are due and payable, he shall charge and collect and
account for interest at the rate of one per cent per month until they are fully

thereupon such offender may be tried and dealt with according to law, without
summons. The Sergeant shall execute, within the County of Hancock, any proper
process issued by the Mayor in proceedings for the enforcement of ordinances;
and shall collect, by levy of execution or otherwise, and duly account for all
fines assessed and the costs imposed in such proceedings. He shall also have
all of the rights and powers within said Town in regard to the arrest of
persons, the collection of claims and the execution and return of process, that
are or may be lawfully executed by a Constable of a district within the same,
and shall be entitled to the compensation therefor; and he and his sureties
shall be liable to all the fines, penalties and forfeitures that a Constable is
liable to for any dereliction of duty in office, to be recovered in the same
manner and in the same Court that such fine, penalties and forfeitures are
recovered against Constables.
SECTION 27. SETTLEMENT BY THE SERGEANT--COMPENSATION--PAYMENTS ON ORDERS.
   It shall be the duty of the Sergeant, at least once in six months during his
continuance in office, and oftener if required by the Council to render an
account of the taxes, fines, penalties, assessments and other claims in his
hands for collection, and return a list of such as he may not have been able to
collect by reason of insolvency, removal or other causes; to which list he
shall append an affidavit that he has used due diligence to collect the claims
therein mentioned, but has been unable to do so; and if the Council shall be
satisfied of the correctness of the said list it shall allow him a credit for
said claims; but may thereafter take such lawful measures to collect the same
as shall be by it prescribed. He shall receive for his services in the
collection of taxes, assessments and other claims due the Town, a compensation
to be fixed by the Council, not exceeding five per centum on the amount duly
collected and accounted for, except an additional per centum may be allowed in
case of fines, and may be allowed in addition, a salary of not more than three
hundred dollars per annum. He shall pay any more money in his hands belonging
to the Town upon the order of the Council.
SECTION 28. REMEDY AGAINST THE SERGEANT.
   If the Sergeant shall fail to collect, account for, and pay over all or any
of the monies with which he may be chargeable, belonging to the Town, according
to the condition of his bond and the orders of the Council it shall be lawful
for the Council to recover the same by action, or by motion, upon ten days
notice, in the corporate name of the Town, in the Circuit Court of Hancock
County, against him and his sureties or any or either of them or his or their
executors or administrators, if the sum does not exceed three hundred dollars,
such recovery may be had before the Mayor or any Justice of said County.

of assessments by County assessors; and to this end he shall have access to the
most recent books and record of the County of Hancock upon payment of
reasonable fees and charges to be arranged and provided for by the Council. The
latest accessible assessments, for State and County purposes, including value,
shall be used and adopted by him; but as to property not included in such
assessment, he shall ascertain the same, fix the value thereof, and include the
same in his assessment; but the Council may correct any error on his part in
this regard, upon the application of any person aggrieved. In the discharge of
his duty he shall have the same powers as are conferred by law upon County
Assessors.
SECTION 31. STREET COMMISSIONER.

shall order a levy of so much as will in its judgment, be necessary, and upon
all real and personal property therein, subject to State and County taxes;
provided, that such levies shall not exceed one dollar on each tangible, and
one dollar on every one hundred dollars of the ascertained value of such
property. At least once in each year the Council shall cause to be made up and

revenue received from the different sources, and of the expenditures upon the
different accounts for the preceding year, or portion of year as the case may
be.

   There shall be a lien upon real estate within said Town for the Town taxes
assessed thereon, and for all the fines thereof by the authorities of said Town
from the time the same are so assessed or imposed, which shall have priority
over all other liens, except the lien for taxes due the State, county and
district; which may be enforced by the Council in the same manner provided by
law for the enforcement of the lien for County taxes. If any real estate within
the said Town be returned delinquent for the nonpayment of the delinquent taxes
due thereon, a copy of such delinquent list may be certified by the Council to
the Auditor, and the same may be sold for the Town taxes, interest therein, in
the same manner, at the same time, by the same officer, as real estate is sold
for the non-payment of State taxes.

   Council shall have authority to require a Town license, as follows: for
anything to be done, carried on, exhibited within the Town for which a State
license is now, or may hereafter be required, for the keeping of hacks,
carriages, carts, wagons and other vehicles for hire within the Town, and for
the keeping of dogs within the Town; and the Council may provide for the
killing of all dogs, the keeping of which is now so licensed. Upon all such
licenses, the Council may impose a reasonable tax for the use of the Town, when
any license is granted by the Council for the sale of spiritous liquors, wine,
porter, ale or beer, and drinks of like nature, it shall take from the person
as licensed, a bond with approved security, in a penalty of not less than three
thousand and five hundred dollars, payable to the State of West Virginia, and

each. The one-fourth shall be paid within thirty days after the completion of
the work, and the remainder in three equal installments payable respectively at
such times as the Council may by ordinance fix, at the time of letting the

133.01 POLICE COMMITTEE.
   (a)   Purpose. To assist the Mayor and City Council in providing a safe and
efficient police force for the protection of all citizens and visitors.
   (b)   Authority. City Council hereby authorizes the formation of a Police
Committee to be comprised by two Councilmen, one from each ward, appointed by
the Mayor, one who will be appointed as Commissioner of Police or Chairman, and
the other a voting member who shall be the authority to fill in as Commissioner
of Police or Chairman in cases of emergency or absence.
   The said Committee will also be comprised of six citizens, three from each
ward who will be selected by the Commissioner of Police or Chairman and
recommended to City Council for approval.
   (c)   Finances. It shall be the responsibility of the Police Committee to
monitor its annual budget and encourage the Police Department to maintain
financial control. This may require the assistance of the City Clerk and the
Chairman of the Finance Committee.
   The Police Committee may at times find it necessary to make recommendations
to the Finance Committee or City Council for budget requests or adjustments for
various reasons.
   The Police Committee should also examine the income brought to the City
through fines and arrests each month for a more stable financial foundation.
   However, at no time should the Police Committee set financial goals or
encourage fines and arrests for the sole purpose of increased funds or budget
inducements.
   (d)   Hiring. When informed by City Council that a new police officer is
needed, it shall be the responsibility of the Police Committee to advertise for
the position or opening, and accept applications through the office of the City
Clerk. This would include any position other than patrolman that would affect
the police budget (ex. crossing guard, meter main, clerical, etc.). Advertising
for employment would be done through state and federal guidelines.
   Once applications have been received, it shall be the duty of the Police
Committee or a smaller internal committee to interview qualified applicants so
that a final selection for employment may be recommended to City Council for
their approval.
   (e)   Patrolman Citizen Complaints. In order to prevent Committee meetings
from being monopolized by complaints, whether by patrolmen or citizens, the
Police Committee shall have a three-person Board comprised by one Committee
person from each ward, appointed by the Chairman and also the Chairman who
would make the third member of said Board. The Committee ward representative
may be alternated by the Chairman at his/her will and pleasure. The Board would
meet when needed or called upon the Chairman and would review any and all
written complaints pertaining to the Police Department or its employees. A
written recommendation, if action is necessary, would then be forwarded to any
of the following for action:
      (1)   Mayor;
      (2)   City Council;
      (3)   Ethics Committee;
   (4)   City Solicitor or Judge; and/or
      (5)   Returned to the Police Committee.
   (f)   Committee Responsibilities. In order to provide a safe and efficient
Police Department for all citizens, and to assist City Council, the Police
Committee would also be responsible for the following:
      (1)   Uniforming and equipment of all employees;
      (2)   Maintenance and repair program and monitoring of all emergency
vehicles, cruisers, etc.;
      (3)   Monitor and schedule daily work routines for employees (ex.,
business checks, radar routine, patrol areas, etc.);
      (4)   Parking meters - violations and collections;
      (5)   Review City ordinances, request amendments or request new laws
where needed;
      (6)   Annual review of personnel files if needed;
      (7)   Review duties of crossing guards and meter maids;
      (8)   Communicate with City Solicitor and City Judge for problem areas or
recommendations;
      (9)   Review and regulate training programs;
      (10)   Make sure all newly hired officers meet State of West Virginia
certification laws;
      (11)   Make sure all certified officers meet State of West Virginia
certification laws;
      (12)   Discuss monthly reports and Department functions with the Chief of
Police;
      (13)   Maintain a set of written rules and regulations for all employees
in writing (vehicle rules, personal conduct, manner of dress, etc.);
      (14)   Consider pedestrian and homeowner security as well as motor
vehicle safety;
      (15)   Meet monthly on a regular basis or sooner when necessary; and
      (16)   Implement and coordinate public information/relation projects.
   (g)   Department Policy. It shall be the duty of the Police Committee to
draft and amend when necessary all policies regarding the Police Department.
All policies should be in writing and forwarded to City Council for their final
approval.
   It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police to see that all policies are
followed by his employees whether they be patrolmen, crossing guards, meter
maids, etc.
   The Chief of Police is not exempt from any policy and must set an example
for the Department to follow.
   (h)   Discipline. The Police Committee should put in writing all rules and
regulations that could pertain to disciplinary actions and the proper procedure
for the Chief of Police to use when he deems such improprieties would warrant
disciplinary action. This would include notification to the employee of his
rights of appeal, if any.
   (i)   Chain of Command. The New Cumberland City Charter states that the
Mayor as Chief Executive Officer of the City is in charge of all police,
including the Chief of Police, who at this time is appointed by the Mayor.
   The Chairman of the Police Committee, an elected Councilman, and also
appointed as Chairman or Commissioner of Police by the Mayor, shall serve as
second in command especially in the absence of the Mayor.
   The Chief of Police is in charge of and responsible for the actions of all
police officers and other police employees. His duties and responsibilities are
outlined in the City Charter.
   The Assistant Chief of Police will be fourth in command, but act only in the
absence of the Chief of Police.
   At the recommendation of the Police Committee, City Council may approve of
various ranks for patrolmen to complete this “chain of command”. When there is
no apparent rank between two or more patrolmen, the senior officer or the
patrolman with the most tenure shall assume temporary command until such
authority is contacted or arrives and assumes the responsibility of such
situations meriting “an officer in charge”.
   (j)   Executive Orders. The Mayor and Commissioner of Police, when possible,
should direct any orders, changes, requests, etc., through the Chief of Police.
At no time should the Mayor or Commissioner of Police direct orders to
patrolmen if they are unsure of consequences that could endanger lives or put
the City or citizens in any type of legal or financial restraints.
   Any Councilman may contact an on-duty patrolman and request special police
work due to citizen complaints, etc. However, only the Chief of Police,
Commissioner or the Mayor may give a direct order to Police Department
employees. All Councilmen have the right to a formal complaint and hearing on
any City employee.
   A patrolman who refuses to acknowledge with total disregard any complaint
within his professional ability may be subject to dismissal. All Councilmen
were elected by the people and are also trying to do their best to answer all
complaints.
   (k)   City Charter. All Committee members should familiarize themselves with
the City Charter located in the City Clerk’s office. This will outline for each
member the responsibilities of the Mayor, Councilmen and Chief of Police.
   (l)   City Solicitor. The City Solicitor shall be the final word in any and
all questions posed by the Committee. At no time will the Police Committee use
the advice of the City Judge, any county official, any other law enforcement
officer, magistrate, or any person offering legal advice without first taking
said information in writing through the office of the City Solicitor for a
final review and/or opinion.
   (m)   Restrictions. Members of the Police Committee will refrain from the
following:
      (1)   Giving orders to patrolmen;
      (2)   Questioning individual arrests during a public meeting;
      (3)   Discussing privileged information outside the Committee meetings or
City Hall;
      (4)   Infer to any individual, group or business that he/she is a
representative of the Police Department;
      (5)   Impede with the regular duty of a police officer using the Police
Committee as a grounds for discipline, debate, embarrassment or dismissal.
   (n)   Dismissal. The Police Committee may recommend to City Council the
permanent dismissal of any Police Department employee but must do so in
writing.
   Copies of the charges against that employee along with the Committee’s
recommendation should be presented to the Mayor, Chief of Police and City
Solicitor immediately.
   The Mayor has the authority to suspend any officer or employee immediately
and would be challenged to do so in certain instances.
   (o)   Reports to City Council. It is the responsibility of the Commissioner
of Police or Chairman to report at each and every City Council meeting the
progress and results of the monthly Police Committee meetings. (Ord. 90-001.

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section

though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.

warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense

section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may

alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.

afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,

361.07 DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES; JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLES; ABANDONED
OR INOPERATIVE HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES; CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    Statement of Policy. The City Council recognizes and declares that
abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles and certain abandoned or
inoperative household appliances are a public nuisance and a hazard to both
adults and children and therefore are dangerous and constitute a clear and
present danger; that said abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles and
certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve as harborage and
breeding places for rodents, insects and pests injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare; that the accumulation and storage of any of such
items or parts thereof on private or public property, including but not limited
to highways, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value
of private property and to promote blight and deterioration which if permitted
to remain will continue to destroy the natural beauty of this City and have
adverse economic and social effects; that said abandoned motor vehicles, junked
motor vehicles and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances
constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of
minors; that all such visual pollution is a deterrent to economic development;
and that it is in the public interest and welfare to provide for a program to
eliminate the unsightly practice of abandoning motor vehicles and certain
abandoned or inoperative household appliances. In view of these findings, the
City declares it to be the public policy of the City of New Cumberland to
eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned motor vehicles, junked
motor vehicles, and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances and
to eliminate the visual pollutions resulting from these items, and that in
order to provide for the public health, safety and welfare, and quality of
life, to enact a section to that end by providing expeditious means and methods
for effecting the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles

abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, or inoperative or abandoned
household appliances; provided, that before taking any abandoned motor vehicle,
junked motor vehicle or inoperative or abandoned household appliance into
custody and possession from private property, the enforcement agency shall give
the private property owner and the owner of said motor vehicle or household
appliance, notice as follows:
         A.    The City Police Chief or the City Building Inspector shall send
a certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery notice to the
private property owner with a description of the motor vehicle and the location
of the motor vehicle. Said notice shall advise the private property owner that
he or she is in violation of this section and that said violation must be
corrected immediately or the subject motor vehicle removed. Said private
property owner shall then have 30 days from the date of said notice to request
in writing a hearing before the Municipal Judge to show cause why the motor
vehicle should not be removed by the Police Department pursuant to this
section. If no such request is received within 30 days, the Municipal Judge
shall issue an order finding that the subject vehicle is an abandoned or junked
motor vehicle within the meaning of this section and authorizing the Police
Department to remove said vehicle from the property of the private property
owner.

remove said motor vehicle from the property of the private property owner, the
City Police Chief or the City Building Inspector shall mail a second notice by
certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery, to the private
property owner notifying him that said order has been issued and that, unless
the private property owner files a written request to appeal said order to
Circuit Court within ten days from the date of said notice, the Police
Department will execute said order and remove the motor vehicle from the
private property. If the private property owner should appeal, he or she shall
post a cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Failure to
post the required bond shall result in the dismissal of the appeal.

the subject property, the Police Department shall enter upon said private
property and shall execute the order authorizing removal of the abandoned or
junk motor vehicle by having the same towed by a wrecker service authorized to
do business in Hancock County, West Virginia by the West Virginia Public
Service Commission.
         D.    In the event that the private property owner refuses to accept
or fails to claim one or more of the certified mail notices required in this
section, no further notice shall be required to the said private property owner
prior to execution of an order authorizing the removal of an abandoned or junk
motor vehicle.
      (2)    Failure of the owner of said vehicle or the lien holder to reclaim
said motor vehicle shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and all lien holders
of record of all right, title and interest in the motor vehicle and of their
consent to the sale or disposal of the abandoned motor vehicle or junked motor
vehicle at a public auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.
   (g)    Abandoned or Junked Motor Vehicles; Charges and Fees.

charges resulting from taking and placing the motor vehicle into custody and
possession within the ten days.

Tires and Inoperative or Abandoned Household Appliances.

reclaimed as provided for herein, the enforcement agency in possession of the
abandoned motor vehicle or junked motor vehicle shall sell it either at a
public auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher. The purchaser of
such motor vehicle shall take title to such motor vehicle free and clear of all
liens and claims of ownership, and shall receive a sales receipt from the
enforcement agency which disposed of such motor vehicle.
      (2)    When an enforcement agency has in its custody and possession
inoperative or abandoned household appliances collected in accordance with this
section, it shall sell the property from time to time at public auction or to a
licensed salvage yard or demolisher.
   (i)    Proceeds from Sale of Abandoned Motor Vehicles: Junked Motor
Vehicles; Inoperative or Abandoned Household Appliances. From the proceeds of
any such sale, the enforcement agency which sold the abandoned motor vehicle,
junked motor vehicle, inoperative or abandoned household appliance shall
reimburse itself first: for any expenses it may have incurred in removing,
towing, preserving and storing said property and the expenses of conducting any
auction and; second: any notice and publication expenses incurred pursuant to
this article. If there be any remaining proceeds of any such sale, said
remaining proceeds shall be applied first to any fines and court costs which
are due and owing upon the conviction of any person of any misdemeanor pursuant
to this section incident to the keeping or abandoning of said property. Any
proceeds remaining after the payment of such fines and court costs shall be
remitted to the owner of said property. If the owner of the said property
cannot be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence, then the remaining
proceeds from the sale of said property shall be remitted to the general
treasury of the City.
   (j)    Injunctive Relief; Additional Remedy. In addition to all other
remedies provided for in this article, the City, through its attorney, may
apply to the circuit court, or the judge thereof in vacation, of the County
where the alleged violation occurred, for an injunction to restrain or prevent
or abate the maintenance and storage of abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor
vehicles, inoperative or abandoned household appliances, in violation of any
provision of this section.
   (k)    Construction; Severable Provisions. The provisions of this section
shall be liberally construed to accomplish objectives and purposes hereof. If
any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect or
invalidate other provisions or applications, and to this end all of the
provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable. (Ord. 10-004.

change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-

trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given

rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related
limitations.
      (2)   A Class 3 electric bicycle may not be operated on a bicycle path,
multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:
provided, that the provisions of this subdivision are not applicable to a

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

   No person shall cruelly ill treat, abuse or inflict unnecessary cruel
punishment upon, any infant or minor child, and no person, having the care,
custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.

or parents with whom the minor child is living, or a divorced or separated
parent who does not have legal custody but who is exercising supervisory
control over the minor child at the time of the minor child's act.

granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any rights of

but is not limited to:
         A.   The actual merchandise alleged to have been shoplifted; or
         B.   The unaltered content of the price tag or marking from such
merchandise; or
         C.   Properly identified photographs of such merchandise.

damages, including the value of the merchandise involved in the shoplifting;
and

the loss of time or loss of wages incurred by the mercantile establishment or

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not
limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.

imposed by this section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of
shoplifting, the court shall order the defendant to pay a penalty to the
mercantile establishment involved in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00), or
double the value of the merchandise involved, whichever is higher. The
mercantile establishment shall be entitled to collect such mandatory penalty as
in the case of a civil judgment. This penalty shall be in addition to the
mercantile establishment's rights to recover the stolen merchandise.

convictions for purposes of imposing punishment under this section, the court

   (b)   License Tax Imposed; Class A and Class B Retail Dealers; Grocery Store

by Article
521 of the General Offenses Code; or
      (2)   For any reason or grounds upon which a license might have been
refused in the first instance had the facts at the time of issuance of such
license been known to Council.
   In addition to the grounds for revocation or suspension of a license above
set forth, conviction of the licensee of any offense constituting a violation

contemplated action, and which shall be served upon the licensee as other
notices, or by registered mail to the address for which license was issued; at
which time and place so designated in the notice, the licensee shall have the
right to appear and produce evidence in his behalf, and to represented by
counsel.
   Council shall have authority to summon witnesses in the hearing before them.
   If, at the request of the licensee or on his motion, the hearing shall be
continued and shall not take place on the day fixed by Council in the notice
above provided for, then such licensee’s license shall be suspended until the
hearing and decision of Council, and in the event of revocation or suspension
of such license, upon hearing before Council, the licensee shall not be
permitted to sell beer pending an appeal as provided for by this section. It
shall be unlawful for any person to continue to sell beer after his license has
been suspended or revoked and, upon conviction thereof, he shall be punished as
provided in Article
521 of the General Offenses Code.
   The action of Council in revoking or suspending a license shall be subject
to review upon certiorari by the Circuit Court of Hancock County when such
licensee may be aggrieved by such revocation or suspension, in the manner as
provided in West Va. Code 11-16-15a in action by the State Nonintoxicating Beer
Commissioner to revoke or suspend a state license.
   All such hearings, upon notice to show cause why a license should be not
revoked or suspended, before Council, shall be held in the City Building unless
otherwise provided in such notice, or agreed upon between the licensee and
Council.

circumstance is held unconstitutional or invalid, such unconstitutionality or

within thirty days after due, then the amount thereof, together with a penalty
of ten percent (10%) and a reasonable attorney’s fee, may be recovered by the
Council in a civil action in the name of the City. In connection with such
action, such lien may be foreclosed against such lot, parcel of land or
building, in accordance with the laws relating thereto.
   (k)   Industrial Use of Sewers. Where the character of sewage from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes
a burden upon the sewer system in addition to the burden imposed by the average
sewage entering the sewer system, such additional charge shall be made therefor
as the Council shall deem to be fair and equitable to meet the additional cost
of collection, treatment and disposal of such sewage; and the Council may, if
it deems advisable to do so, compel the owner, tenant or occupant of such
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to treat such sewage in
such manner as shall be specified by the Council before discharging into the
sewer system.
   (l)   Duration of Liability for Sewer Service. Liability for service shall
begin for a user on the date of connection to the sewer system; and such
liability shall continue thereafter unless such premises are disconnected from
the sewer system with the approval of the Council. After such liability begins,
no allowance shall be made for vacant houses unless request in writing to have
the sewer system shut off is received by the Council, nor will any allowance be
made for any shut-off period which is less than thirty days.
   (m)   User's Responsibility to Keep Sewer Clean. The owner, tenant or
occupant of the property shall be continuously responsible for maintaining and
keeping the sewer pipe leading to and between the plumbing system of his
premises to the City’s connecting sewer clean and free from obstruction, and
shall not cause, suffer or permit any article or thing, liquid as well as
solid, to be introduced into the pipe which causes a stoppage thereof. In the
event of any such obstructions or stoppage, the Council shall have the right to
cut off the water connection, which shall not be reconnected until such sewer
pipe is cleaned and maintained properly; and in the further event of the
failure of such user to remedy such obstruction or stoppage, the Council shall
have the right to enter upon said premises and make necessary repairs, the
costs and expenses of which shall be included as part of the charges against
such premises.
   (n)   Leaks. No allowance or adjustment of any sewer bill shall be made for
water leaks of any nature occurring on the user's side of the meter if the
water so leaked enters the sewer.
   (o)   City Not Liable for Damage. Neither the City nor the Council shall be
liable for any damage resulting from bursting of any sewer main, service pipe
or valve, or from discontinuing the operation of its sewer valve, or from
discontinuing the operation of its sewer collection, treatment and disposal
facilities, for repairs, extensions or connections, or from the accidental
failure of the sewage collection, treatment and disposal facilities from any
cause whatsoever. In cases of emergency, the Council shall have the right to
restrict the use of its sewage collection, treatment and disposal facilities in
any reasonable manner for the protection of the City and its sewer system.
   (p)   Tampering with Sewer Appurtenances. No person shall turn, lift,
remove, raise or tamper with any cover or any manhole, basin, inlet or other
appurtenance of any public sanitary and/or storm sewer without a written permit
from the City, or of any combined sewer or sanitary sewer without a written
permit from the Council.
   (q)   Entering Sewer. No person, other than one employed by the City while
on duty, shall enter any public sanitary and/or storm sewer or appurtenance
thereof without a written permit from the City, or shall enter any public
combined sewer or sanitary sewer without a written permit from the Council.
   (r)   Injury to Sewer. No person shall break or damage any public sewer or
appurtenance or part thereof. (Ord. 89-001. Passed 1-9-89.)
   (s)   Plugging Required. Upon the discontinuance of the use of the City
sewage system at any premises, including discontinuance caused by abandonment
of any premises, tearing down any building, non-use or any other cause, the
property owner shall cause the connection to the sewer main of the City to be
plugged to resist breakage and be watertight enough to prevent any leakage of
any fluids. All such plugging shall be subject to inspection and approval by
the Inspector of the City Water/Sewage Board, provided that no permit fee,
inspection fee or other fee shall be charged for such inspection. If the owner
of the property fails to plug the sewer connection within thirty days of the
time the owner is notified in writing by the Inspector to plug the sewer
service line, the City shall proceed to plug the service line and bill the
owner for the costs. The cost may be collected by the City and a civil action
filed in court. The collection of the costs in a civil action shall not prevent
the filing of an action for a fine for violation of this subsection (s). (Ord.
285. Passed 6-3-85.)

evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the water
purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be
made. Ordinarily, ninety days will be allowed. However, this time period may be
shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the
device(s) in question.
      (3)   The water purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
      (4)   The water purveyor shall inform the owner by letter, of any failure
to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The purveyor will allow an
additional fifteen days for the correction. In the event the owner fails to
comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second re- inspection,
the water purveyor will inform the owner by letter, that the water service to
the owner’s premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five
days. In the event that the owner informs the water purveyor of extenuating
circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may
be granted by the water purveyor, but in no case will exceed an additional
thirty days.
      (5)   If the water purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial focus will be on high
hazard industries and commercial premises.
   (b)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on his premises.

   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the water purveyor to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the
case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any
existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle
device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event
that no backflow device is present. (Ord. 05-004.)
929.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner’s expense.
   (c)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the
repair, the device will be retested at the owner’s expense to insure correct
operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected
if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately.
   In other situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty days after
the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts,
repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is
an effective means of the owner insuring that there will be uninterrupted water
service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when
the owner desires such continuity.
   (d)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a) hereof in cases where there is a history of test
failure and the water purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved,
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by
the owner.
(Ord. 05-004.)
929.10 RECORDS.
   (a)   The water purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross connection tests and/or inspections.
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied by the WVBPH.
   (b)   Upon request, the water purveyor will submit records of inspections,
surveys, tests or corrective actions to the West Virginia Bureau for Public
Health.

SCHEDULE NO. 2
Surcharge Formula to be Applied in Cases Where Surface Drainage is
Connected to the City’s Sanitary Sewer System
   Wherever the City has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, downspouts,
storm sewer, or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the City’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action within thirty days of receipt of a demand by the City, in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission, to
eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   S = A x R x .0006233 x C
      S =   The surcharge in dollars.
      A =   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet.
      R =    The measured monthly rainfall, in inches.
   .0006233 =   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water.
      C =    The City’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water
usage.
   The City shall not impose the surcharge unless, and until, the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery,
that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site
inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from
the sanitary sewer system.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
SCHEDULE NO. 3
Surcharge Formula to be Applied in the Case of Users Producing
Unusual Waste
   The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
   Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
   Ci   =   Charge to unusual users per year.
   Vo   =   Average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume,
in dollars per gallon.
   Vi   =   Volume of wastewater from unusual users in gallons per year.
   Bo   =   Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) in dollars per pound.
   Bi   =   Weight of BOD from unusual users in pounds per year.
   So    =   Average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pounds.
   Si   =   Weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year.
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the City, should not be introduced into the
sewer system, need not be handled by it. The results of this preliminary study
will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service and the
charge therefor, based upon the formula set out above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage service will be monitored on a regular basis and
at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and
audit of the City records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the
above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be paid
by the unusual user. Based on these audited figures, additional billings
covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or
refund given by the City, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then be
used for the preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which
an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.
(Ord. 09-004. Passed 7-20-09.)
937.03 RATE ADJUSTMENT FOR FILLING AND/OR REFILLING SWIMMING POOLS.
   (a)   Adjustment. When filling a new pool (or recently purchased used pool),
the customer must notify the New Cumberland City Building at least twenty-four
hours in advance and request a meter reading before pool filling beings. City
employees will return for another meter reading after the pool is filled. The
customer is required to provide the water/sewer office with paperwork
information on the pool, including, but not limited to, size and estimated
gallons required to fill. Provided that the customer is not delinquent on
water/sewerage bills, and that the request is made during the billing cycle of
which the pool filling occurred, the customer will receive a one-time
adjustment of the City sewage rate on that gallonage only. The customer will
still be required to pay for all water used, along with sewage costs for
anything other than pool usage.
   The Chairman of the Water/Sewerage Board or his designee, for good cause
shown, may accept the gallonage of the pool filled and verification thereof and
may make the adjustment with a meter reading.
   (b)   Refilling or Adding Water to Existing Pool. When adding water to an
existing pool or refilling after repairs, the customer is responsible for both
water and sewerage rates. No adjustments will be made.
   (c)   Fire Department Usage. Should any Fire Department pump water from any
customer’s pool during an emergency situation, the City will replace that water
free of charge.
   (d)   Unauthorized Pool Fillings. No person shall use City fire hydrants,
holding tanks, or other unmetered lines for filling a swimming pool without
water being measured by the City, or without prior City approval. (Ord. 02-
003.)
937.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates the provisions of Section
937.03(d) shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more
than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per violation, plus costs. (Ord. 02-
003.)

subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed structures.
      (37)   Special Flood Hazard Area. The land in the floodplain subject to a
one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,

issued, including permits for substantial improvement or repair of substantial
damage, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Although a permit must be obtained prior to beginning land preparation,
permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (39)   State Coordinating Office. The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (40)   Stream. As defined in West Virginia Code §7-1-3U, any watercourse,

of its volume.
      (41)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (42)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-
related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions within a
ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood
event equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (43)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the Start of Construction of the improvement. This term includes
structures which have incurred "substantial damage", as defined herein,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure. Documentation that a specific requirement
of this Ordinance will cause removal of the structure from the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be
obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation
Officer. Any exemption from the requirements of this Ordinance will be the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
   For the purposes of this definition, improvement is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of
the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (44)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed, the top of bank will be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at least
fifty feet of relative flat land.
      (45)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this Ordinance. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or
other evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
         (Ord. 10-002. Passed 3-15-10.)
1721.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the City of
New Cumberland, which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as shown
on the Floodway map or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of New Cumberland by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the date of the most recent
revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also include those areas of
New Cumberland that have been identified as flood hazard areas by the City of
New Cumberland's use of historic or other technical data. These areas shall be
designated as appropriate with the level of technical data described below and
shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain area shall
consist of the following three specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the Floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (b)(4) below.
   In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated,
the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating
significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the City of New
Cumberland, be considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land
areas to a distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from
the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100 year
floodplain boundary.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe Area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the Floodway area. These areas are shown on the Floodway
map or FIRM.
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided, but no Floodway has
been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated Area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the Floodway map or FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified flood plain area may be revised
by the City of New Cumberland where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Potomac River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA).
      (2)   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the community shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of New Cumberland may identify and regulate new flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived
technical information such as flood of record, historic high water marks, and/
or topographic data.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1721.06 . Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to
apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood
Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Council of the City
of New Cumberland. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 10-002. Passed 3-15-10.)
1721.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood
Elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).
      (1)   A.   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4),
any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such
uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all
other applicable codes, ordinances, and regulations.
          B.   In the Approximated Floodplain (F4) the Floodplain Administrator
shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all proposed development not
covered by subsection (b)(1)B.2. below to determine the amount being invested
and the specific flood risk at the building site and assign a "minimal,
moderate or significant" risk level.
            1.   Development determined to represent a minimal risk and costing
less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) shall be required to provide "Point on
Boundary" elevation data and when available historic flood heights. The
Floodplain Administrator shall attempt to determine a height that will be
reasonably safe from flooding using this elevation data. If after review, the
data is found satisfactory, the Floodplain Administrator shall enter the flood
height in Section "G" of the Elevation Certificate. Any new or substantially
improved structures permitted using this method (other than appurtenant
structures) shall be required to have the lowest floor elevated at least three
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade even if the "point on boundary" or
historic flood data would indicate a lower flood elevation. If this method is
not adequate to allow the Floodplain Administrator to confidently determine the
flood height or if the applicant is not satisfied with the height determined by
the Floodplain Administrator the applicant shall be required to utilize one of
the alternate methods set forth herein.
            2.   Development determined to represent a low to moderate risk
and/or costing less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) shall either:
               a.   Provide the results of a Quick-2 engineering analysis; or
               b.   Attempt to obtain a Base Flood Elevation by submitting a
Letter of Map Amendment request to FEMA; or
               c.   Obtain flood height data by using the USGS methodology set
forth in the USGS Water Resources Investigation Report 87-4111.
The semidetailed method used will be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator
to determine a "Community Flood Elevation" in Section "G" of the Elevation
Certificate. If the applicant is not satisfied with the height determined using
these methods the applicant shall be required to utilize the method set forth
below.
            3.   Development determined to represent a high risk and/or costing
more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) shall develop a Base Flood Elevation
using a detailed engineering study method such as HEC-ras. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms and a completed
Elevation Certificate including Base Flood Elevation. In addition, studies,
analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. Base Flood
Elevations determined using this method can be used to rate flood insurance,
typically resulting in a reduced premium.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)   AE Area without Floodway (F3). Within any AE area without floodway, no
new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
one hundred (100) year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This
requirement can be satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where
determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all
proposed development to determine:
         A.   The amount being invested; and
         B.   The specific flood risk at the site.
   The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to determine
the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe from flooding
using the techniques set forth in the City of New Cumberland's Approximate A
zone administrative procedures. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are
required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer
who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such
uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the City of New Cumberland Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating
Office, and any adjacent communities and property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
Contact information for State and Federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate County, State, and Federal
governmental agencies are contained in the City of New Cumberland Stream
Alteration administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of New Cumberland, in
writing, that the carrying within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by professional engineers who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations. etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of certain "best
practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts, or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localize flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates, or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts, and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this
agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section 
1721.08 (c).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
         (Ord. 10-002. Passed 3-15-10.)
1721.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General. Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other flood hazard

shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) including
materials and labor, a brief written description of proposed work will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor of the freeboard height required by this Ordinance. Depending on
the type of structure involved, the following information shall also be
included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before vertical construction, it is highly
recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation data
completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made, this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the City determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
the base flood elevation that are 5 feet high or more). This agreement shall
state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access, or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only): All applicants are encouraged to
exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the level of flood
proofing above the height required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an
"elevation credited" flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood
proofing must extend at least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. above, stating the structure in question, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials - used
solely for parking of vehicles or storage (Appurtenant Structures only):
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground, and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation report or certificate, based on finished
construction, must be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of
demonstrated qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the
structure in question, together with attendant utilities, is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.    A minimum of two openings having a total net area not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               b.    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
               c.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion Agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion Agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section 
1721.08 (c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including Subdivisions, Commercial development and Manufactured
Home Parks, shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain
Administrator that includes the following information:    
       (1)   Name of engineer, surveyor, or other qualified person responsible
for providing the information required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to the flood plain areas, proposed lots and sites,
fills, flood or erosion protective facilities and areas subject to special deed
restriction. In addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and
other proposed new developments which are proposed to take place either fully
or partially within the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater than
ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base
flood elevation data and shall delineate a floodway. If FEMA has completed a
Flood Insurance Study (FIS), that data must be used to substantiate the base
flood. Otherwise, the developer may submit data provided by an authoritative
source, such as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, state and local water resource departments, or
technical data developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those
contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the flood plain areas, the preliminary plat (plan map) shall
include detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed
roads, public utilities and building sites. All such plats (maps) shall also
show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope
of the land and identify accurately the boundaries of the flood plain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision or other development lies partially in the
floodplain area and all proposed development, including fill, will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the floodplain boundary
depicted on the map, development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not
be necessary. In these cases, the site plan for the proposed development must
show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate
the area to be developed and the location of the floodplain areas as depicted
on the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor, or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Floodplain Areas. All lots on
the plat must have 3,000 square feet of buildable area outside of the
identified flood hazard area and be served by streets within the proposed
subdivision having surfaces not lower than one foot below the elevation of the
line defining the floodplain limits. All new structures must be sited on the
portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of the identified flood
hazard area.
(Ord. 10-002. Passed 3-15-10.)
1721.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Design and Construction Standards.
      (1)   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings, structures and
related utilities and facilities, the following restrictions apply to all
development, subdivision proposals, manufactured home parks, new construction
and to construction of substantial improvements to existing structures
occurring in the Flood Plain Area.
         A.    Basement and Lowest Floors.
            1.    Residential Structures. All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.    Non-residential Structures. All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork and utilities, elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation.
            3.    Openings. For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.    A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
               c.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
               d.    A Non-conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant on all flood-proofed structures and any elevated structures when the
community determines that the area below the first floor could be converted to
a nonconforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below base flood
elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall state:
                  i.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be
converted for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable
storage as detailed in this Ordinance.
                  ii.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of
the existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility
of the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
         B.    Manufactured Home Placement. Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of
substantial damage to property. Thus, new replacement, substantially improved,
or substantially renovated manufactured homes shall not be sited or relocated
within the identified flood hazard areas.
         C.    Appurtenant Structures.
            1.    Except as provided in subsection (a)(1)C.2. below,
appurtenant structures shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated
to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.    Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
               a.    Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size
and valued at less than ten thousand dollars ($10.000).
               b.    Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
               c.    Structures shall be located, oriented, and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
               d.    Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
               e.    Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               f.    Machinery, electric devices or appliances. and all
utilities shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               g.    The venting requirements contained in subsection (a)(1)A.
are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
            3.    A Non-conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature. A
copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
         D.    Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be
placed within any floodplain area shall:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
         E.    Fill. The City of New Cumberland officially recognizes the
beneficial functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of
water during floods. Placement of fill in the floodplain area can have
undesirable and detrimental effects on velocity, erosion, and sedimentation
rates causing increased flooding, and is therefore, discouraged and should be
minimized. No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
   Placement of fill in the floodplain is restricted to functional purposes
such as elevating a structure. Fill shall only be permitted in the same permit
with the related structure or other functional purpose. Placement of fill to
dispose of spoil from excavation or to elevate yards, parking lots, or fields
will not generally be considered a functional purpose. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the developer to provide compensatory storage before
permitting fill. No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1721.04 (a). All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
            1.    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of New Cumberland may require
the applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill
would not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
City. During permit review the community shall consider the following issues
that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
               a.    Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
               b.    Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
               c.    Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures.
               d.    Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
               e.    Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
            2.    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels, floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
            3.    The filled site must be contoured to drain properly and avoid
ponding.
            4.    Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient
distance to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall
extend laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points
before the start of sloping required in the following subsection. For
nonresidential structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable
for intended use. At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15)
feet beyond the building line, shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
            5.    Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted. No trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
            6.    Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use. Particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
            7.    Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two
(2) horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are
submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
            8.    Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
               a.    Fill slopes exposed to floodwaters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or
less must be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds,
or similar vegetative undergrowth.
               b.    Fill slopes exposed to floodwaters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet
per second must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock
slope protection.
            9.    All applicants placing fill in a mapped flood hazard area
must obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when
directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be
issued. After fill is finished the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a Letter
of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can
be issued.
            10.    The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         F.    Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures
and other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer
the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
            1.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow,
and
            2.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
         G.    Anchoring.
            1.    All structures and other development, including stream
crossings, shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering
practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing
the threat to life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage
of bridge openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
            2.    All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
         H.    Flood Protection Setback.
            1.    A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are not suitable, high priority shall
be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and
enhance aquatic resources.
            2.    Necessary public works and temporary construction may be
exempted from this subsection.
            3.    The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the
Flood Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front, and back lot line setbacks.
         I.   Storage.
            1.    No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in
times of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be
stored below Base Flood Elevation.
            2.    Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
            3.    Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and
making it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles
"fill" material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
         J.    Utility and Facility Requirements.
            1.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems.
            2.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether
public or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
            3.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities
and facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
            4.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
         K.    Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard.
         L.    Backflow Preventers. Backflow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.
            (Ord. 10-002. Passed 3-15-10.)

   (e)   Changes. After the issuance of a permit or site plan approval by the
Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
application, permit, or any of the plans, specifications or other documents
submitted with the application without the written consent or approval of the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (f)   Permit Placards.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit placard, which
shall be prominently displayed on the premises during the time construction is
in progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit, the date of its
issuance and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve or install a temporary electrical utility connection to any building or
premises or both or part thereof hereafter created, erected or rebuilt until a
placard has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator indicating that the
developer has applied for a permit and agreed to the requirements of this
Ordinance, or in the case of development occurring outside of the identified
flood hazard area, a Certificate of Compliance has been issued.
   (g)   Start of Construction. Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. All work on the proposed development must be completed within 18
months of permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire unless a time
extension is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The request
for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the
extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the developer diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare, or injurious to other property.
   (h)   Stop Work Orders, Inspections, and Revocations.
      (1)   Stop Work Orders.
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found on-going without having
obtained a permit. Disregard of a stop work order shall subject the violator to
the penalties described in Section
1721.08(c).
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found non-compliant with the

1721.08(c).
      (2)   Inspections and Revocations.
         A.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized official may inspect the premises to determine that the work
is progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable laws and ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances or
that there has been false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant, the
Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order Notice" revoke the
permit and request a temporary injunction.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official may
inspect any development covered by this or previous ordinance to determine
whether any portion of the development has been altered to be in non-compliance
with the requirements of this Ordinance.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof, hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard, it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof, hereafter created, erected, installed, or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of Compliance issued by
the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development being
inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof, hereafter created, erected, installed, or rebuilt until a Certificate
of Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this Ordinance or local administrative procedures,
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of permit approval.
   (d)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination Fee of twenty dollar ($20.00) payable to
the City of New Cumberland shall be assessed on all proposed development.
      (2)   Application for a permit for proposed development determined to be
occurring in a flood hazard area regulated by this Ordinance shall be
accompanied by an additional fee payable to the City of New Cumberland, based
upon a set schedule approved by the City of New Cumberland using the estimated
value of the proposed construction as determined by the Floodplain
Administrator:
 
Type of Development                     Fee
1 & 2 Family Dwelling                      $ per thousand
Accessory Structures                       $ per thousand
Any Other Structures                       $ per thousand
Site Plans, Grading & Filling (addn'l fee) $ per acre or part thereof
Floodway Development Reviews (addn'l fee)  $ per thousand
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of New Cumberland for any additional costs for services necessary for
review and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this Ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit, the fees specified above shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the City for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost,
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
offender. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this Ordinance in the execution of the
work from other penalties described herein.
      (5)   There is created in the City of New Cumberland a special revenue
fund administered by the City Clerk, designated the "Floodplain Development
Fund." This fund is not part of the general revenue of the City. All fees
collected pursuant to this Ordinance shall be deposited into the Floodplain
Development Fund. The Fund shall contain all fees or penalties collected
pursuant to this Ordinance, any appropriations to the Fund, and any gifts,
grants, or contributions received by the Fund.
      (6)   The City is restricted to, and shall distribute funds from, the
Floodplain Development Fund only for administrative costs associated with
management of floodplain development, the maintenance or creation of maps and
studies used to administer floodplain development and other activities which
will promote and enhance flood plain management issues generally. (Ord. 10-002.
Passed 3-15-10.)
1721.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provisions of this Ordinance, it
is the right of that person to appeal to the City Council which shall be known
as the Appeals Authority. Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within thirty
(30) days after the determination by the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt
of such appeal, the Appeals Authority shall set a time and place not less than
ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days for the purpose of hearing the appeal.
Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to all parties at
which time they may appear and be heard. The determination by the Appeals
Authority shall be final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
            3.   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that:
            1.   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a
structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance,
            2.   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases
risk to life and property.
Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as
required in subsection (b)(2)E. hereof.
         E.   The Appeals Board shall:
            1.   Maintain a record of all decisions including justification for
their issuance, and
            2.   Report such decisions issued in its biannual report to the
Federal Insurance Administration.
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the City, shall be in
violation of law and shall be referred to the City Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus court costs. In default of such payment
such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10 days. Each day
during which any violation of this Ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this Ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
noncompliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the violation or
noncompliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in noncompliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the City
of New Cumberland to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
