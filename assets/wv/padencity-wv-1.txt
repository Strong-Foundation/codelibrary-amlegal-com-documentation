EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Paden City Codified Ordinances is indicated.

or in any manner liable for payment thereof, except upon the direct action of
the Common Council as expressed by resolution of record before such sale. Said

the Recorder upon being requested so to do by the owner of said certificates to
certify said assessments to the clerk of the county court of the county in

obligation may be enforced in the name of the owner of said certificates in

thereunder, as to any specific real estate therein described or located,
showing that the same have all been paid, and such clerk is hereby empowered to
release the lien of such assessment as to any such real estate by noting a
release thereof on the record of the lien as to such real estate on the margin
of the deed of trust book where the same is recorded and such annotation by
such clerk shall have the effect to release such real estate from such lien as

of which such bonds or certificates of indebtedness were issued.

            , and County of                   , on the                  day of
           , do certify that, having been first duly sworn, we have fairly and
impartially held the said election according to law,
and the result thereof is as follows: For the office of                       ,
(here designate the office, as for example, 'Delegate for the County of
Barbour', or 'Senator. for the first senatorial district', 'Judge for the first
circuit,' 'Representative in the Congress of the United States for the first
congressional district', 'Governor of the State', 'Judge of the supreme court
of appeals', 'Justice
of the peace of said district', and so forth, as the case may be), 'A.B.
received                votes, C.D.                        votes, E.F.
                        votes', and so on throughout stating, according to the
truth, the full name of every person voted for, for every office, and in words

Given under our hands this                    day of
                         ." The certificates shall contain complete returns of
the polls taken at such place of voting for every office to be filled, and
shall be sealed and disposed of as provided by State law for certificates as to
the result of an election. When the certificates are signed, the ballots shall
be enclosed by the Commissioners in an envelope which they shall seal up, and
write their names in ink across the place or places where it is sealed, and
endorsed in ink on the outside of the envelope as follows: "Ballots of the
election held at precinct No.               , in the district
of               , and county of                        city of
                    , the day of  _______."

as such, shall keep in a well-bound book, marked "election record", a complete
record of all their proceedings in ascertaining and declaring the result of
every election in our respective City. They shall convene as such Canvassing
Board at the City building on the fifth day (Sundays excepted) after every
election held in this City, and the officers in whose custody the ballots, poll
books, registration records, tally sheets and certificates have been placed
shall lay the same before them for examination. They may, if deemed necessary,
require the attendance of any of the Commissioners, Poll Clerks or other
persons present at the election, to appear and testify respecting the same, and
make such other orders as shall seem proper, to procure correct returns and
ascertain the true result of the election in their City; but in such case all
the questions to the witnesses and all the answers thereto, and evidence, shall
be taken down in writing and filed and preserved. All orders made shall be
entered upon the record. They may adjourn from time to time, but no longer than
absolutely necessary, and, when a majority of the Commissioners are not
present, their meeting shall stand adjourned until the next day, and so from
day to day, until a quorum be present. The Board shall proceed to open each
sealed package of ballots so laid before them, and without unfolding them,
count the number in each package and enter the same upon their record. The
ballots shall then be again sealed up carefully in a new envelope, and each
member of the Board shall write his name across the place where such envelope
is sealed. After canvassing the returns of the election, the Board shall, upon
the demand of any candidate voted for at such election, open and examine any
one or more of the sealed packages of ballots, and recount the same; but in
such case they shall seal the same again, along with the envelope above named,
and the Clerk of the City and each member of the Board shall write his name
across the place or places where it is sealed, and endorse in ink, on the
outside: "Ballots of the election held at precinct No.         , in the
district of              , and County of                  , in the City of
                 , on the                   day of             ." Every
candidate who demands such recount shall be required to furnish bond in a
reasonable amount with good sufficient surety to guarantee payment of the costs
and the expenses of such recount in the event the result of the election be not
changed by such recount; but the amount of such bond shall in no case exceed
three hundred dollars ($300.00). When they have made their certificates and
declared the results as hereinafter provided, they shall deposit the sealed
packages of ballots, absentee voter ballots, registration records, poll books,
tally sheets, and precinct certificates with the Clerk of the City for whom
they were received, who shall carefully preserve the same for sixty days, and
if there be no contest pending as to any such election, and their further
preservation be not required by any order. of a court, such ballots, poll
books, tally sheets and certificates shall be destroyed by fire or otherwise,
without opening the sealed packages of ballots; and if there be such contest
pending, they shall be so destroyed as soon as the contest is ended; provided,
that the poll books shall be preserved until such time as the Clerk of the City
has completed the duties imposed upon him by this article. If the result of the
election be not changed by such recount, the costs and expenses thereof shall
be paid by the party at whose instance the same was made.
   (d)    Disposition of Certificates. The separate certificates of the Board
of Canvassers shall be given to the Clerk of the City who shall notify the
winner of the election.
   (e)    Tie Vote Procedure. Whenever Council, serving as the Board of
Canvassers, is to declare the result of an election, and it appears to them
that two or more persons voted for have received the highest and equal number
of votes for the same office, so that the election to the office is not decided
by the returns, they shall decide the tie by the election of one of such
persons.
   (f)    Contest of Elections. Notices, Time.
      (1)    In all cases of contested elections, Council shall be the judge of
the election, qualifications and returns of their own members, and of all City
officers.
      (2)    A person intending to contest the election of a City office or any
office that shall hereafter be created to be filled by the voters of the City,
shall, within ten days after the result of the election is declared, give the
contestee notice in writing of such intention, and a list of the votes he will
dispute, with the objections to each, and of the votes rejected for which he
will contend. If the contestant objects to the legality of the election, or the
qualification of the person returned as elected, the notice shall set forth the
facts which such objection is founded. The person whose election is so
contested shall, within ten days after receiving such notice, deliver to the
contestant a like list of the votes he will dispute, with the objections to
each, and of the rejected votes for which he will contend; and, if he has any
objection to the qualification of the contestant, he shall specify in writing
the facts on which the objection is founded. Each party shall append to his
notice an affidavit that he verily believes the matters and things set forth to
be true. If new facts be discovered by either party after he has given notice
as aforesaid, he may, within ten days after such discovery, give an additional
notice to his adversary, with the specifications and affidavit prescribed in
this section.
   (g)    Council to Hear Election Contests; Procedure; Review. Council shall
hear and decide election contests. Subpoenas for witnesses for either party
shall be issued by the Clerk of Council, and served as in other cases, and the
witnesses shall be entitled to the same allowances and privileges, and be
subject to the same penalties, as witnesses attending a circuit court in a
civil suit. The notice of contest shall be presented to Council at its first
term after the same is delivered to the person whose election is contested, and
the same shall be docketed for trial in such Council. At the trial of such
contest, Council shall hear all such legal and proper evidence that may be
brought before it by either party, and may, if deemed necessary, require the
production of the poll books, certificates and ballots deposited with its
Clerk, and examine the same. The hearing may be continued by Council from time
to time, if it be shown that justice and right require it, but not beyond three
months of the day of the election. At the final trial of such contest Council
shall declare the true result of such election, and cause the same to be
entered on the records of Council. When the result of the election is declared,
as aforesaid, a certified copy of the order declaring such result shall, if
required, be delivered by the Clerk to the person declared elected, if such be
the result of the trial, and such copy shall be received in all courts and
places as legal evidence of the rest of the election therein declared. Either
the contestant or contestee shall have the right of appeal to the circuit court
of the county from the final order or decision of Council in such proceeding,
upon .the filing of a bond with good personal security, by the party desiring
the appeal, to be approved by Council, in a sum deemed sufficient by such
Council with condition to the effect that the person proposing to appeal will
perform and satisfy any judgment which may be rendered against him by the
circuit court on such appeal. But such appeal shall not be granted unless the
party desiring the appeal shall make application for such appeal, and file such
bond, within thirty days from the entering of the final order in such
proceeding; and the circuit court may at any time require a new bond or
increase the penalty thereof when the court deems it necessary. When such
appeal is taken to the circuit court, as hereinbefore provided, it shall be
heard and determined upon the original papers, evidence, depositions and
records filed before and considered by Council and the circuit court shall
decide the contest upon the merits. From the decision of the circuit court, an
appeal shall lie to the supreme court of appeals, as in other cases, but such
appeal shall be heard upon the original papers and copies of all orders made,
without requiring the same to be printed.
   (h)    Costs in Election Contests. The cost of every contested election
shall include only the expenses of serving notices, taking depositions and the
allowances to witnesses; and shall be noted at the foot of every deposition or
set of depositions, by the person taking the same. If the contestant fails in
setting aside the election, there shall be awarded against him the amount of
such costs incurred or expended by the person who was returned or declared
elected. Otherwise, each party shall pay his own costs; unless it appears that
the person returned or declared elected was guilty of fraud or malpractice in
the election, or in procuring such return or declaration, in which case costs
shall be awarded against him in favor of the contestant. Where costs are
awarded in favor of either party, the amount thereof shall be ascertained under
direction of the house joint session, or court, which decided the case, and a
certificate thereof, authenticated by the signature of the presiding officer,
shall be delivered to the party in whose favor they are awarded, which
certificate shall have the force of a judgment, and if such costs be not paid
within ten days after the date thereof, the clerk of the city in which the
party against whom the costs were awarded resides, may issue execution on such
certificate, upon its delivery to such clerk, in like manner as upon a judgment
of the circuit court.
   (i)    Filling Vacancies. Whenever any vacancy shall occur in any elective
public office, Council shall fill such vacancy by appointment. Such appointment
shall be effective until the next general election.
(1978 Code Secs. 6-39 to 6-47.)

investigation or interrogation which results in a recommendation of punitive
action against him or her.
      (2)    "Hearing" means any meeting in the course of an investigatory
proceeding, other than an interrogation at which no testimony is taken under
oath, conducted by a hearing board for the purpose of taking or inducing
testimony or receiving evidence.
      (3)    "Hearing board" means a board appointed to hold a hearing on a
complaint against an accused officer. The hearing board shall consist of three
members to be appointed in accordance with the subparagraphs below. Hearing
board members may be removed from office as provided below.
         A.   The hearing board shall be a standing hearing board. The
department chief shall appoint the first member, the local fraternal order of
police shall appoint the second member, and the local chamber of commerce or
local businessmen's association shall appoint the third member. If there is no
local fraternal order of police, the state fraternal order of police shall
appoint the second member. If there is no local chamber of commerce or local
businessmen's association, the first and second members shall appoint the third
member by agreement. Of the three original appointments in each police
department, the first member shall serve for six years from the date of his or
her appointment; the second member shall serve four years from the date of his
or her appointment; and the third member shall serve for two years from the
date of his or her appointment. After the original appointments, all
appointments shall be made for periods of four years each by the designated
appointing authority. In the event that any member shall cease to be a member

appointed within thirty days of the date the ex-member ceased to be a member.
This appointment shall be made by the officer or body who in the first instance
appointed the member who is no longer a member. When the hearing board is
appointed, the three members shall elect one of their members to act as
president of the board, who shall serve as president for one year. In the event
that a member has had a part in the investigation or interrogation of an
accused officer or is related by consanguinity or affinity to an accused
officer, that member shall be recused from participation in the accused
officer's hearing. In such an instance, the officer or body who in the first
instance appointed the recused member shall appoint another person for the sole
purpose of the accused officer's hearing. No member shall hold any other office
(other than the office of notary public) under the United States, this state,
or any municipality, county or other political subdivision thereof; nor shall
any member serve on any political committee or take any active part in the
management of any political campaign.
         B.   Any member of a hearing board may be removed as provided in this
paragraph. The mayor of the municipality may, at any time, remove any hearing
board member for good cause, which shall be stated in writing and made a part
of the records of the hearing board. However, within ten days of removing any
member, the mayor shall file in the circuit clerk's office of the county in
which the municipality is located a petition setting forth in full the reason
for the removal and seeking the circuit court's confirmation of the mayor's
removal of the member. The mayor shall file a copy of the petition with the
removed member at the same time it is filed with the circuit clerk. The
petition shall have precedence on the circuit court's docket and shall be heard
as soon as practicable on the request of the removed member. All rights vested
in a circuit court by this subsection may be exercised by the judge thereof in
vacation. In the event that no term of the circuit court is being held at the
time the petition is filed, and the judge thereof cannot be reached in the
county in which the petition was filed, the petition shall be heard at the next
succeeding circuit court term, whether regular or special, and the removed
member shall remain removed until a hearing is held on the petition. The court
or the judge thereof in vacation shall hear and decide the issues presented by
the petition. The party affected adversely by the court's or judge's decision
shall have the right to petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of
the decision as in other civil cases. If the mayor fails to file the petition
with the circuit clerk's office within ten days as provided above, the removed
member shall immediately resume his or her position as a hearing board member.
         C.   Any resident of the municipality shall have the right at any time
to seek the removal of any hearing board member. To do so, the resident shall
file a petition in the circuit clerk's office of the county where the
municipality is located. The resident shall also serve a copy of the petition
on the member sought to be removed. The petition shall be matured for hearing
and heard by the circuit court or the judge thereof in vacation in the same
manner as civil proceedings in the circuit courts of this state are heard. Any
party adversely affected by the circuit court's or judge's decision shall have
the right to petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of the decision
as in other civil cases.
      (4)    "Police officer" or "officer" means any police officer of a police
department employed by the city, but shall not include the highest ranking
officer of the police department.
      (5)    "Punitive action" means any action which may lead to dismissal,
demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand or transfer for
purposes of punishment.
      (6)    "Under investigation" or "under interrogation" means any situation
in which any police officer becomes the focus of inquiry regarding any matter
which may result in punitive action.
   (b)    Investigation and interrogation of a police officer. When any police
officer is under investigation and subjected to interrogation by his commanding
officer, or any other member of the employing police department, which could
lead to punitive action, such interrogation shall be conducted under the
following conditions:
      (1)    The interrogation shall be conducted at a reasonable hour,
preferably at a time when the police officer is on duty, or during his or her
normal working hours, unless the seriousness of the investigation requires
otherwise. If such interrogation does occur during off-duty time of the police
officer being interrogated at any place other than his residence, such officer
shall be compensated for such off-duty time in accordance with regular
department procedure. If the interrogation of the police officer occurs during
his or her regular duty hours, such officer shall not be released from
employment for any work missed due to interrogation.
      (2)    Any police officer under investigation shall be informed of the
nature of the investigation prior to any interrogation. Such officer shall also

interrogation, the interrogating officers, and all other persons to be present

      (4)    The complete interrogation of any police officer shall be recorded

her not less than ten days prior to any hearing.
      (5)    Upon the filing of a formal written statement of charges or
whenever an interrogation focuses on matters which are likely to result in
punitive action against any police officer, then that officer shall have the
right to be represented by counsel who may be present at all times during such
interrogation.
   Nothing herein shall prohibit the immediate temporary suspension, pending an
investigation, from duty of any police officer who reports for duty under the
influence of alcohol or controlled substances which would prevent the officer
from performing his or her duties, or under the influence of an apparent mental
or emotional disorder.
   (c)    Hearing.  Before taking any punitive action against an accused
officer, the police or fire department shall give notice to the accused officer

affected by the order or by the department chief if he or she believes that the
department would be adversely affected by the hearing board's order. An appeal

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.

which a permit has been issued.

permit, shall be empowered to authorize the conduct of the parade on a date, at
a time, or over a route different from that applied for by the applicant. An
applicant desiring to accept an alternative permit shall, within two business
days after receipt of notice of the action of the Mayor, file a written notice

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

flagmen or operate authorized vehicles engaged in work at or near the site of
street or highway construction maintenance work, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice. (WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.
(WVaC 17C-3-9)

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this
section.

offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense

this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West

forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a

alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section 333.01 or
West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section shall be
without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section 333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the
dismissal and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law
to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to
whom a dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to
be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by
reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than
any inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as provided in
Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

      (1)   Temporary waiver.
         A.   The Council may waive any part of this noise section for a
temporary event if, in the sole judgement and discretion of the Council, the
noise the event will create or cause in excess of the noise level limits
established under this section is offset by the benefits of the event to the
participant or the public and the noise of the event will not cause undue
hardship or disturbance to the surrounding area. The Council may impose terms
and conditions appropriate to reduce the impact of the noise level exception of
the grant of a temporary waiver.
         B.   An application for a temporary waiver shall be filed with the
City Recorder. The applicant shall certify that notice of such temporary waiver
application has been provided to all properties contiguous to the property
where the event will occur, and to all properties opposite said property

for a temporary waiver shall not be approved less than ten (10) days after the
notice required under this subsection has been given.
      (2)   General waiver. 
         A.   The Council may waive any part of this section if the Council
determines that compliance in a particular case is not practical and would
impose undue hardship.
         B.   An application for a general waiver shall be filed with the City
Recorder. The City Recorder shall notify the Council of the receipt of an
application for a general waiver and the Council shall schedule a public
hearing on the application within sixty (60) days of such notification.
   (f)   Hearing. At least thirty (30) days before the public hearing, the
Council shall advertise the hearing as a Class II legal advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation. The applicant shall post a sign on the
property which is the location of the noise source and mail or deliver notice
of such general waiver application to all properties contiguous to the property
which is the location of the noise source, and to all properties opposite said
property measured at right angle to the intervening street or streets.
   Based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing and other reliable
information, the Council may grant a waiver upon such terms and conditions and
for such period of time as the Council deems appropriate to reduce the impact
of the noise level exception.
   (g)   Severability and Repeals.
      (1)   If any provision or portion of a provision of this section is held
to be unconstitutional, pre-empted by federal or state law, or otherwise
invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of
this section shall not be invalidated.

provision of this section are hereby repealed as to the extent of such

guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child

necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and

assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

radiological materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
the term “deadly weapon” does not include any item or material owned by the
school or county board, intended for curricular use, and used by the student at
the time of the alleged offense solely for curricular purposes. The term
“deadly weapon” does not include pepper spray as defined in subsection (l)
hereof when used by any person solely for self-defense purposes.

Virginia 60A-1-101(m).
   (g)   “Firearm” means any weapon which will expel a projectile by action of
an explosion: provided, that it does not mean an antique firearm as defined in

to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,

limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and
one-half inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any
other instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. A
pocket knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a
hunting or fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other
recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

901.01 DEFINITIONS.
   In this Article:
   (a)   “Owner” means:
      (1)   In the case of land, any person who is recorded on the tax records
as the owner of land, or
      (2)   In the case of property other than land, any person who is in
lawful possession thereof.
   (b)   “Occupant” means:
      (1)   A person who is in physical possession of a property, or
      (2)   A person who has responsibility for, and control over, the
conditions of a property, the activities conducted on that property, and the
persons allowed to enter that property.
   (c)   “Person” includes any individual, corporation, society, association,
partnership or firm, and the successor or the heir, executor, administrators,
or other legal representatives of a person.
   (d)   “Sidewalk” means that part of a highway especially adapted to the use
of or ordinarily used by pedestrians and includes that part of the highway
between the curb line (or the edge of the roadway where there is no curb line)
and the adjacent property line, whether or not paved or improved. (Passed 1-5-
04.)
901.015 DUTY TO REPAIR, MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT SIDEWALKS.
   It shall be the duty of the owner of any sidewalk to repair and maintain the
same in good condition. If a sidewalk is constructed, it is the duty of real
property owners to construct sidewalks on their property in accordance with
this article.
(Passed 1-5-04.)
901.02 SPECIFICATIONS.
   Any sidewalk constructed or repaired shall comply with the specifications of
the Code Official. All sidewalks shall be of uniform grade with streets or
alleys, and shall rise from the curb at an angle of one-fourth inch in every
foot in width thereof. All concrete walks shall have a minimum thickness of
three inches and of such width as may be specified by the Code Official, 3 feet
to 5 feet. If the property owner lives on a corner lot, the sidewalk at the

(Ord. 2008-8. Passed 8-15-08.)
901.03 MATERIAL.
   (a)   In the restoration of cement walks, in addition to the questions of
serviceability and durability of restoration, the matter of appearance will be
considered in determining the area to be restored regardless of the size of the
cut. In general, it will be the policy to require the restoration of a complete
section if more than half of the area of the original section is destroyed
incident to making the opening. The Code Official is authorized to require
restoration of full sections if, in his opinion, the circumstances justify such
action.
      (1)   In restoration of cuts in cement walks, they shall be neatly
squared out by a series of straight lines at least four inches back with the
old cement work in a neat and workmanlike manner. Finishing shall be done by a
broom finish.
      (2)   If the area of restoration of walk is materially less than total
frontage, an effort should be made to match as nearly as possible the
appearance of the balance of the walk in the frontage.
      
   (b)   Brick and stone walks shall be restored in a manner to produce a
pavement equal in every respect to the adjoining walk not disturbed. A
foundation of not less than four inches of cinders or gravel shall be provided
and thoroughly tamped. The bricks shall be laid on and the joints filled with
fine dry sand. All defective bricks shall be replaced by new or used whole
brick, of quality equal to those in the old walk. If more than half the
pavement area is disturbed, the Code Official may require restoration of the
entire pavement area as provided for cement walks.
(Passed 1-5-04.)
901.04 REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS.

of land, or other property that adjoins or is abutting to or on a sidewalk in
the City of Paden City shall be charged with the responsibility to keep such
sidewalk in a good state of repair and free from defects and debris. Whenever
in the opinion of Council the pavement of any sidewalk shall need any necessary
repairs, Council shall give at least fifteen days notice by certified mail to
the owner of the real property next adjacent thereto or to his agent to make
such repairs, and if the owner or his agent shall not make the required repairs
with the time limited in such notice, Council shall take proper legal action to
cause the property owner to make such repairs. Failure to maintain will result
in the City of Paden City undertaking such repair or remedy and charging back
to the property owner. On any claim presented for bodily injury or property
damage on the sidewalk, the adjoining or abutting property owner shall be held
liable in tort for such damages to another. Alternatively, should the City of
Paden City be called upon to make such payment to a third party, the City will
look to the adjoining/abutting landowner for contribution and indemnity.
(Passed 1-5-04.)
901.05 ASSESSMENT FOR REPAIRING.
   Whenever the owner of any sidewalk, or of the real property next adjacent
thereto, shall fail or refuse to pave the same in front of such property in the
manner and within the time required by Council, it shall be the duty of the
Mayor to cause the sidewalk to be paved upon the most reasonable terms and to
furnish and file with the Recorder a correct account containing a statement of
the expenses incurred. Thereupon, Council shall assess the amount of such
expense upon the owner or occupant of such property, and require the same to be
collected in the manner required by law for the collection of Town taxes, or
the same may be collected by a civil proceedings against the owner of such
property.
(Passed 1-3-84.)
901.06 CLEANING OF SIDEWALKS.
   Whenever in the opinion of Council, or of the Mayor, the pavement of any
sidewalk shall need cleaning, the Mayor shall give to the owner or occupant of
the real property next adjacent thereto at least twenty-four hours notice
requiring such sidewalk to be cleaned; and if the owner or occupant of such
property shall not clean such pavement within the time prescribed in the
notice, it shall be the duty of Council to take proper legal action to cause
the owner to clean such sidewalk; provided that, if the condition of such
sidewalk requiring cleaning shall constitute a hazard to the health or safety
of the public, the Mayor shall take such immediate action as needed to remove
the public hazard.
(Passed 1-3-84.)
901.07 CONSTRUCTION OF DRIVEWAYS.
   Any person desiring a driveway across the sidewalk into his premises shall
first obtain from the Street Committee the application for curb breakage and
driveway permit. The permit, if granted, shall specify the location of the

curb breakage request, to be no more than 14 feet for a single car and 20 feet
for a double car, the manner and materials for construction of such driveway,
whether slag, concrete, asphalt or other approved material, will be used to
designate the driveway, the time during which the sidewalk may be blocked for
the construction. Such person shall cause that portion of the driveway which
passes over or through the sidewalk to be paved with the same type of paving as
the remainder of the sidewalk and shall further, when required by Street
Committee, replace the curb stone that may be injured or destroyed by the use

any plans, specifications, other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the Board or its Chairman. An adequate and responsible bond shall
be required and delivered to the Board for the purpose of repairing and
replacing any damage done to any public street or way by reason of such
installation of a sewer connection or a sewer before such permit is issued. The
Board shall determine that amount of such bond.
   (c)   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation, connection and
maintenance of the customer services line shall be borne by the owner. The
owner shall indemnify the Board and the City from any loss or damage that may
directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the customer
service line, such installation shall be done by a certified plumber or a
person approved by the Chairman under whose supervision the installation shall
be made.
   (d)   A separate and independent customer service line shall be provided for
every building or series of buildings located on a single parcel of land owned
by the applicant. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new
customers’ service lines only when they are found, on examination by the
Chairman, to meet all requirements of this article.
   (e)   The slope, alignment and materials of construction of a customer
service line, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the Sanitary Sewer Specifications used by the Board. All
customer service lines must be a minimum of four inches diameter and must be of
either standard strength vitrified clay pipe provided with ASTM C-425 type
special joints, or medium weight ductile iron pipe with O-ring rubber joints,
or Cass 2400 asbestos-cement pipe, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe
meeting ASTM Spec. 2729. Adequate soil cover to protect the service line from
crushing or frost action is required. No customer service line shall be laid in
the same trench with any gas and/or water line and must be separated by at
least ten feet from any water line. The slope of the customer service line
shall be no less than one-eighth inch per foot. All excavations for customer
service line installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and

designated by the Chairman and shall be made by the Board employees under the
supervision of the Chairman. The invert of a customer service line at the point
of connection shall be at the same or higher elevation than the invert of the
sewer.
   (g)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains,
areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a customer
services line or lateral sewer which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a sanitary sewer. Upon determination that this type of connection
has been made, the Board shall cause the owner to be notified by certified mail
that he shall remove such connection within thirty days. Should the owner fail
to do so, penalties called for under this article shall be invoked.
   (h)   Except as otherwise provided in this article, each improved property
shall be connected separately and independently with a lateral through an
independent customer service line. Grouping of more than one improved property
on one customer service line shall not be permitted except under special
circumstances and for good sanitary reasons or other good causes shown and then
only after special permission of the Chairman as may be prescribed by the
Board; provided, however, a single customer service line may be permitted to
serve a school, mobile home park, apartment house or other permanent multiple
unit property.
   (i)   Where an improved property, at the time of connection to a public
sewer is required, shall be served by its own sewage disposal system or device,
the existing sewer line shall be broken on the structure side of such sewage
disposal system or device and attachment shall be made with proper fittings, to
continue such sewer line as a customer service line. The Chairman may, at his
discretion, permit the utilization of an existing sewer line provided an
inspection discloses that it is reasonably true to grade and alignment and in
good condition. In case of an existing sewer line utilizing a type of sewer
pipe not specified herein, the Chairman shall have the right to require the
owner to uncover the full extent of the pipe to determine its condition and may
require its replacement with approved pipe as outlined herein if the inspection
discloses such pipe to be deteriorated in any manner. The cost of replacing the
pipe, where necessary, shall be the sole responsibility of the owner thereof.
   (j)   No customer service line shall be covered until it has been inspected
and approved by the Chairman or his representative. Every customer service line
shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by the owner of
such improved property.
   (k)   The applicant for the sewer service permit shall notify the Chairman
when the customer service line is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made by the Chairman or his
representative.

user charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such
failure result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill
shall be payable.
   (d)   Users discharging any water or wastes with a thirty day average BOD in
excess of 240 milligrams per liter or a thirty day average suspended solids
content in excess of 240 milligrams per liter or containing suspended solids
with a character or quantity of pollutant requiring unusual attention or
expenses to handle or treat, shall pay, in addition to the base monthly sewer
user charges, an additional surcharge (Cs) as determined by the following
formula:

Owner must maintain for a minimum of three (3) years all records and reports of
all backflow incidents occurring in their facility/building(s). These records
and reports are to be made available to the Water Purveyor and/or WVBPH upon
request.
         (Ord. 2005-5. Passed 9-19-05.)
940.07 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross- connections and backflow conditions. All threats will be classified
by degree of hazard which will determine the requirements for the installation
of approved backflow preventer assemblies.
(Ord. 2005-5. Passed 9-19-05.)
940.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   Any existing backflow preventer assembly shall be allowed by the Water
Purveyor to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to
supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer assembly, or
there is an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard
has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow preventer assemblies must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure
principle assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow preventer
assembly is present.
(Ord. 2005-5. Passed 9-19-05.)
940.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the Owner’s expense.
   (c)   Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the Owner’s expense to insure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty (30) days after the test date may be established. The Owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts, or
a replacement assembly. Parallel installation of two (2) assemblies is an
effective means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the
Owner desires such continuity.
   (d)   Backflow preventer assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in (a) above in cases where there is a history of test failures and
the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional
testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by the Owner.
(Ord. 2005-5. Passed 9-19-05.)
940.10 RECORDS.
   (a)   The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain (update) the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer evaluations and/or inspections of cross-
connections and backflow conditions;
      (2)   Master files on all customer backflow preventer assemblies;
      (3)   Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs, and
replacements. Records for replaced backflow preventer shall be maintained for a
period of one year after date of removal from service;
      (4)   Records and reports of any backflow incident(s) occurring in the
public or consumer water systems shall be maintained for at least three (3)
years after the date of the incident; and
      (5)   Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH. This material shall be maintained for at least three (3)
years after submission.
   (b)   Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection and
non- compliance, surveys, test results and/or corrective actions, and backflow
incident reports to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated March 16, 1989, or the most recent
revision thereof.
   (b)   Description of Flood Plain Areas. The identified Flood Plain Area
shall consist of the following three specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified as such in the
FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The terms shall also include floodway areas
identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed in subsection
(3) below.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe Area shall be those areas for which specific
one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but which
