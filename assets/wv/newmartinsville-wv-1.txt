EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

relating to, and providing for, such improvements.
   (d)   Construction of sewers and sewer systems; assessments; corner lots,
etc.  The common council is authorized and empowered to order and cause to be
constructed, in the city, or part within and part outside of the limits of the
city, public, common, lateral, branch, trunk and combined sewers or public
sewer systems, or both, by contract or direct by the city, for the benefit of
the city or any part thereof, and to purchase lands or easements therein or to
condemn lands or easements therein in the manner provided by law for such
sewers or sewer systems.  When the common council shall order and complete the
construction of any such sewer or sewer system or any part thereof in the city,
the property abutting on such sewer or abutting upon an avenue, street, alley,
right-of-way or easement in which such sewer shall be constructed, or abutting
on  any avenue, street, alley, right-of-way or easement, in which any such
sewer or part of a sewer is constructed and laid, may be charged with all or
any part of the cost thereof, including the cost of such sewer or sewer system
at and across intersections at avenues, streets, roads and alleys adjacent
thereto.
   A sewer system shall be deemed to include all the common sewers whether they
be lateral, branch, trunk or combined sewers, which serve to drain a definite
drainage area as specified in the order of the common council directing the
work to be done.
   In case of a corner lot, frontage which may be assessed is to be measured
along the longest dimension thereof abutting on each street, alley, right-of-
way or easement in which such sewer is laid, but if sewered on both sides then
such corner lot is to be charged only with the side first sewered unless more
than two hundred feet in depth.  Any lot having a depth of two hundred feet or
more and fronting on two streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, one in
the front and one in the rear of said lot, shall be assessed on both of said
streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, if a sewer is constructed on both
such streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements.  Where a corner lot has been
assessed on either or both ends, it shall not be assessed on the side, and
where it has been assessed on the side, it shall not be assessed on the end.
   In case of corner lots where the cost of sewering along one dimension is not
assessed against the owner thereof, and in the case of lots less than two
hundred feet deep abutting at each end on a street, alley, right-of-way or
easement in which a sewer is laid, the cost of sewering along the dimension or
end not assessed against the property owner shall in every case be apportioned
and assessed against the other property abutting on the streets, alleys,
easements and public ways being improved, in the manner of apportionment of the
cost of improvements in intersections.
   (e)   What total cost to include.  In ascertaining the total cost of the
improvements in any project undertaken pursuant to this section, there shall be
included the cost and expense of surveys, engineering and attorneys’ fees, the
printing and publishing in relation thereto, and the cost and expense of all
labor, work, supervision, inspection, equipment leased, and materials furnished
and used in completing said improvements.
   (f)   Apportionment and assessment of cost.  The cost of the entire project,
including the cost of all improvements at and within intersections, shall be
apportioned to, and assessed against and borne by the properties abutting upon
the streets, public ways, alleys or easements upon which the improvements
involved in the project shall have been made.  Each lot or parcel of land so
abutting shall be assessed with that portion of the total cost of the entire
project which is represented by the proportion which the abutting frontage in
feet of such lot or parcel bears to the total abutting frontage in feet of all
the lots or parcels of land abutting on the streets, public ways, alleys or
easements so improved; provided, however, that if the character of the
improvements shall be substantially different upon different streets, public
ways, easements or alleys, or portions thereof, the cost may be equitably
apportioned to the respective streets, public ways, alleys, easements, or
portions thereof, in proportion to the character and cost of the improvements
respectively thereon; and as the part of the cost so apportioned to each
respective street, public way, easement, or alley, or portion thereof, shall be
apportioned to and assessed against the respective lots or parcels of land
abutting thereupon in the proportion as hereinabove provided; provided,
further, that if any part of the street, alley, easement or public way improved
is used by a railway then the cost of the portion of the improvements between
the rails and for two feet outside said rails shall be assessed against and
wholly borne by the owner of the railway; provided, further, that if there be
any land or other property abutting on the portion or the street or alley so
improved which it has been determined by the common council, and shown in the
ordinance or resolution authorizing the improvement, not to be specially
benefited by the improvement, or for other reasons would not be liable to
assessment for any of the cost of improvement, then the cost of the
improvements abutting such part of said street or alley, as is so determined to
be nonassessable shall be apportioned among, assessed and borne by the
remaining property abutting upon the portion of the street, alley, public way
or easement improved in proportion to the frontage of such remaining abutting
property as hereinabove provided; provided, further, that if there be any land
or other property abutting on the property of the street or alley so improved
which it has been determined by the common council, and shown in the ordinance
or resolution, not to be benefited to the extent of the cost of the
improvement, then the cost of the improvements abutting such part of said
street or alley shall be prorated.  The property so benefited shall be assessed
for only that part of the cost to the extent of which it has been benefited,
and the remainder of the cost shall be apportioned among, assessed and borne by
the remaining property abutting upon the portion of the street, alley, public
way or easement improved in proportion to the frontage of such remaining
abutting property as hereinabove provided; provided, further, that if such
improvement includes the construction or reconstruction of sidewalks on only
one side of a street, alley, public way or easement, then the cost of such
sidewalk shall be assessed only on the property abutting on that side where the
sidewalks are so constructed; provided, further, that in apportioning and
assessing the cost of sewers or sewer systems the provisions of subsection (d)
hereof shall be observed; provided, further, that if there be land or other
property abutting the street; alley, easement or public way so improved which
is owned by the United States of America, and, for that reason, not legally
subject to assessment, then the city shall pay the proportionate part of the
cost of the improvement which otherwise would be assessable against such
federally owned land or property.
   (g)   Ordinance or resolution authorizing improvement; approval of plans,
specifications and estimates; provisions for payment and cost and assessment
certificates; advertisement for bids.  After hearing held pursuant to notice as
provided in subsection (c) hereof the common council, by resolution or
ordinance, may authorize such improvement and the assessing of the total cost
or any part thereof on abutting property has herein provided.  In the same or
subsequent resolutions or ordinances, but before advertising for bids from
contractors, the common council shall cause to be prepared plans,
specifications and estimates of the cost of the proposed improvements under the
supervision of the engineer for the city.  Such plans, specifications and
estimates shall show the proposed grade and sufficient data for any owner of
abutting property to calculate approximately when proportionate part of the
estimated cost thereof might be assessed against his property, and shall be
filed with the recorder and open to the inspection of interested persons before
advertisement for bids of contractors and before the meeting at which such bids
may be accepted or rejected.  Before advertising for bids of contractors the
common council shall consider said plans, specifications and estimates and may
amend or modify them, and before advertising for bids shall by resolution or
ordinance approve such plans, specifications and estimates as so amended and
modified.  Such resolution or ordinance before advertisement for bids shall
also provide for advertisement for bids, for letting of contract or contracts
for the work to the lowest responsible bidder, with right reserved to the
common council to reject any and all bids and shall provide for supervision of
such work by the mayor, city engineer or other person or committee designated
by the common council.  Such resolution or ordinance shall also provide for
payment of the cost of the work when completed.  The common council shall
provide in such resolution or ordinance for the payment by abutting property
owners of the cost thereof in equal installments payable over a period of not
less than five years nor more than ten years from the date of assessment, with
interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the date of assessment, and
in said resolution or ordinance the common council shall fix the number of
installments in which the amounts assessed shall be payable; provided, that
each of said assessments or the installments  thereof then remaining unpaid
shall be payable at any time after assessment without interest after the date
of payment; provided, further, that on failure of the owner of the property
assessed to pay any installment as and when due, and such default continuing
for sixty days, then at the option of the holder of the certificates evidencing
such assessment, the entire balance due may be declared immediately due and
payable and the holder of the certificates may forthwith proceed to enforce the
collection thereof; provided, further, that if the amounts to be assessed
against abutting property be less than two dollars for each abutting front foot
of property, then the common council is authorized to make the same payable in
one lump sum or in installments, with interest, over a period of less than five
years from the date of assessment.
   (h)   Report on completion; notice to abutting owners of assessments;
hearings; correcting and laying assessments.  When the improvement of such
street, alley, easement, or public way has been completed, the common council
shall cause the engineer, or other person charged by the common council with
the supervision of the work of improvement, to make a report showing the
several frontages abutting thereon, and the total cost, and showing the
respective amounts chargeable upon each lot or parcel of land assessed abutting
thereon, and showing the proper amounts to be assessed against the respective
abutting lots or parcels of land as provided herein, with a description of the
abutting lots and lands as to ownership, frontage and location.  The common
council shall thereupon give notice to the owners of the property to be
assessed that on or after a date named in said notice an assessment may be laid
against the property so improved as embodied in said report.  Said notice shall
state that the owner or owners whose property is to be assessed, or other
interested party, may on said date appear before the common council to move the
revision or correction of such proposed assessment.  Such notice shall be by
publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county, and said notice shall show the total cost of the
improvement, the several frontages abutting thereon and the respective amounts
to be assessed against the abutting property, with a description of the
respective abutting lots and lands as to ownership, frontage and location.  On
or after the date so advertised, the common council may revise, amend, correct
and verify the report and proceed by resolution or ordinance to lay the
assessments as corrected and verified.
   (i)   Assessment certificates; issuance, sale and negotiation; recording
assessing resolution or ordinance.  Immediately on laying of the assessment
against the abutting property, certificates shall be issued evidencing said
assessment and each installment of principal and interest payable.  Said
certificates may be payable to the city or to the bearer and be signed by the
mayor and recorder or other equivalent officers of the city, and shall refer to
the ordinance or resolution laying the assessments; shall show the amount and
date of the assessment and describe the property against which the assessment
is laid, describe the same as to ownership, amount, frontage and briefly as to
location.  Said certificates shall also show the dates on which principal and
interest payments are due, and shall contain a provision that in event of
default in the payment of any one of such installments, and such default
continuing for a period of sixty day, then all unpaid installments shall become
due and payable at the election of the certificate holder and the holder may
proceed to collect all of the unpaid balances of installments, with interest
until paid.  Said certificates may be issued to the contractor making the
improvements in payment therefor, upon the contractor’s reimbursing the city
for those items of the cost and expense advanced by the city and mentioned in
subsection (e) hereof.  Said certificates payable to the bearer shall be
assignable by delivery of the certificates and be enforceable by the holder. 
The city shall not be held as guarantor or in any way liable for the payment of
bearer certificates.  A notice of the lien of said assessment, referring to the
assessing ordinance or resolution, and setting forth a list of the property
assessed, described respectively as to amounts of assessment, frontage,
location and ownership of the property, shall be certified by the recorder of
the city to the clerk of the county court.  The county clerk shall record the
same in a proper trust deed book and index the same in the name of each owner
of abutting property assessed.
   (j)   Liens; suit for enforcement; priority; when service may be had by
publication.  The property abutting the portion of the street, alley, easement
or public way improved shall be subject to a lien, from the date of the
ordinance or resolution laying the assessment, for the payment of the costs of
the improvements assessed against said property.  From the date of the
assessment the holder of the assessment certificates shall be the holder of
said liens and entitled to enforce the same in his own name or the name of the
city to the extent of the amount, principal and interest, provided in said
certificates, and against the said property, as to any assessment not paid as
and when due.  Said assessment shall be and constitute liens in the hands of
the holders of said certificates upon the respective lots and lands assessed
and shall have priority over all other liens except those for land taxes due
the state, county, and city, and except the liens for pre-existing special
assessments.  Said assessments and interest thereon shall be paid by the owner
of the property assessed as and when the installments are due.  The holder of
any certificate may enforce the lien thereof in any proper suit, and when
default in the payment, as and when due, of any certificate of principal or
interest or installment certificate shall occur and such default may have
continue for more than sixty days, the holder may at his option declare the
whole unpaid balance due and payable and by proper suit in equity enforce the
lien thereof, upon process issued and served according to law upon the owner or
owners of the land subject to said lien at the time such suit may be brought as
shown by the records of the clerk of the county court in which said land is
located.  Service by publication upon such owner may be had if, upon affidavit
filed with the clerk of the court where each suit is brought, it appears that
the owner of such land is a nonresident of the State of West Virginia.  Service
by publication may also be had upon such owner upon affidavit filed in said
clerk's office that personal process issued to the sheriff of the county in
which said land is located has been returned "not found" in said county and if
said affidavit also states that the plaintiff in the suit does not know where
the owner is resident.
   (k)   Assessment against property of public, charitable, eleemosynary,
educational or religious institutions; duty of those in charge to cause
assessments to be paid.  When any of the lots or land abutting  the portion of
the streets, alley, easement or public way improved consist of property owned
or controlled by the state, county, city, board of education or other public
body, or consist of property owned by, or used for, a church, or religious,
charitable, educational or eleemosynary institution for purposes not subject to
taxation, such property shall nevertheless be assessed with its proper
proportion of the cost of said improvement, and it shall be the duty of those
persons having charge of the fiscal affairs of such owner or the management of
any such property or institution to make proper arrangements for the payment
of, and cause to be paid, such assessments as and when due and payable.
   (l)   Payment of assessments or installment certificates; release.  Payments
of any assessments or installment certificates may be made to the treasurer of
the city or the holder of the assessment certificates.  If payment is made to
the treasurer, he shall require all interest to be paid which is owed up to the
time of payment, and notify the holder of the certificate, if informed of the
holder’s address, that he has received such payments, and make payment to the
holder on presentation for cancellation of the certificate representing such
payment.  If payment is made to the holder of the certificate, the holder shall
deliver to the payor certificates marked “paid” representing the payments made
of principal and interest.  On presentation to the treasurer for cancellation
of all certificates of principal and interest for the whole assessment made
against a specific piece of property assessed, the treasurer shall on request
execute and deliver a release of the lien of such assessment.
   (m)   Reassessment for void, irregular or omitted assessments.  In the case
of the construction of any permanent improvements where an assessment has
heretofore been laid or may hereafter be laid for the cost thereof, which said
assessment is or shall be void or voidable by reason of errors, irregularities
or defects in the proceedings under which such improvement was made, or in case
such assessment shall have been made against the wrong person or property, or
shall have been omitted to be made in a case where the same was proper, it
shall be the duty of the common council within ten years after the completion
of such improvements, or after any court shall have declared such assessment
invalid, to cause notice to be given to any person against whom the cost of
said improvement might properly be or have been assessed, of its intention to
lay such assessment and fixing a time and place at which the owner may appear
and show cause against the same.  Said notice shall be served in the manner
provided in this article in the giving of notices in assessment proceedings, or
any other manner provided by law.  At the time and place, under the notice
aforesaid, or at any time thereafter, the common council shall proceed to lay
and levy an assessment for the cost of such improvement as would have been
lawful under proper proceedings at the time said improvement was completed,
unless the owner so notified shall show good cause against the same.  The
reassessment so laid shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor in the
manner hereinabove provided from the date of the completion of the improvement,
with interest therefrom, and proper assessment certificates may be issued,
recordation had, and payment and the lien may be enforced in the same manner
and upon the same terms as would have been proper at the time of the completion
of the said improvement had the assessment therefor been then properly laid and
levied.
   (n)   Liberal construction of section; validity and enforcement of
assessments.  This section shall be liberally construed to accomplish the
purpose of providing reasonable, economical and expeditious means for the city
to provide permanent improvements and assure to the contractors making such
improvements, or persons directly or indirectly financing the same, security in
the payment of the cost and expense of such improvements; and nothing in this
section shall be construed as imposing a time limit on the certificate holder
for the enforcement of his rights.
   Moreover, the validity and enforcement of the assessment in this section
provided shall not be impaired by the issuance and sale of bonds, as provided
by chapter 13, article 1 (section 1053 et seq.) of the Code of West Virginia of
1931, as amended, for the same improvements, nor by the application, in whole
or in part, of the proceeds of any such bond issued to the cost of any such
improvements prior to collection of said assessments.
   (o)   Separability.  If any provision or part of this section is declared
unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall in no way affect any other
part hereof.
SECTION 31.  Collection of taxes, fines and assessments..
   Unless otherwise provided, it shall be the duty of the treasurer of the
city, or other individual who may be designated by general law, by this Charter
or by the common council, to collect and promptly pay into the city treasury
all taxes, fines, special assessments and other money due the city.  All such
taxes, fines, special assessments (except assessments for permanent or semi-
permanent public improvements) and other money due the city are hereby declared
to be debts owing to the city, for which the debtor shall be personally liable,
and the treasurer, or other individual so designated, may enforce this
liability by appropriate civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction,
and is hereby vested with the same rights to distrain for the same as is vested
in the sheriff for the collection of taxes.  Such treasurer or other individual
shall give bond, conditioned according to law, in such penalty and with such
security as the common council may require.
SECTION 32.  Remedies for failure to collect, account for or pay over money. 
   If the treasurer, or other individual designated, shall fail to collect,
account for or pay over all or any of the money with which he may be
chargeable, belonging to the city, according to the conditions of his bond and
the orders of the common council, it shall be lawful for the common council to
recover the same, in the name of the city, by civil action in the circuit court
of Wetzel County or, where the sum does not exceed three hundred dollars, by
suit before a justice of the district in which the city or the major portion of
the territory thereof is located, against the treasurer, or other designated
individual, or his sureties, or any or either of them, or his or their
executors or administrators.
SECTION 33.  Assessment, levy and collection of taxes to be governed by state
law. 
   The assessment, levy and collection of all city taxes shall be governed by
the provisions of chapters 11 (section 11-1-1 et seq.) and 11A (section 11A-1-
1 et seq.) of the Code of West Virginia.
SECTION 34.  Licenses generally.
   The common council shall prescribe by ordinance the manner and form in which
licenses of all kinds shall be applied for and granted, and shall require the
payment of the tax thereon before delivery to the person applying therefor.
SECTION 35.  Licenses to be issued pursuant to state law; terms and expiration
of licenses generally. 
   All city licenses shall be issued pursuant to and shall be subject to all
applicable provisions of the Code of West Virginia relating thereto.  Licenses
shall be issued for such terms and shall expire on such dates as may be
determined by the common council pursuant to applicable state law.
SECTION 36.  Eminent domain; fire companies; relief of taxpayers.
   The common council shall have the right to institute proceedings in the name
of the city for the condemnation of real estate for streets, alleys, drains,
markets, market ground, city prison or other work or purposes of public
utility; such provision shall conform to chapter forty-two of the Code of West
Virginia.  And said common council shall also have power to acquire by
purchase, gift or condemnation one or more lots necessary for municipal
buildings on which to place such buildings as they may deem necessary for the
meeting of said common council and for the keeping of the offices of said
common council, and for the keeping of the property of said city; and said
common council shall also have the power to organize or authorize the
organization of fire companies, hose companies or any other company or
aggregation of persons for the purpose of protecting the property of the
citizens of said city against destruction by fire, and authorize such companies
to create and hold property necessary and ordinarily held and used by such fire
companies.  The common council shall not have power to release or relieve any
taxpayer from payment of taxes levied on or assessed against him or them.
SECTION 37.  Powers and duties of chief of police.
   It shall be the duty of the chief of police to preserve order in the city,
under the supervision of the common council.
   The said chief of police shall have all powers, rights and privileges within
the corporate limits of said city, and within one mile outside of the corporate
limits thereof, in regard to the arrest of persons, the execution and return of
process, that can be legally exercised by a constable of the district within
the same, and he and his sureties shall be liable for all fines, penalties and
forfeitures that a constable of a district is legally liable, for any failure
or dereliction in his said office, to be recovered in the same manner and in
the same courts that the same fines, penalties and forfeitures are now
recoverable against such district constable.
SECTION 38.  Powers of street commissioner.
   The street commissioner, under direction of the common council, shall have
charge of the opening, maintenance, construction and repair of the streets,
alleys, ways, storm sewers and marinas of the city.
SECTION 39.  Inconsistent acts repealed.
   All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed,
but this act shall not be construed to repeal, change or modify any previous
act, not inconsistent with this act, authorizing the City of New Martinsville
to contract debts or to borrow money or to take away any of the power conferred
by general law upon the said city, or upon the mayor or common council or any
of the officers, except so far as the same may be inconsistent with the power
hereby conferred.
SECTION 40.  Transitional provisions.
   The common council in being at the time this act shall take effect shall
pass all proper orders, and ordinances, to give to this act full force and
effect; and all officers of the city acting as such as the time this act take
effect, shall continue in office until the end of their respective terms, and
until their successors are elected and qualified; to exercise the powers and
perform the duties and receive the compensation heretofore conferred,
prescribed and allowed by a former charter, general law, bylaw or ordinance of
said city.  Such ordinances in force at the time referred to shall continue to
have full operation and effect as ordinances of the City of New Martinsville,

      (5)    Other information as may reasonably be required, touching upon the
applicant's qualifications and fitness for the public service.
   (b)    Applications shall be furnished by the commission, without charge.
The commission may require, in connection with the application, the
certificates of citizens, physicians and others, having pertinent knowledge
concerning the applicant, as the good of the service may require.
   (c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of article five [§§11-5-1 et seq.],
chapter eleven of the West Virginia Code, a person may not submit an
application for original appointment if the person is less than eighteen years
of age or more than forty years of age at the date of the individual's
application.
   (d)    Notwithstanding the requirements established in this section, if an
applicant formerly served upon the paid police department of the city to which
he or she makes application, for a period of more than his or her probationary
period, and resigned from the department at a time when there were no charges
of misconduct or other misfeasance pending against the applicant, within a
period of two years next preceding the date of his or her application, and at
the time of his or her application resides within the corporate limits of the
city in which the paid police department to which the individual seeks
appointment by reinstatement is located, then the individual shall be eligible
for appointment by reinstatement in the discretion of the policemen's civil
service commission. The applicant may be over the age of forty years. The
applicant, providing his or her former term of service so justifies, may be
appointed by reinstatement to the paid police department without a competitive
examination, but the applicant shall undergo a medical examination. The
applicant shall be the lowest in rank in the department next above the
probationers of the department.
131.17  CHARACTER AND NOTICE OF COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS; QUALIFICATIONS OF
APPLICANTS; PRESS REPRESENTATIVES; POSTING ELIGIBLE LIST; MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS.
   All competitive examinations for appointments or promotions to all positions
shall be practical in their character, and shall relate to such matters, and
include such inquiries, as will fairly and fully test the comparative merit and
fitness of the individual or individuals examined to discharge the duties of
the employment sought by him or them. All competitive examinations shall be
open to all applicants who have fulfilled the preliminary requirements
specified in the other civil service provisions of this article.
   Adequate public notice of the date, time and place of every competitive
examination together with information as to the kind of position to be filled,
shall be given at least one week prior to such competitive examination. The
said commission shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations for permitting the
presence of representatives of the press at any such competitive examination.
The commission shall post, in a public place at its office, the eligible list,
containing the names and grades of those who have passed such competitive
examinations for positions in the paid police department, and shall indicate
thereon such appointments as may be made from said list.
   All applicants for appointment or promotion to any position in a paid police
department of a Class I or Class II city who have passed the competitive
examination specified above shall, before being appointed or promoted, undergo
a medical examination which shall be conducted under the supervision of a board
composed of two doctors of medicine appointed for such purpose by the
appointing officer of the city. Such board must certify that an applicant is
free from any bodily or mental defects, deformity or diseases which might
incapacitate him from the performance of the duties of the position desired and
is physically fit to perform such duties before said applicant shall be
appointed or promoted to any position. Notwithstanding the first sentence of
this paragraph, in the event the commission deems it expedient, the medical
examination may be given prior to the competitive examination, and if the
medical examination is not passed as aforesaid, the applicant shall not be
admitted to the competitive examination.
131.18  INDIVIDUAL REVIEW OF TEST AND ANSWERS FROM PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATION.
   (a)    Any applicant for promotion to any position in a paid police
department may personally review such applicant's examination questions,
answers and scores to all parts of any competitive examination within five days
after the posting of results of the competitive examination. Such five days
shall not include the day the examination results are posted, nor any day that
the office of the recorder of the city is not open for business to the public.
The commission shall not certify the list of eligibles until all procedures
before the commission under this section have been exhausted. The commission
shall provide any applicant requesting review of such applicant's examination
questions, answers and scores with a location to review such materials.
   (b)    If any applicant feels aggrieved by the answers and/or scores
received on a promotional competitive examination, the commission shall, at the
request of such applicant made within five days as calculated above, appoint a
date, time and place for a public hearing, at which time such applicant may
appear, with or without counsel. The commission shall review all parts of the
competitive examination questions, answers and scores of the aggrieved
applicant, and testimony shall be taken.
   The commission shall subpoena, at the expense of the applicant, any
competent witnesses requested by such applicant.
   (c)    After such review, the commission shall render a decision either in
favor of the applicant, and therefore adjust the certified eligibility list to
provide for such applicant's adjusted score, or the commission shall rule that
the applicant's prior score should remain unchanged. Any decision rendered by
the commission under this section shall be in writing and shall set forth
findings of fact and conclusions of law relied upon to reach such decision.
   (d)    The commission shall not certify a list of eligibles after the
completion of a competitive promotional examination until all applicants for
such position have exhausted the procedures before the commission set forth in
this section.
   (e)    If any applicant is aggrieved by a decision rendered by the
commission under this section, such applicant may, within twenty days of the
date of the commission's decision, seek judicial review thereof in the circuit
court of the county wherein such municipality is located. Nothing in this
section shall be construed as depriving such applicant of the right to seek a
writ of mandamus to the appropriate court within the time specified in this
subsection.
131.19  REFUSAL TO EXAMINE OR CERTIFY; REVIEW THEREOF.
   The commission may refuse to examine an applicant, or after examination to
certify as eligible one, who is found to lack any of the established
preliminary requirements for the examination or position for which he applies;
or who is physically so disabled as to be rendered unfit for the performance of
the duties of the position desired; or who is addicted to the habitual use of
intoxicating liquors or drugs; or who has been guilty of any crime or of
infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct; or who has been dismissed from
public service for delinquency or misconduct; or who has made a false statement
of any material fact, or practiced or attempted to practice any deception or
fraud, in his application, in any such examination, or in securing his
eligibility; or who refuses to comply with the rules and regulations of the
commission.
   If any applicant feels aggrieved by the action of the commission in refusing
to examine him, or after examination in refusing to certify him as eligible,
the commission shall, at the request of such applicant, appoint a date, time
and place for a public hearing; at which time such applicant may appear, by
himself or counsel, or both, and the commission shall then review its refusal
to make such examination or certification, and testimony shall be taken. The
commission shall subpoena, at the expense of the applicant, any competent
witnesses requested by him. After such review, the commission shall file in its
records the testimony taken and shall again make a decision, which decision
shall be final and not subject to judicial review, but under no circumstances
shall the provisions of this article be construed, in the case of a refusal to
examine an applicant for promotion or to certify an applicant as eligible for
promotion, as depriving such applicant of his right to seek a writ of mandamus,
if the application for such writ is made within twenty days from the date of
the decision refusing to examine or to certify him as eligible for promotion.
131.20  APPOINTMENTS FROM LIST OF ELIGIBLES.
    Every position, unless filled by promotion, reinstatement or reduction,
shall be filled only in the manner specified in this section. The appointing
officer shall notify the policemen's civil service commission of any vacancy in
a position which he desires to fill, and shall request the certification of
eligibles. The commission shall forthwith certify, from the eligible list, the
names of the three individuals thereon who received the highest averages at
preceding competitive examinations held under the civil service provisions of
this article within a period of three years next preceding the date of the
prospective appointment. The appointing officer shall, thereupon, with sole
reference to the relative merit and fitness of the candidates, make an
appointment from the three names so certified: Provided, That should he make
objection, to the commission, to one or more of these individuals, for any of
the reasons stated in section fourteen of this article, and should such
objection be sustained by the commission, after a public hearing along the
lines of the hearing provided for in said section fourteen of this article, if
any such hearing is requested, the commission shall thereupon strike the name
of any such individual from the eligible list, and certify the next highest
name for each individual so stricken. As each subsequent vacancy occurs, in the
same or another position, precisely the same procedure shall be followed:
Provided, however, That after any name has been three times rejected for the
same or another position in favor of a name or names below it on the same list,
the said name shall be stricken from the list.
   When there are a number of positions of the same kind to be filled at the
same time, each appointment shall, nevertheless, be made separately and in
accordance with the foregoing provisions. When an appointment is made under the
provisions of this section it shall be, in the first instance, for the
probationary period of one year, as provided in section eleven [§8-14-11]  of
article fourteen, chapter eight of the West Virginia Code.
131.21  NONCOMPETITIVE EXAMINATION FOR FILLING VACANCY; PROVISIONAL
APPOINTMENT.
   Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a vacancy in any position in a
paid police department of a Class I or Class II city and there is no list of
individuals eligible for appointment after a competitive examination, the
appointing officer may nominate an individual to the policemen's civil service
commission for noncompetitive examination; and if such nominee shall be
certified by the said commission as qualified, after such noncompetitive
examination and a medical examination, he may be appointed provisionally, to
fill such vacancy until a selection and appointment can be made after
competitive examination, in the manner prescribed in section fifteen [§8-14-15]
of article fourteen, chapter eight of the West Virginia Code; but such
provisional appointment shall not continue for a longer period than three
months, nor shall successive provisional appointments be made to the same
position, under the provisions of this section.
131.22  VACANCIES FILLED BY PROMOTION; ELIGIBILITY FOR PROMOTION; RIGHTS OF
CHIEF.
   (a)    Vacancies in positions in a paid police department of a Class I or
Class II city shall be filled, so far as practicable, by promotions from among
individuals holding positions in the next lower grade in the department.
   (b)    Promotions shall be based upon experience and by written competitive
examinations to be provided by the Policemen's Civil Service Commission:
Provided, That except for the chief or deputy chiefs of police, if the position
of deputy chief of police has been previously created by the city council of
that Class I or Class II city, no individual is eligible for promotion from the
lower grade to the next higher grade until the individual has completed at
least two years of continuous service in the next lower grade in the department
immediately prior to the examination: Provided, however, That notwithstanding
the provisions of section six of this article, any member of a paid police
department of a Class I or Class II city now occupying the office of chief or
deputy chief of police of that paid police department, or hereafter appointed
to the office of chief or deputy chief of police, except as hereinafter
provided in this section, is entitled to all of the rights and benefits of the
civil service provisions of this article, except that he or she may be removed
from the office of chief or deputy chief of police without cause, and the time
spent by the member in the office of chief or deputy chief of police shall be
added to the time served by the member during the entire time he or she was a
member of that paid police department prior to his or her appointment as chief
or deputy chief of police, and shall in all cases of removal, except for
removal for good cause, retain the regular rank within that paid police
department which he or she held at the time of his or her appointment to the
office of chief or deputy chief of police or which he or she has attained
during his or her term of service as chief or deputy chief of police.
   (c)    The provisions of this section apply and inure to the benefit of all
individuals who have ever been subject to the provisions of this article. The
commission may determine in each instance whether an increase in salary
constitutes a promotion.
131.23  NO INQUIRY SHALL BE MADE CONCERNING POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS OR
AFFILIATIONS OF APPLICANTS, ETC.
   No question in any form of application or in or during any examination shall
be so framed as to elicit information concerning the political or religious
opinions or affiliations of any applicant; nor shall inquiry be made concerning
such opinions or affiliations; and all disclosures thereof shall be
discountenanced. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened or promised
by any individual in a paid police department of a Class I or Class II city
against, or in favor of, an applicant, eligible, or member of such a paid
police department because of his political or religious opinions or
affiliations.
131.24  POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF MEMBERS PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    A member of a paid police department may not:
      (1)    Solicit any assessment, subscription or contribution for any
political party, committee or candidate from any person who is a member or
employee of the municipality by which they are employed;
      (2)    Use any official authority or influence, including, but not
limited to, the wearing by a municipal police officer of his or her uniform for
the purpose of interfering with or affecting the nomination, election or defeat
of any candidate or the passage or defeat of any ballot issue: Provided, That
this subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit any municipal police
officer from casting his or her vote at any election while wearing his or her
uniform;
      (3)    Coerce or command anyone to pay, lend or contribute anything of
value to a party, committee, organization, agency or person for the nomination,

   (b)    Other types of partisan or nonpartisan political activities not
inconsistent with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section are
permissible political activities for municipal police officers.
   (c)    No person may be appointed or promoted to or demoted or dismissed
from any position held by a municipal police officer or in any way favored or
discriminated against because of his or her engagement in any political
activities authorized by the provisions of this section. Any elected or
appointed official who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by the penalties
contained in section twenty-six [§8-15-26], article fifteen, chapter eight of
the West Virginia Code.
   (d)    Any member of any such paid police department violating the
provisions of this section shall have his appointment vacated and he shall be
removed, in accordance with the pertinent provisions of this section.
   (e)    Any three residents of any such city may file their written petition
with the policemen's civil service commission thereof setting out therein the
grounds upon which a member of the paid police department of such city should
be removed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section. Notice of the
filing of such petition shall be given by said commission to the accused
member, which notice shall require the said member to file a written answer to
the charges set out in the petition within thirty days of the date of said
notice. The said petition and answer thereto, if any, shall be entered upon the
records of the commission. If such answer is not filed within the time stated,
or any extension thereof for cause which in the discretion of the commission
may be granted, an order shall be entered by the commission declaring the
appointment of said member vacated; if such answer is filed within the time
stated, or any extension thereof for cause which in the discretion of the
commission may be granted, the accused member may demand within such period a
public hearing on the charges, or the commission may, in its discretion and
without demand therefor, set a time for a public hearing on said charges, which
hearing shall be within thirty days of the filing of said answer, subject,
however, to any continuances which may in the discretion of the commission be
granted. A written record of all testimony taken at such hearing shall be kept
and preserved by the commission, which record shall be sealed and not be open
to public inspection, if no appeal be taken from the action of the commission.
The commission at the conclusion of the hearing, or as soon thereafter as
possible, shall enter an order sustaining, in whole or in part, the charges
made or shall dismiss the charges as unfounded. In the event the charges are
sustained in whole or in part, the order shall also declare the appointment of
said member to be vacated and thereupon the proper municipal authorities shall
immediately remove said member from the police force and from the payroll of
said city. Notice of the action of the commission shall be given by registered
letter to the mayor and chief of police of the city; and for failure to
immediately comply with the order of the commission such officer or officers
shall be punished for contempt, upon application of the commission to the
circuit court of the county in which the city or the major portion of the
territory thereof is located.
   (f)    An appeal from the ruling of the commission may be had in the same
manner and within the same time as specified in section twenty [§8-14-20] of
article fourteen, chapter eight of the West Virginia Code for an appeal from a
ruling of a commission after hearing held in accordance with the provisions of
said section.
131.25  REMOVAL, DISCHARGE, SUSPENSION OR REDUCTION IN RANK OR PAY; HEAING;
ATTORNEY FEES; APPEAL; REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF MEMBERS.
   (a)    No member of any paid police department subject to the civil service
provisions of this article may be removed, discharged, suspended or reduced in
rank or pay except for just cause, which may not be religious or political,
except as provided in  section nineteen [§8-14-19] of article fourteen, chapter
eight of the West Virginia Code; and no such member may be removed, discharged,
suspended or reduced in rank or pay except as provided by the civil service
provisions of this article, and in no event until the member has been furnished
with a written statement of the reasons for the action. In every case of such
removal, discharge, suspension or reduction, a copy of the statement of reasons
therefor and of the written answer thereto, if the member desires to file such
written answer, shall be furnished to the policemen's civil service commission
and entered upon its records. If the member demands it, the commission shall
grant a public hearing, which hearing shall be held within a period of ten days
from the filing of the charges in writing or the written answer thereto,
whichever shall last occur. At the hearing, the burden shall be upon the
removing, discharging, suspending or reducing officer, hereinafter in this
section referred to as "removing officer", to show just cause for his or her
action, and in the event the removing officer fails to show just cause for the
action before the commission, then the member shall be reinstated with full
pay, forthwith and without any additional order, for the entire period during
which the member may have been prevented from performing his or her usual
employment, and no charges may be officially recorded against the member's
record. The member, if reinstated or exonerated, shall, if represented by legal
counsel, be awarded reasonable attorney fees to be determined by the commission
and paid by the governing body. A written record of all testimony taken at the
hearing shall be kept and preserved by the commission, which record shall be
sealed and not be open to public inspection unless an appeal is taken from the
action of the commission.
   (b)    In the event the commission sustains the action of the removing
officer, the member has an immediate right of appeal to the circuit court of
the county wherein the city or the major portion of the territory thereof is
located. In the event that the commission reinstates the member, the removing
officer has an immediate right of appeal to the circuit court. In the event
either the removing officer or the member objects to the amount of the attorney
fees awarded to the member, the objecting party has an immediate right of
appeal to the circuit court. Any appeal must be taken within ninety days from
the date of entry by the commission of its final order. Upon an appeal being
taken and docketed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county, the
circuit court shall proceed to hear the appeal upon the original record made
before the commission and no additional proof may be permitted to be
introduced. The circuit court's decision is final, but the member or removing
officer, as the case may be, against whom the decision of the circuit court is
rendered has the right to petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of
the circuit court's decision as in other civil cases. The member or removing
officer also has the right, where appropriate, to seek, in lieu of an appeal, a
writ of mandamus. The member, if reinstated or exonerated by the circuit court
or by the supreme court of appeals, shall, if represented by legal counsel, be
awarded reasonable attorney fees as approved by the court and the fees shall be
paid by the governing body.
   (c)    The removing officer and the member shall at all times, both before
the commission and upon appeal, be given the right to employ counsel to
represent them.
   (d)    If for reasons of economy or other reasons it is deemed necessary by
any Class I or Class II city to reduce the number of paid members of its paid
police department, the city shall follow the procedure set forth in this
subsection. The reduction in members of the paid police department of the city
shall be effected by suspending the last person or persons, including
probationers, who have been appointed to the paid police department. The
removal shall be accomplished by suspending the number desired in the inverse
order of their appointment: Provided, That in the event the said paid police
department is increased in numbers to the strength existing prior to the
reduction of members, the members suspended under the terms of this subsection
shall be reinstated in the inverse order of their suspension before any new
appointments to said paid police department are made.

shall apply within such city, town or village. If a majority of all of the
legal votes cast on this question be for police civil service, then all of the
civil service provisions of this article shall apply within such city, town or
village with like effect as if such Class III city or Class IV town or village

department) shall be considered to have been appointed as members under the
civil service provisions of this article and shall hold their positions as
members in accordance therewith. All members of the paid police department of

village operating under police civil service on the effective date of this
article.
131.27  OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.

ARTICLE EXCLUSIVE; STATUS OR TENURE NOT AFFECTED; CERTAIN MEMBERS AUTOMATICALLY
COVERED; CONTINUANCE OF POLICE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEMS.

city who were employed by such city on the effective date of the transition of
such city to a Class II city and who, as of such date, have had four or more

effect, in the case of a Class III city or Class IV town or village, as if such
Class III city or Class IV town or village were a Class I or Class II city),
and shall not be affected by the transition from one class of municipal
corporation to a lower class as specified in section three [§8-1-3], article
one, chapter eight of the West Virginia Code.

This appointment shall be made by the officer or body who in the first instance
appointed the member who is no longer a member. Each of the three members shall
elect one of their number to act as president of the board, who shall serve as
president for one year. In the event that a member has had a part in the
investigation or interrogation of an accused officer or is related by
consanguinity or affinity to an accused officer, that member shall be recused
from participation in the accused officer's hearing. In such an instance, the
officer or body who in the first instance appointed the recused member shall
appoint another person for the sole purpose of the accused officer's hearing.
No member shall hold any other office (other than the office of notary public)
under the United States, this state, or any municipality, county or other
political subdivision thereof; nor shall any member serve on any political

      (d)    Any member of a hearing board appointed under paragraph (b) or (c)
of this subdivision may be removed as provided in this paragraph.
The mayor of the municipality may, at any time, remove any hearing board member
for good cause, which shall be stated in writing and made a part of the records
of the hearing board. However, within ten days of removing any member, the
mayor shall file in the circuit clerk's office of the county in which the
municipality is located a petition setting forth in full the reason for the
removal and seeking the circuit court's confirmation of the mayor's removal of
the member. The mayor shall file a copy of the petition with the removed member
at the same time it is filed with the circuit clerk. The petition shall have
precedence on the circuit court's docket and shall be heard as soon as
practicable on the request of the removed member. All rights vested in a
circuit court by this subsection may be exercised by the judge thereof in
vacation. In the event that no term of the circuit court is being held at the
time the petition is filed, and the judge thereof cannot be reached in the
county in which the petition was filed, the petition shall be heard at the next
succeeding circuit court term, whether regular or special, and the removed
member shall remain removed until a hearing is held on the petition. The court
or the judge thereof in vacation shall hear and decide the issues presented by
the petition. The party affected adversely by the court's or judge's decision
shall have the right to petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of
the decision as in other civil cases. If the mayor fails to file the petition
with the circuit clerk's office within ten days as provided above, the removed
member shall immediately resume his or her position as a hearing board member.
Any resident of the municipality shall have the right at any time to seek the
removal of any hearing board member. To do so, the resident shall file a
petition in the circuit clerk's office of the county where the municipality is
located. The resident shall also serve a copy of the petition on the member
sought to be removed. The petition shall be matured for hearing and heard by
the circuit court or the judge thereof in vacation in the same manner as civil
proceedings in the circuit courts of this state are heard. Any party adversely
affected by the circuit court's or judge's decision shall have the right to
petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of the decision as in other
civil cases.

times during such interrogation.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the immediate temporary suspension, pending an
investigation, from duty of any police officer or fireman who reports for duty

139.06  COMPLAINT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file with
the Fair Housing Board, within three hundred sixty days of the alleged
violation, a complaint in writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state the
name and address of the person aggrieved; the name and address of the person
against whom the complaint is filed; a description and the address of the
dwelling which is involved with the alleged discriminatory housing practice; a
concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates, constituting the
alleged discriminatory housing practice; and such other information as may be
required by the Board. The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended. The
Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint, the secretary of the Board shall make
such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the filing
of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed necessary by
the chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the secretary shall determine that
there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall
attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
any member of the board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the state
real estate commission, state human rights commission, the U. S Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)    If the secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this article, he shall so inform the
Board, and the Board may, in its discretion, dismiss such complaint or order
such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall
not dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity
to appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this article, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board, and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
article has been committed. The board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board, prior to the hearing
date, as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board, and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of the
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this article. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this article, the Board shall, after consultation with the City
Attorney in executive session, state its findings to and cause the City
Attorney to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this article,
with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the Secretary , determines
that the person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar days
following service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board will
recertify the matter to the City Attorney for enforcement. The City Attorney
shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the
Fair Housing Board of the City before the Circuit Court of the County.
   (h)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this article, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.
(1-11-79)
139.07  OTHER REMEDIES.

entitled or from filing any complaint with any other agency or court of law or
equity

otherwise admitted to bail, and who shall willfully and without just cause fail
to appear as and when it may be required, may be apprehended and brought before
the court by capias.
   (b)   Any person, who has been issued a citation or summons to appear, or

171.14  BAIL BONDS AND CASH DEPOSITS IN LIEU THEREOF.
   Except as may be provided otherwise in any case by State law, the Codified
Ordinances, or other ordinance, whenever any person is arrested for any
violation of an ordinance of the City or for any offense of which the Municipal
Judge has jurisdiction, the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk,
or person in charge of Police Headquarters may admit such person to bail upon
the execution of a bond to the City in such an amount, not less than twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) nor more than the maximum fine which may be adjudged
against such person for the offense or offenses he is alleged to have committed
plus the costs which could be assessed against him, as in the discretion of the
officer will secure the prisoner's presence, conditioned that the accused will
appear upon a day named, before the Municipal Judge of the City, to await
trial.  Every such bond taken shall be filed as soon as practicable with the
Municipal Court by the officer approving and taking such bond.  The Municipal
Judge, Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk, or person in charge of Police
Headquarters shall each have the power to approve any bond taken under the
provisions of this section, precedence being given to the ranking officer
present when such bond is presented.  No person shall be accepted as surety
upon any penal bond unless he shall acknowledge the bond before some official
duly authorized by the Codified Ordinances or by State law to administer an
oath, and shall make oath that he is the owner in fee of real estate situated
in the County and worth the amount of the bond over and above his debts and
liabilities; but the officers hereinbefore named in this section are hereby
authorized and empowered to accept a deposit in cash of an amount, not less
than the minimum nor more than the maximum hereinbefore specified for a bond,
which, in the judgment of the officer accepting the deposit, will be sufficient
to cause the prisoner's appearance upon the day required of him before the
Municipal Judge to await trial upon the charge against him.  In the event any
person so released upon bond or such deposit shall fail to appear before the
Municipal Judge for trial at the appointing time, or, having appeared, shall
leave the court without awaiting trial, his bond shall be forfeited thereby to
the City, and if a cash deposit has been made to secure his release, the sum so
deposited shall be delivered to the Municipal Judge and by him promptly turned
into the City Treasury to the credit of the General Fund and accounted for by
him in the same manner that fines collected by him are counted for; and in the
event of the forfeiture of a penal bond, the Finance Officer shall forthwith
take the steps necessary at law for the collection thereof.
171.15  PERSONS PROHIBITED TO BE SURETY ON BAIL BONDS.
   No practicing attorney, officer of the Municipal Court or member of the
Police Department shall be accepted as surety on any bond provided for in this
article.
171.16  JURY TRIALS.
   Any defendant in jeopardy of incarceration in any misdemeanor proceeding
before the Municipal Court shall be entitled to a trial by jury unless such
defendant shall affirmatively waive, in writing, such right; provided, however,
the Municipal Court Judge, in their discretion, may signify on the docket in
advance of trial that under no condition will a jail sentence be imposed, and
the foregoing waiver shall not be required and the defendant shall not be
entitled to a trial by jury. In all cases where required by the Constitution or
Statutes of the State, the Municipal Judge shall empanel a jury to hear the
evidence and decide the case.  The Court shall promulgate rules for the
selection and empaneling of jurors in such cases.  All costs incurred in
connection with jury trials shall be awarded against, and be payable by the
party against whom judgment is rendered.
171.17  METHOD OF PAYMENT WHEN DEFENDANT UNABLE TO PAY.
   Whenever a person is convicted in the Municipal Court of a violation of the
Codified Ordinances or other ordinance or any rule, regulation, notice or order
promulgated pursuant to authority thereof, and such person is sentenced to pay
a fine, and it shall appear to the Court on its own motion or on motion of the
defendant that such defendant is unable to pay such fine forthwith, the Court
may order the defendant to pay such fine and any costs which the defendant may
be required to pay in installments or upon such other terms and conditions or
within such period of time as may enable the defendant to pay such fine and
costs. 
171.18  PAYMENT MAY BE CONDITION OF PROBATION OR SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE.
   If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine and payment of the fine and/or
costs is ordered to be made on an installment basis or on other conditions
under the provisions of Section
171.14, and if the defendant is also placed on probation or imposition of the
execution of sentence is suspended, the Municipal Court may make payment of the
fine a condition of probation or suspension of sentence.
171.19  GOOD BEHAVIOR UNTIL FINE AND COSTS ARE PAID.
   If a defendant is permitted to pay a fine and/or costs on an installment
basis, or under such other conditions as the Municipal Court shall fix under
the provisions of Section
171.14, the Court may require as a condition that the defendant be of peace and
good behavior until the fine and costs are paid.
171.20  PROCEDURE UPON DEFAULT IN PAYMENT UNDER AGREEMENT.
   When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of any such
fine or of any installment thereof, the Municipal Court may issue a summons for
such person to appear before the Court for a hearing on the question of whether
such person's failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the Court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith.  The Court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, cause the suspension of driving privileges, or upon a finding that the
default was intentional or due to the lack of a good faith effort to comply
with the prior order of the Court, may order such person charged with Contempt
of Court.
171.21  MUNICIPAL COURT COSTS.
   In addition to any other costs which may be lawfully imposed, an additional
cost shall be imposed for all charges, except violations of municipal parking
violations.
171.22  REINSTATEMENT FEES; DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) is hereby imposed upon any person whose
driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State is
reinstated after having been suspended for any of the following:
   (a)   Failure to timely pay costs, fines, forfeitures or penalties imposed
by the Municipal Court;
   (b)   Default on a payment plan for such costs, fines, forfeitures or
penalties; or
   (c)   Failure to appear or otherwise respond in court when charged with a
municipal violation, all as provided for by the West Virginia Code.
   The fee imposed by this section shall be paid at the time the person's
driver's license or privilege to drive is reinstated by the State Division of
Motor Vehicles. Such fee is imposed to defer the costs to the City associated
with administrative expenses related to the suspension and reinstatement.

disposed of as provided under West Virginia Code Article 17-24.  Any other
vehicle removed under authority of this section shall be ordered into storage
and the Police Department shall forthwith notify the registered vehicle owner
of the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons therefor and the place of
storage.  Any person desiring to redeem an impounded vehicle shall appear at
the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity and
ownership or right to possession.  Prior to issuance of a release form, the
claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due for any fines for
violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or, as the court may
require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to answer to such
violations.  The pound operator shall release such vehicle upon the receipt of
the release form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
303.08  REPORT REQUIRED; NOTICE TO OWNER.
   Any police officer removing or causing any vehicle to be removed and stored
for safe keeping under the provisions of this article shall, as soon as
practicable, make a report of such action to the officer in charge at the
police station, giving in such report the license registration number, state of
registration if any, make and type of vehicle, place of, and reason for,
removal, as well as the place at which stored. If any such vehicle shall not be
claimed within twenty-four hours from and after the time of such report, either
by the owner or the person in charge thereof, the owner of such vehicle shall
be notified by mail of the impounding thereof by the Clerk of the Police Court.
Such notice shall include the facts and matters contained in the report to the
officer in charge and shall also notify such owner of the manner and terms upon
which he may reclaim such vehicle.
303.09  LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR COSTS.
   The owner or person in charge of any vehicle impounded under the provisions
of this article shall pay the costs of impounding, hauling, driving, towing and
storing such vehicle, in addition to any fine and costs assessed against him
for any violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of
the City resulting from the parking of such vehicle or otherwise, or arising
out of any act resulting in the impounding of such vehicle.
303.10  POST-STORAGE HEARINGS FOR IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   (a)   Right to Hearing.  As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to any
ordinance of the City, by its agents or employees, a person who has a legal
entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure
administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound
the vehicle if such person files a written demand on forms so provided for such
a hearing, with the City within five days after such person has learned such
vehicle has been impounded or within five days after the mailing of the date
set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first, the notice of
stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner or
their agent and to the garage where the vehicle is stored within twenty-four
hours, in cases of out-of-state vehicles forty-eight hours, excluding weekends
and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle.
   (b)   Conduct of Hearing.
      (1)   A hearing shall be conducted before the Municipal Police Judge
within twenty-four hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the
person seeking the hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy
hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and City holidays are to be excluded from the
calculation of the twenty-four hour period. The sole issue before the Police
Judge shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in
question.
      (2)    “Probable cause to impound" means such a state of facts as would
lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was
sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   The Police Judge shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the
hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right
to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Police Judge shall prepare a written
decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the
hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle, if not the person requesting
the hearing. The Police Judge's decision in no way affects any criminal
proceeding in connection with the impound in question and that any criminal
charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate
court. The decision of the Police Judge is final. Failure of the registered or
legal owner, or their agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure
hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing.
   (c)   Decision of the Police Judge.  The Police Judge shall only determine
that as to the vehicle in issue either there was probable cause to impound the
vehicle or there was no such probable cause, and in the event that the Police
Judge determines that there was no probable cause, the Police Judge shall
prepare and date a Certificate of No Probable Cause, copies of which shall be
given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt
of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the garage having custody of the
vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor.  Upon a finding of no
probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the City in accordance
with arrangements made between the City and the garage. If the possessor fails
to present such certificate to the garage having custody of the vehicle within
twenty-four hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the garage is not
open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent
storage charges. Such certificate shall advise the possessor of such
requirement.
303.11  CITY NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
   The City, its agents, officers or employees shall not be liable for any
damages to persons or property resulting directly or indirectly from any act
done or performed under the provisions of this article.

parking lots or elsewhere for the storage and safekeeping of the vehicles
impounded under the provisions of this article and is also authorized to enter
into contracts and agreements for the removal, towing and storage of vehicles
coming within the provisions hereof, with persons having equipment suitable for

thereof within thirty days from and after the date the same is impounded, such
vehicle may be sold at public auction by the Chief of Police of the City, or by
the persons storing the same under provisions of this article, but before any
such sale shall be made, ten days' notice of the date, place and purpose of
such sale with a description of the vehicle to be sold shall be served upon the
owner of record of such vehicle by registered mail at his last known address
and like notice of such sale shall be published once each week for two
successive weeks prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. If the owner of any such vehicle is unknown; then no
notice to such owner shall be necessary but the newspaper publication shall be
made and the facts with regard to the ownership of the vehicle set forth in
such notice.
   In the making of any sale hereunder the Chief of Police may continue the
same by verbal announcement at the time and place of such sale, and in the
making of any such sale of any such vehicle he may act by agent or attorney.
   The proceeds from any such sale of any such vehicle shall be applied, first,
to the costs of such sale; second, to the hauling, towing and storage charges
thereof; third, to the payment of any fine and costs incurred by reason of any
violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of the
City; and fourth, to the payment of any bona fide lien owner who intervenes or
establishes a bona fide claim to such sum. Any balance remaining shall be paid
to the owner of such vehicle, if he is known, or if unknown, shall be paid to
the general receiver of the Circuit Court of the County, to be disposed of by
him as provided by the statutes of the State. In the event that no person shall
claim any such funds in the hands of the general receiver for a period of
twenty years, the principal of such fund together with the interest thereon
shall be paid into the General Fund of the City by the general receiver.
303.14  IMMOBILIZATION OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.
   (a)   Authority of Police.  When any police officer of the City finds on a
City street a vehicle which has in the past been cited for a traffic violation
and which violation has not been disposed of in the Police Court in accordance
with the ordinances pertaining thereto, or which vehicle is in violation of the
provisions of this Traffic Code and the City police officer deems it necessary,
in order to enforce such provisions, that an immobilizer be used, then such
City police officer may immobilize such vehicle by installing or attaching a
device thereto until the owner or driver thereof has satisfied any existing and
past violations in accordance with the ordinances pertaining thereto.
   (b)   Notice.  Whenever any such vehicle is so immobilized, a notice in
writing, on a form to be prescribed by the Police Chief, shall be conspicuously
affixed to such vehicle advising the owner or driver thereof that such vehicle
has been immobilized for violation of the City ordinances enumerated thereon,
and indicating the procedure to obtain the release of such immobilizer.

person shall move any vehicle immobilized pursuant to subsection (a) hereof

from the officer in charge at the City police station.
   (d)   Additional Fine.  The owner or driver of any vehicle which has been

convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
   (b)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of police
officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and areas
contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the Municipality.

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

street or highway construction maintenance work, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk.  Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL  DEVICES.

such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.

Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers
may issue citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the
illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on
the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or

the business establishment of a demolisher.
   (d)   Old Vehicle Tires; Abandoned Household Appliances.  No person shall,
within this City, place or deposit any old vehicle tires or inoperative
household appliance upon the right-of-way of any public highway or upon any

does not own, lease, rent or otherwise control, unless it be a licensed
salvaged yard or at the business establishment of a demolisher.
   (e)     Authority to Take Possession of Abandoned Vehicles; Enforcement;
Notification to Owner.  Any enforcement agency which has knowledge of or
discovers or finds any abandoned motor vehicle, any junk motor vehicle, old
vehicle tire or inoperative or abandoned household appliance on either public
or private property shall take the same into its custody and possession.  For
that purpose, the enforcement agency shall employ its own personnel, equipment
and facility or hire persons, equipment and facilities for the purpose of
removing, preserving and storing abandoned motor vehicles, junk motor vehicles,
old vehicle tires, or inoperative or abandoned household appliances.  Before
taking any abandoned motor vehicle or junk motor vehicle into custody and
possession from private property, the enforcement agency shall give the private
property owner and the owner of such motor vehicle, if ascertainable, thirty
days notice by registered or certified mail, that such action shall be taken
unless such motor vehicle is restored to a functional use.
   (f)   Notification of Vehicle Owner and Lien Holders.
      (1)   The enforcement agency which takes into custody and possession an
abandoned motor vehicle or a junk motor vehicle shall, within seven days after
taking custody and possession thereof, notify the last known registered owner
of such motor vehicle and all lien holders of record that such motor vehicle
has been taken into custody and possession, such notification to be by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
         The notice shall contain the following:
         A.    Description of such motor vehicle, including the year, make,
model, manufacturer's serial or identification number, or any other number
which may have been assigned to such motor vehicle by the State and any
distinguishing marks;
         B.    Set forth the location of the facility where such motor vehicle
is being held and the location where such motor vehicle was taken into custody
and possession;
         C.   Inform the owner and any lien holders of record of their right to
reclaim such motor vehicle within ten days after the date notice was received
by the owner or lien holders upon payment of all towing, preservation and
storage charges resulting from taking and placing such motor vehicle into
custody and possession; and
         D.   State that the failure of the owner or lien holders of record to
exercise their right to reclaim such motor vehicle within such ten day period
shall be deemed a waiver of the owner and lien holders of record of all right,
title and interest in such motor vehicle and of their consent to the sale or
disposal of the abandoned motor vehicle or junk motor vehicle at a public
auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.
      (2)   If the identity of the last registered owner of the abandoned motor
vehicle or junk motor vehicle cannot be determined, or if the certificate of
registration or certificate of title contains no address for the owner, or if
it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
address of all lien holders, notice shall be published as a Class I legal
advertisement in compliance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 59-3-1 et
seq., and the publication area for such publication shall be the City wherein
such motor vehicle was located at the time such enforcement agency took custody
and possession thereof, and such notice shall be sufficient to meet all
requirements of notice pursuant to this article.  Any notice by publication may
contain multiple listings of abandoned motor vehicles and junk motor vehicles. 
The notice shall be published within ten days after such motor vehicle is taken
into custody and possession and shall have the same contents required for a
notice pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, except that the ten day period shall
run from the date such notice is published as aforesaid.
      (3)   The consequences and effect of failure to reclaim an abandoned
motor vehicle or junk motor vehicle within the ten day period after notice is
received by registered or certified mail or within ten days after the notice is
published in a newspaper as aforesaid shall be set forth in such notice.

reclaimed as provided for in subsection (f) hereof, the enforcement agency in
possession of the abandoned motor vehicle or junk motor vehicle shall sell it
either at a public auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.  The
purchaser of such motor vehicle shall take title to such motor vehicle free and
clear of all liens and claims of ownership and shall receive a sales receipt
from the enforcement agency which disposed of such motor vehicle.  The sales
receipt at such sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of
transferring such motor vehicle to a licensed salvage yard or to a demolisher
for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and no further titling of such motor
vehicle shall be necessary by either the purchaser at the auction, the licensed
salvage yard or the demolisher, who shall be exempt from the payment of any
fees and taxes required pursuant to the West Virginia Code 17A-3-1 et seq.;
provided, that the purchaser at the auction shall place such motor vehicle in
the possession of a licensed salvage yard or demolisher within twenty days from
the date he purchases such motor vehicle; and if such licensed salvage yard or
demolisher does not demolish such vehicle, such licensed salvage yard or
demolisher shall be required to pay all fees and taxes required pursuant to
West Virginia Code Article 17A-3.
      (2)   When an enforcement agency has in its custody and possession old
vehicle tires or inoperative or abandoned household appliances collected in
accordance with subsection (f) hereof, it shall sell such property from time to
time at public auction, or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.
   (h)   Proceeds from Sale.
      (1)   From the proceeds of the sale, the Police Department shall
reimburse itself for any expenses it may have incurred in conducting the
auction, and costs of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle which resulted
from placing the abandoned vehicle in custody and all notice and publication
costs incurred pursuant to this article.
      (2)   Any remainder from the proceeds of sale after payment of  these
costs shall be held for the last registered owner of the vehicle or entitled
lien holder for ninety days, after which time, if no owner or lien holder
claims the remainder, it shall be deposited in the City Treasury to be kept and
maintained as a special revolving account designated as the Abandoned Vehicle
Disposal Account and any monies so collected and deposited shall be used solely
by the Police Department for the payment of auction, towing, preserving,
storage and all notice and publication costs which result from placing other
abandoned vehicles in custody, whenever the proceeds from the sale of those
abandoned vehicles are insufficient to meet these expenses and costs.
      (3)   The abandoned vehicle disposal account shall be under the direction
and control of the City Recorder, who shall assure that all the money is
properly deposited in the account by the Police Department and that any money
necessary to pay costs and expenses of those sales, as specified in the
preceeding paragraph are disbursed in accordance with required accounting
procedures applicable to law enforcement agencies selling abandoned vehicles.
      (4)   The abandoned vehicles disposal account shall never be maintained
in excess of the amount necessary to efficiently and properly carry out the
intentions of this article and in no event shall the abandoned vehicle disposal
account be maintained in excess of the sum of one thousand dollars ($1000); and
whenever the abandoned vehicle disposal account exceeds that amount, the City
Recorder shall transfer the excess to the General Revenue Fund.
   (i)   Injunctive Relief.  In addition to all other remedies provided for in
this section, the City Attorney may apply to the Circuit Court for an

abandoned motor vehicles, junk motor vehicles, old vehicle tires or inoperative
or abandoned household appliances which are in violation of any provisions of
this section.

allow to be stored, accumulate or exist on real estate within the City any
junk, disabled and non-serviceable automobiles, automobile bodies, automobile
parts and other debris.
      (2)   In addition to the penalty provided below, the City, in order to
abate such nuisance, shall have the power and authority to order the removal of
such nuisance by giving the owner of the property, or the person in lawful
possession thereof, ten days notice and in the event such nuisance is not
abated within ten days, the City shall have such right to abate such nuisance
and remove any junk, disabled and non-serviceable automobiles, automobile
bodies, automobile parts and other debris and charge the expense thereof
against such property, and the expense of removing and abating such nuisance
shall constitute a lien against such property.

curb so as not to unduly impede the movement of other vehicular traffic.
   (d)   The operator of a taxicab shall not stand or park such vehicle upon
any street at any place other than in a taxicab stand so designated and posted

any place for the purpose of and while actually engaged in the expeditious
loading or unloading of passengers.

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

taxable court costs, and interest from date of judgment.  The right of action
and remedy granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any

tortious acts of his or their children heretofore existing under the provisions
of any law, statutory or otherwise, or now so existing independently of the

Municipality, prima facie the time when observed in the Municipal
Administrative Offices and Police Station.
      (5)   "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth
to, but not including the day of the next, such as the eighteenth birthday,
making it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as
equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen years of age."
   (b)   Curfew Hours.  No person seventeen or less years of age shall be in or
upon any public place during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
         A.   At 10:00 p.m. for minors twelve or less years of age;
         B.   At 11:00 p.m. for minors thirteen through fifteen years of age;
and
         C.    At 12:00 midnight for minors sixteen or more years of age.

of a minor in that parent's legal custody.  It is intented to continue to keep
neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard to
parental responsibility through an objective test.  It shall, a fortiori, be no
defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct

549.10   Appeals and enforcement.
549.11   Severability.
 
549.01  PURPOSE; PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   Council may, by resolution, abate anything which, in the opinion of a
majority of Council, constitutes a public nuisance after due notice to all
parties that could be affected and after such hearings as Council deems
necessary to ascertain a factual and rational basis for the abatement of any
such public nuisance.
549.02  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE.
   The provisions of this article shall apply to all nuisances as hereinafter
designated which are now in existence or which may hereafter exist in the City.
549.03  DEFINITION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   A public nuisance is one which affects an indefinite number of persons, or
the residents of a particular locality, or people coming within the extent of
its range or operation, although the extent of the annoyance or damage
inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.  Such public nuisance endangers the
health, safety and welfare of the community and is dangerous and detrimental to
the public health, may violate the laws of the City and/or State as well as
obstructs the community from reasonable and comfortable use of property.
   A nuisance may arise from the unreasonable, unwarrantable or unlawful
behavior associated with the property, either real or personal, which hinders
the neighboring community and the general public from enjoying the common and
public rights enjoyed by the general community in like areas where no such
nuisance exists.
549.04  CONTINUING NUISANCE.
   An uninterrupted or periodically recurring nuisance; not necessarily a
constant or unceasing injury, but a nuisance which occurs so often and is so
necessarily an incident of the use of property complained of that it can fairly
be said to be continuous.  Such a nuisance may be of such character that its
continuance is necessarily an injury which will continue without change. 
549.05  REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNCIL; HEARING.
     Public safety and law enforcement officers, as well as affected members of
the community, shall report findings and recommendations to the appropriate
department head; and if the department head ascertains from the report and
findings that the condition presents a public nuisance, as herein defined, the
department head shall make their recommendation to Council that just cause
exists to abate the nuisance. Whereupon by a majority vote of Council, a
hearing shall be held after at least ten days' notice to the property owner,
tenant, business manager and/or licensee of the time and place of such hearing,
which notice shall contain a statement or specification of the charges, grounds
or reasons for such proposed contemplated action, and which shall be served
upon the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or licensee as notices
under the West Virginia rules of civil procedure or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and shall, in addition, be posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises as well as within 100 feet surrounding such premises affected by
the recommendation.  The term "cause" shall include the doing or omitting of
any act or permitting any condition to exist which causes a public or
continuing nuisance as defined in this article. At which time and place, so
designated in the notice, the City Administration shall put forth its evidence
in support of the recommendation made to Council as well as the property owner,
tenant, business manager and/or licensee shall have the right to appear and
produce evidence in his behalf, and to be represented by counsel.  Provided
that the Council may forthwith suspend any such license when they believe the
public safety will be adversely affected by the continued operation of such
nuisance.
   If, at the request of the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee or on his motion, the hearing shall be continued and shall not take
place on the day fixed by the Council, the property owner, tenant, business
manager and/or licensee shall not be permitted to continue doing business
pending an appeal as provided by this article.
549.06  PERMANENT NUISANCE FURTHER DEFINED.
   In addition to the definitions provided above, a permanent nuisance is also
a nuisance of such a character that its continuance is necessarily an injury
which will continue without change, unless Council takes such action to cease
any like nuisance from becoming established and reoccurring at the particular
location.  It is not enough to show a slight interference to the public welfare
and such will not be restrained unless the type of business or manner of
operation is injurious to the public health, safety and welfare of the
community or has a tendency to promote unlawful behavior or behavior which is
considered by the City Administration, including its health and/or safety
officials, to be a menace to public order and safety.
549.07  DECLARATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   If upon review of information presented to Council it can be shown that
acts, occupations, types of businesses or structures which are generally not
considered nuisances at all times and under any circumstances are found to have
become nuisances by reason of the circumstances or the location and
surroundings, the Council may declare by majority vote of Council such a
nuisance-in-fact. Upon a showing that there has been a continuing nuisance of
similar character and circumstances at a particular location and surrounding
area existing in an uninterrupted or periodically reoccurring fashion, Council
may declare such a permanent nuisance and therefore permanently revoke and
withhold further licensure or approval of similar acts, occupations, types of
businesses or structures at such location.  However, for industrial and
commercial zones which permit commercial establishments, the declaration of a
permanent nuisance as stated in this article and section shall not apply.
Council may consider primarily reports of safety and law enforcement officials,
as well as public comment and complaints of the community spanning at a minimum
a three-year period, at a minimum, when considering declaring a particular
permanent nuisance. The Municipality is entitled to seek appropriate judicial
relief against such public nuisances which are believed to be permanent in
nature and judicial proceedings and adjudication by a court of competent
jurisdiction may be sought.
549.08  ABATEMENT BY MUNICIPALITY.
   After any hearings as defined herein and upon the declaration of the
Municipality that a public nuisance exists, an order to abate such nuisance
shall issue.  If means short of destruction would abate the nuisance, such must
be employed.  The order shall prohibit a further use constituting a nuisance.
549.09  RECONSIDERATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   Should such a location be declared a permanent public nuisance, any further
use of that location for the same purpose is not allowed and after three months
of the date that such property is declared a permanent nuisance, the property
would lose its non-conforming use status and revert to the land use permitted
in accord with the Planning and Building Code. However, reconsideration of a
Declaration of a Permanent Nuisance may occur if such request is filed within
three (3) months of such order declaring a permanent nuisance.  Another
business or non-conforming use may petition City Council for a hearing to
demonstrate that a legitimate business interest or other non-conforming use is
proposed for such location.  If such petition is granted, a bond shall be
posted in an amount not less than $25,000.00 to extend for a minimum of one
year from the date of occupation of the premises.  Such one-year period shall
be considered probationary in that any recurrence of similar activity which
leads to the prior declaration of a nuisance or would lead to a new nuisance
violation shall be cause for immediate forfeiture of said bond to the City of
New Martinsville and closure of such establishment upon notice by the City
Council.
549.10  APPEALS AND ENFORCEMENT.
   In the event that such property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee may be aggrieved by such declared abatement which may include and not
be limited to revocation or suspension of any licensures and/or the restricted
use of such property having been declared a nuisance, petition for such review
must be filed with the circuit court within a period of thirty days from and
after the date of final action by Council. Any property owner, tenant, business
manager and/or licensee obtaining an order for such review shall be required to
pay the costs and fees incident to transcribing, certifying and transmitting
the records pertaining to such matter to the circuit court. Any person, firm,
corporation, landowner, or licensee so affected has the right to apply to the
circuit court for a temporary injunction pursuant to the provisions of the W.
Va. Code.  The Municipality is also entitled to any and all appropriate
judicial relief against public nuisances.
549.11  SEVERABILITY.
   If any article, section, subsection, provision, clause, or phrase of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
unconstitutional or invalid, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not
affect other articles, sections, subsections, provisions, clauses or phrases or
applications of the chapter, and to this end each and every article, section,
subsection, provision, clause and phrase of this chapter is declared to be
severable.  The above article is in addition to and not dependent upon other
sections of this Code, in particular sections of the Business and Taxation Code
of the City, which provides that the Council may forthwith suspend, revoke or
alter any such license when they believe the public safety will be adversely
affected by the continued operation of such nuisance.

division. The city recorder shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for
ascertaining such value.
(6-27-77)
   (b)   In determining value as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sales are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale,
the city recorder shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining
the value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as
nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of
like quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
the seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar. (6-27-

ten (10) years shall be eligible to receive a tax credit equal to one hundred
(100%) percent of the business and occupation tax owed for the first ten (10)
tax years commencing on the date such new business is first located or

credit is contingent upon the creation and retention of a minimum of seventy-
five (75) full-time jobs during the first tax year and a minimum of one hundred
(100) full-time jobs during the second through tenth tax years. Such business
shall not be eligible for this tax credit after the tenth tax year.
   (b)   The required number of jobs to be created and retained by such

ordinance shall be based on the actual number of full-time employees, each
working a minimum of thirty-two (32) hours per week, on the payroll of said
business during each calendar quarter being the first day of January, April,
July and October of the year in which such tax credit is claimed. Any such
employer who does not maintain the designated number of full-time jobs as
provided herein shall be subject to tax liability in accordance with the
provisions of this article.
   (c)   Such business, at its own expense, shall provide to the city recorder
actual copies of its payroll certified as true and accurate by an independent

(12-2-02)
749.13  COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT GENERALLY.
   (a)   The taxes levied under this article shall be due and payable in
quarterly installments on or before the expiration of one month from the end of

expiration of each quarter, make out an estimate of the tax for which he is
liable for such quarter, sign it and mail it, together with a remittance in the
form required by Section
749.22 of the amount of tax to the office of the city recorder. In estimating
the amount of tax due for each quarter, the taxpayer may deduct one-fourth of
the tax credit for industrial expansion allowable for the taxable year and one-
fourth of the total exemption
allowed for the year. When the total tax for which any person is liable under
this article does not exceed one hundred dollars in any year, the taxpayer may
pay the same quarterly as aforesaid or, with the consent in writing of the City
Recorder, at the end of the month next following the use of the tax year.
   (b)   Any other provision of this section notwithstanding, the City
Recorder, if he deems it necessary to insure payment of the tax, may require
the return and payment under this section for periods of shorter duration than
quarter-year periods.
(6-27-77.)
749.14  ANNUAL RETURN AND REMITTANCE.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year, each
taxpayer shall make a return for the entire year, showing the gross proceeds of
sales or gross income of the business, trade or calling, and compute the amount
of tax chargeable against him in accordance with the provisions of this article
and deduct the amount of quarterly payments as hereinbefore provided, if any,
and transmit with his report a remittance in the form required by Section
749.22 covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him, to the office of
the city recorder.  Such return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an
individual, or by the president, vice- president, secretary or treasurer of a
corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a
partnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm,
copartnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf of the taxpayer.
The City Recorder, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the
annual return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable
additional time within which to make the same as may, by him, be deemed
advisable.
(6-27-77)
749.15  CORRECTION OF ERRORS.
   (a)   If the taxpayer shall make any error in computing the tax assessable
against him, the city recorder shall correct such error or reassess the proper
amount of taxes and notify the taxpayer of his action by mailing to him
promptly a copy of the corrected assessment, and any additional tax for which
such taxpayer may be liable shall be paid within ten days after the receipt of
such statement.
   (b)   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on
the basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the City Recorder and shall be
payable out of any funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at his
election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing under this
article.
(6-27-77)
749.16  FAILURE TO MAKE RETURN.
   If any person shall fail or refuse to make a return, either in whole or in
part, or if the city recorder has reasonable ground to believe that any return
made is so deficient as not to form the basis of a satisfactory assessment of
the tax, he may proceed as he deems best to obtain information on which to base
the assessment of the tax. The city recorder may, in person or by duly
appointed agent, make examination of the books, records and papers and audit
the accounts of any such person and may take the evidence, on oath, of any
person whom he may believe shall be in possession of any relevant information. 
As soon as possible after procuring such information as the city recorder may
be able to obtain as to any person failing or refusing to make a return, he
shall proceed to assess the tax and shall notify the person assessed of the
amount of the tax. The assessment of the tax by the city recorder shall be
final as to any person who refuses to make a return.
(6-27-77)
749.17  JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   (a)   If the City Recorder believes that the collection of any tax which he
is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make
an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment. The amount
assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer against whom
a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within twenty
days after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an assessment
becomes final.

assessment has been made must be accompanied by such security as the city
recorder may deem necessary to insure compliance.
(6-27-77)
749.18  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The City Recorder shall give to the taxpayer written notice of any
assessment made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom a notice
of assessment is directed shall, within thirty days thereafter (except in the
case of jeopardy assessments), either personally or by certified mail, file
with the City Recorder a petition in writing, verified under oath by such
taxpayer or his duly appointed agent having knowledge of the facts, setting
forth with definiteness and particularity the items of the assessment objected
to, together with the reason for such objections, such assessment shall become
and be deemed conclusive, and the amount thereof shall be payable at the end of
such thirty day period. In every case where a petition for reassessment as
above described is filed, the City Recorder shall assign a time and place for
the hearing thereof and shall notify the petitioner of such hearing by written
notice at least twenty days in advance thereof, and such hearing shall be held
within sixty days from the filing of the petition for reassessment, unless
continued by agreement or by the City Recorder for good cause. The hearing
shall be informal and may be conducted by an examiner designated by the city
recorder. At such hearing evidence may be offered to support the assessment or
to prove that it is incorrect. After such hearing the city recorder shall,
within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of the decision. Unless an
appeal is taken within thirty days from service of this notice, the city
recorder's decision shall be final.
(6-27-77)
749.19  APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   If any person, having made the return and paid the tax as provided in this
article, feels aggrieved by the assessment so made upon him for any year by the
City Recorder, he may apply to council by petition, in writing, within thirty
days after notice is mailed to him by the City Recorder, for a hearing and
correction of the amount of the tax so assessed upon him by the City Recorder,
in which petition shall be set forth the reasons why such hearing should be
granted and the amount of such tax should be reduced. The Council shall
promptly consider such petition and may grant such hearing or deny it. If
denied, the petitioner shall be forthwith notified thereof; if granted, the
Council shall notify the petitioner of the time and place fixed for such
hearing. After such hearing, the Council may make such order in the matter as
may appear to it just and lawful and shall furnish a copy of such order to the
petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any tax required to be paid by
him may recover the amount so paid, together with interest, in any proper
action or suit against the city as may be authorized by law.
(6-27-77)
749.20  TAX YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes made in this article and the returns required

Recorder, make his annual returns and pay taxes for the year covering his
accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his books.

and taxes levied by this Code and other city ordinances as a condition
precedent to engaging in any business, trade and calling. A person exercising a
privilege taxable herein, subject to the payment of all licenses and charges

the first month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency and one percent of the tax
for each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, that
if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the city recorder may waive or
remit, in whole or in part, these penalties.
   (c)   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade the rules and
regulations promulgated under this article, there shall be added an additional
penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax exclusive of penalties.
   (d)   The penalties so added shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner and as a part of the tax.

749.22, the failure of any taxpayer to make any required return or pay the tax
imposed upon him by this article within five days following the prescribed date
for the filing of such return or the payment of such tax shall constitute good
cause for Council to revoke or to refuse to renew the City license of such
taxpayer to engage in the business taxed hereunder, as well as any other city
business license held by him.

to the effect that said taxes imposed against such subcontractor have been paid
or provided for. And any such general contractor failing to withhold as
provided herein, shall be personally liable for the payment of such taxes
attributable to the contract.

payment of such taxes and penalty. If the purchaser of a business or stock of
goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as above provided and the taxes and
penalty shall remain unpaid after expiration of the thirty-day period allowed
for payment thereof, he shall be personally liable for the payment of all such
taxes and penalty, and the same shall be recoverable by the City Recorder as
provided by Section

defined, namely: Telephone service; electric service; gas service, including
bottled or liquid gas, if the seller thereof is classified as a public utility
subject to the jurisdiction of the state public Service Commission; water

753.02  IMPOSED; AMOUNT.
   There is hereby imposed and levied upon every purchaser of a public utility
service an excise tax upon the privilege of purchasing, using or consuming,
within the corporate limits of the City, such public utility service. Such tax
shall be in the amount of two percent of the charge, exclusive of any federal
or state tax thereon imposed upon the purchaser, made by the seller against the
purchaser with respect to each public utility service, which tax, in every
case, shall be collected by the seller and paid by the purchaser upon the
amount of each periodic statement rendered such purchaser by the seller, and
shall be paid by the purchaser to the seller at the time the purchase price or
such charge shall become due and payable under the agreement between the
purchaser and the seller. The tax imposed and levied by this article is in
addition to all other taxes imposed and levied by the City. In the event the
amount of the charge for any single public utility service exceeds the sum of
twenty thousand dollars in any given calendar month to any single purchaser, no
tax shall be imposed for such additional purchase, use or consumption in excess
of the amount of twenty thousand dollars. In the event more than one public
utility shall furnish the identical public utility service to the same
purchaser, the purchaser shall be entitled to group such services as a single
public utility service in calculating the amount of the charges in any calendar
month for such public utility service.
(11-19-73.)
753.03  COLLECTION; REPORTS.
   It shall be the duty of every seller, in acting as the tax-collecting medium
or agency for the City, to collect from each purchaser for the use of the City
the tax hereby imposed and levied at the time of collecting the purchase price
charged for its public utility service, and the amount of tax actually
collected during each calendar month shall be reported by each seller to the
City, and each seller shall remit the amount of tax shown by such report to
have been collected by the City on or before the last day of the second
calendar month following the month in which collected, as well as the name and

and levied. The required reports shall be in the form prescribed by the City
Recorder.
753.04  MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS.
   Every seller shall maintain complete records showing all purchases of public
utility service within the corporate limits of the City, which records shall
show the charge made against each purchaser, the dates such public utility
service was furnished, the date of payment therefor and the amount of tax
imposed hereunder, and such records shall be kept open for inspection by the
duly authorized agents of the City at reasonable times, and the duly authorized
agents of the City shall have the right, power and authority to make, at the
expense of the City, such transcripts thereof during such times as they may
desire.

   (a)   There shall be no liability upon the seller for erroneously collecting
the tax hereby imposed and levied or for erroneously failing to bill for such
tax as a result of good faith mistake on the part of the seller.  When any
purchaser contends that such tax is not owed by such purchaser on the grounds
that the public utility service was not purchased, used or consumed within the
corporate limits of the City, the seller shall refer the question to the City
Recorder, and such seller shall thereafter collect or refrain from collecting
such tax from such purchaser for such public utility service, as instructed, in
writing, by such City officer.  Any claim for refunds of any such tax shall be
presented to the City and not to the seller.
   (b)   The City Recorder shall have the authority to promulgate and enforce
reasonable rules and regulations necessary for the administration and
enforcement of this article.
753.07  ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS; PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any amount of tax due and unpaid under this chapter shall be a debt
due the City.  Such debt shall be a persona obligation of the purchaser, which

Virginia, or in any other manner provided by law for compelling the payment of
taxes due municipalities.

   (d)   “Hotel operator” means the person who is the proprietor of a hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,

shall be liable for the collection of the tax and for the tax.

consideration for the occupancy of the hotel room or rooms which is
extinguished only by payment of such tax to the operator. If, for any reason,
the tax due is not paid to the operator by the person paying the consideration
for the occupancy of the hotel room or rooms, the taxing authority may require
the tax to be paid directly by such person to the taxing authority of the City.

to be held in trust by the operator until the same have been remitted to the

subdivisions

hotel operator to collect the tax.
(12-4-00)
755.08  TOTAL AMOUNT COLLECTED TO BE REMITTED.
   No profit shall accrue to any person as a result of the collection of the
tax authorized under this article. Notwithstanding that the total amount of

percent for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all
taxes collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the taxing authority
as herein provided.
755.09  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any operator fails to make the return required by this article, or

received by the hotel operator or upon the expiration of the thirty day payment
period set forth in Section
755.09 of this article, whichever shall first occur.  The hotel operator shall
on or before the fifteenth day of each month, prepare and deliver to the taxing
authority a return for the preceding month, in the form prescribed by the

reasonable times.

actually participating in the management or operation of the association or

made by the convention and visitor’s bureau for the prior fiscal year. 
(12-4-00)
755.14  CESSATION OF BUSINESS.
   Whenever any operator required to collect and pay the taxing authority of
the city and tax collected pursuant to provisions of this article shall cease

and payable; and such operator shall immediately make a report and pay the tax
due the taxing authority of the City. 
(12-4-00)
755.15  ASSESSMENT OF TAX.
   If the taxing authority of the City believes that the tax imposed by this
article has been insufficiently returned by an operator, either because the
operator has failed or refused to properly collect or remit the tax, or has
failed to make a return, or has made a return which is incomplete, deficient or
otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to investigate and determine or estimate
the tax liability of the operator and make an assessment therefor.  Assessments
shall be served upon the taxpayer either personally or by certified mail. 
(12-4-00)
755.16  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT.
   The taxing authority of the City shall give the operator written notice of
any assessment made pursuant to this article.  Unless the operator to whom a
notice of assessment is given shall, within thirty days after service thereof,
either personally or by certified mail, file with the taxing authority of the
City a petition in writing, verified under oath by the operator or his duly
authorized agent having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with
particularity the items of the assessment objected to, together with the
reasons for the objections, the assessment shall become final and not subject
to administrative or judicial review.  The amount of an assessment shall be due
and payable on the day following the date upon which the assessment becomes
final.
(12-4-00)
755.17  HEARING PROCEDURE; ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.
   (a)   When a petition for reassessment provided for in Section
755.16 is filed within the time prescribed in such section for such filing, the
taxing authority of the City shall assign a time and place of a hearing hereon
and shall notify the operator of such hearing by written notice at least twenty
days in advance thereof.  Such hearing shall be held within ninety days from
the date of filing the petition unless continued by agreement of the parties or
by the taxing authority of the City for sufficient cause.
   (b)   The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial
manner by the taxing authority of the City or a hearing examiner designated by
the taxing authority of the City.  The burden of proof shall be upon the
operator to show that the assessment is incorrect and contrary to law, in whole
or in part.
   (c)   After such hearing, the taxing authority of the City shall, within a
reasonable time, give notice in writing of his decision. 
(12-4-00)
755.18  APPEALS.
   (a)   An appeal may be taken by the operator to the circuit court of Wetzel
County within thirty days after service of the taxing authority’s decision.
   (b)   The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the taxing
authority as an original notice.  When the petition and notice are so served,
they shall, with the return or acceptance, thereon, be filed in the office of
the clerk of the circuit court and docketed as other cases with the operator as
plaintiff and the City as defendant.  The filing of the appeal shall not stay
the collection of the tax.  The collection of the tax shall be stayed if the
plaintiff files with such clerk a bond, for the use of the defendant, with
sureties approved by the clerk, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the
total amount of the tax, interest and penalties, to such date, appealed from
and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the court;
provided, that a judge of the circuit court may stay the collection of the tax
without the requirement of a bond upon a proper showing by the operator that
the properties of the operator are sufficient to secure performance of the
court’s orders or that the ends of justice will be served thereby.
   (c)   The court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions
submitted to it on appeal from the determination of the taxing authority.  In
such appeal, a certified copy of the taxing authority’s assessment shall be
admissible and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the
provisions of this article.  The court shall render its decree thereon; and a
certified copy of the decree shall be filed by the Clerk of the Court with the
taxing authority, who shall then correct the assessment in accordance with such
decree.
   (d)   Unless an appeal is taken pursuant to this section within thirty days
after service of the administrative decision, the tax authority’s decision
shall become final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or judicial
review.  The amount, if any, due the City under such decision shall be due and
payable on the day following the date upon which such decision becomes final. 
(12-4-00)
755.19  TAX A DEBT DUE CITY.
   Any tax, penalties or interest due and payable under this article shall be a
debt due the City and shall be recoverable in an action brought in the name of
the City for the recovery of such tax, penalty or interest. 
(12-4-00)
755.20  INJUNCTION.
   If the failure of any operator to comply with the provisions of this article
continues for sixty days, the taxing authority of the City may proceed to
obtain an injunction restraining the operator from doing business in this City
until he fully complies with the provisions of this article.
(12-4-00)
755.21  RECORDS.
   The amount of tax, interest and penalties imposed by this article shall be
assessed within two years after the due date of the return; provided, that in
the case of a false or fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade the tax
or in case no return is filed, the assessment may be made at any time. 
(12-4-00)
755.22  REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under the provisions of this article, it may be refunded
as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, if a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the taxing authority of the City within two
years of the date of payment of such tax, interest or penalty.  Claims for
refunds shall be on forms prescribed by the tax authority.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established that the person from
whom the tax has been collected was not liable for the payment of such tax;
provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless
the amount of the tax so collected has been refunded to the person from whom
the tax was collected.
   (c)   A person paying the tax may obtain a refund of tax overpaid or paid
more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing a claim for refund but only when the tax was paid by such person
directly to the taxing authority or when such person, having paid the tax to
the operator, establishes that such person has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid unless the claimant establishes his right
thereto by written records evidencing his entitlement thereto. (12-4-00)
755.23  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   The administration of this article is vested in and shall be exercised by
the taxing authority of the City, who shall prescribe forms and reasonable
rules of procedure in conformity with this article for the making of returns
and for the ascertainment, assessment and collection of the tax imposed and
levied hereunder; and the enforcement of any of the provisions of this article
in any of the courts of the State shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of

   The following definitions shall be used in interpreting this article:
   (a)    “Users” of the municipal services including police protection, fire
protection, streets, street lighting, street cleaning, public parks and
recreational facilities mean, collectively, occupants, whether tenants or
owners, of all residential premises, which term includes houses, trailers and
apartments within the City.  The term “users” shall also include occupants,

premises, which shall include all businesses involving the sale of tangible

lighting, street cleaning, public parks and recreational facilities shall be
continued, maintained and improved by the City, in part, at the charge and
expense of the residents and owners of all premises of every kind and nature

lighting, street cleaning, public parks and recreational facilities. The
charges and expenses with respect to each of such users and beneficiaries shall

(2-26-07.)
757.03  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The imposition of municipal fees under this article is pursuant to
authorization set forth in West Virginia Code 8-13-13. In accordance with such
statute, it is the legislative intent of this article that the fees imposed
hereunder are based, in part, upon recognition of the following legislative
findings:
   (a)    Council finds that the City provides to individuals within its
borders certain municipal services including police and fire protection and
maintenance and improvements to streets, street lighting, street cleaning,
public parks and recreational facilities;
   (b)    Council finds that such services are within the authority and are the
responsibility of the municipal government of the City as provided under the
general laws of the state of West Virginia.
   (c)    Council finds that since such services are essential to the property
interest of residents to the city, it is therefore reasonable to derive a
portion of the cost of providing and maintaining such services from said
individuals.
   (d)    Council finds that WV Code 8-13-13 provides that every municipality
has the plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for the
installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such services, to make
reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance upon
the users of such services reasonable rates, fees and charges to be collected
in the manner proscribed by ordinance.
   (e)    Council finds that all of those individuals who use, enjoy and
benefit from these services should bear an equitable share of the costs
thereof.  Council acknowledges that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West
Virginia has recognized that no system of assessing the costs will be
absolutely perfect and that municipalities are only required to install a
reasonable system of distributing the costs to all of the users that it can
reach through reasonable and prudent means and legislation.
   (f)    Council finds that the imposition of the New Martinsville Municipal
Service Fee established herein is a reasonable system for distributing the
costs to all users that the city can reach through reasonable and prudent means
and legislation. (2-26-07.)
757.04  ASSESSMENT.
   For the continuance, maintenance and improvement of the special services
including police protection, fire protection streets, street lighting, street
cleaning, public parks and recreational facilities by the City, there is
imposed upon the users of all residential and commercial premises, as defined
hereinabove from and after May 1, 2007, an annual fee of ninety dollars which
shall be paid in monthly payments of seven dollars and fifty cents each month
thereafter so long as this article remains in effect. (2-26-07.)
757.05  ADMINISTRATION.
   This article shall be administered by the City Recorder. The City Recorder
is authorized to promulgate such regulations as are necessary and reasonable to
carry out the provisions of this article.
(2-26-07.)
757.06  LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
   A penalty often percent of the municipal fee then due shall be added for
failure to pay the monthly installments by the due date thereof.
(2-26-07.)
757.07  USE OF FUNDS.
   The revenues received from the collection of the fees herein for police
protection, fire protection, streets, street lighting, street cleaning, public
parks and recreational facilities shall be used only to defray the cost of the
continuance, maintenance or improvement of police protection, fire protection,
streets, street lighting, street cleaning, public parks and recreational
facilities within the City, and no part of such revenues shall be used for any
other municipal purpose. In the event the total revenues derived from this
article exceed the total expenditures of the police department, fire
department, street department and parks and recreation department for any
fiscal year, the City shall rebate the difference between the revenues derived
and expenditures to the owners who paid such fees on a pro-rata basis. Such
rebate may either be given by refund within ninety days at the end of the

Ordinance of the City of New Martinsville, West Virginia."

of the surface of any street, highway, sidewalk, alley, avenue or other public
way or public ground in the City.
905.03  PERMIT.
   (a)   Required.  It shall be unlawful for any person to dig up , break ,
excavate, tunnel, undermine or in any manner break up any street, to make or
cause to be made an excavation in or under the surface of any street for any
purpose or to place, deposit or leave upon any street any earth or other
excavated material obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the
street unless such person shall first have obtained an excavation permit
therefor from the City Recorder as herein provided. Applications and permits
will be on forms provided by the City.
   (b)   Application.  No excavation permit shall be issued unless a written
application for the issuance of an excavation permit is submitted to the
Recorder and Street Commissioner. The written application shall give the
location and dimension of the proposed opening, the purpose for which the
opening is made, the kind of pavement or surface to be opened and the
approximate time when the cut will be made. Permits will be issued only for
cuts to be made within one week of the date of issue. The period of time
allowed for closing the opening will be governed by its size and nature. It
will also be required that all applications for subsurface structures be
accompanied by a plan and typical cross section, which shall show as nearly as
possible from records available, the location of the existing underground
structures and the location of the proposed structure. No deviation from the
approved plan will be permitted until such deviation has been approved.
   (c)   Insurance and Bond Required.  A street opening permit will be issued
when the following provisions have been complied with:
      (1)   Satisfactory proof of public liability insurance, with fifty
thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars limits and property damage
insurance in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, to protect the
applicant and the City.
      (2)   A bond, in the amount of five thousand dollars, conditioned on the
faithful observance and compliance with all terms and conditions of the permit
and the payment of any and all claims and demands which might become due in
connection with any condition or activity relating to such permit.
      (3)   Exceptions to the requirements of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2)
hereof will be granted only when the requirements of a contract with the City
for other  work require street openings or street paving and in the case of
utilities whose franchise allows construction requiring street openings, unless
otherwise directed by the Street Commissioner.
   (d)   Denial.  Permits will be denied if:
      (1)   The City has any outstanding obligations against the permittee.
      (2)   Previous work has been declared unsatisfactory by the Street
Commissioner in a written report to Council and permittee, stating the reasons
therefor.
905.04  INTERFERENCE WITH VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.
   The permittee must carry on the work authorized by the permit in such a
manner as to cause a minimum of traffic flow interference. On main
thoroughfares and in the congested districts there must be, at all times,
sufficient traffic lanes open to permit a substantially normal flow of traffic.
Unless this can be accomplished, it will be necessary that the work be confined
to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. or between Midnight and 8:00 a.m.
and that temporary bridges be constructed across the opening to permit free
movement of both traffic and pedestrians.
905.05  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)    Trenching. The length, width and location of the trench , also the
manner in which the work is done, shall be under the control of the street
commissioner. Every precaution shall be taken to safeguard the work and to
inconvenience the public as little as possible.
      (1)   The permittee shall carefully remove the paving material and base
course in such a manner that adjacent base and paving is not damaged. Damaged
paving, base or both will be removed and replaced as required. Excavated
material shall be placed so as not to obstruct gutters or drains and in such
manner as will cause minimum inconvenience to the public. If necessary,
temporary covers for gutters shall be installed to insure adequate drainage. In
special cases it may be necessary to haul excavated material from the street.
      (2)   Trenches must be properly sheeted and braced, where necessary, to
prevent caving, slipping or cracking of sides. Sheeting and bracing used to
support the sides of the trench, shall be carefully removed as the backfilling
of the trench progresses, but if considered necessary by the Street
Commissioner for the protection of the banks , the sheeting and bracing shall
be left in the trench. Where, in excavating the trench or laying the pipe and
appurtenances, the pavement along the sides of the trench is, or becomes,
undermined and unsupported, the permittee shall, at his own cost and expense,
break down and remove such pavement and the foundation thereof, remove all
loose earth and replace with earth properly compacted in the manner provided in
subsection (c) of this section.
   (b)    Tunnelling. Tunnelling is often necessary where a pipe or conduit
passes under the curb, street, railway tracks or other conduits. The permittee,
however, shall not do any tunnelling except when required by or given
permission by the Street Commissioner. Where the tunnelling has been done, the
permittee shall bed the conduit being installed in fine material to a height of
one foot above top thereof. This fine material shall be wetted and tamped
under, around and over the pipe of conduit in the most thorough and careful
manner. The balance of the space from top of this filling to the roof of the
tunnel shall be completely filled with 1: 3: 5 concrete of suitable
consistency, thoroughly tamped to fill the entire space, and a rigid support
shall be afforded
for the tunnel roof for its entire area.
      (1)   In the installation of small service pipes, it is suggested that
the pipe be jacked through and under car tracks, curbs, etc. , or that a hole
be bored of sufficient size for the pipe.
      (2)   Whenever the trench crosses under any railroad, a permit from the
railroad must be obtained prior to application for the street opening permit.
      (3)   The permittee shall use all proper precautions to protect persons
from injury. Proper guards shall be placed along the line of the trench and red
lights placed to adequately protect traffic.
   (c)    Backfilling. It is very important that the street paving be restored
as quickly as is possible after the backfilling has been completed. It is,
therefor, essential that the backfilling be thoroughly compacted to prevent
subsequent settlement. Advance notice of the time when the backfilling is to be
done may be required, so as to permit the inspection of this work.
      (1)   After the pipes or other conduits have been laid, the bottom of the
trench shall be filled with fine selected material and tamped with proper tools
to insure the complete filling of the space at the bottom and sides of the
pipes or conduits.  The material used for filling to a height of not less than
six inches above the top of structure must be free from rock and must be
thoroughly tamped to prevent any settlement of the pipe. The trench shall then
be filled to the bottom of the paving base in six-inch layers thoroughly
compacted. Frozen earth or other material which cannot be properly compacted
shall not be used for backfilling under any circumstances. The permittee shall
remove from the site any excavated material unsuitable for backfilling and
replace with suitable material.  Temporary restoration will then be made as
provided in Section
905.06.
      (2)   If the trench is sheeted, the sheeting shall not be removed until
sufficient backfill has been placed to provide lateral support to prevent
caving of the trench. All voids left by the removal of sheeting must be
thoroughly filled  with suitable material. If it is necessary to leave the
sheeting in the trench, it must be allowed to extend above the subgrade of the
proposed restoration.
905.06  RESTORATION.
   (a)   Temporary.  If a complete restoration is not to be made immediately,
the permittee is required to make and maintain the temporary restoration safe
and satisfactory for travel until the permanent restoration is made.  On
certain streets, the city may require a temporary surface of bituminous
concrete.
   (b)   Unimproved Surfaces.  After the backfilling has been compacted to a
point six inches below finished grade, the trench shall be completely filled
with W.V. No. 1 slag, carefully leveled off, compacted and choked with fine
material. Where the trench is in sodded areas, it shall be carefully compacted.
Damaged or destroyed sod shall be replaced and the entire area shall be
carefully cleaned up and left in neat condition.
   (c)   Base. 
      (1)   Openings made in bituminous treated or bituminous concrete surfaces
with no concrete base shall be replaced with six inches of 1:2:3 concrete
extending nine inches beyond the trench and shall be finished two inches below
the surface.
      (2)   When openings are made in or partly in the berm of any roadway, the
base shall be a minimum of six inches of W. Va. No. 1 slag, compacted and
choked in an acceptable manner.
      (3)   When openings are made in concrete base, the old base shall be cut
back nine inches on each side of the trench, the edges cut in a reasonably
straight line and nine inches of 1:2:3 concrete reinforced with forty-two-pound
mesh placed and finished to the proper grade depth to receive the type of
surface to be placed thereon. The street commissioner may require that quick
setting cement be used if it is necessary to open the base to travel in less
than twenty-four hours.
   (d)   Bituminous Concrete Paving.
      (1)   Any bituminous surface, whether surface-treated or bituminous
concrete, shall be surfaced with bituminous concrete to the same depth as the
surface material surrounding the opening, but not less than two inches. Before
the new material is placed, the edges shall be cut back twelve inches from the
edges of the trench or three inches more than the base was cut back and all
edges shall be thoroughly painted with bitumen equal to that used in the
wearing  coat.
      (2)   If work is done when hot mixed bituminous concrete is not
available, then cold mix shall be used and when hot mix is available the cold
mix will then be removed and replaced with hot mix. If this is not done, then
the city will surface treat the area involved and charge the permittee at the
rate of three dollars per square yard.
      (3)   All material and workmanship shall conform to standard
specifications of the state road commission for bituminous concrete paving.
Bituminous concrete must be compacted in layers not to exceed two inches in
thickness.
   (e)   Brick Pavement. All broken or damaged bricks are to be discarded and
replaced by brick equal to the brick in the existing pavement. The repaving
shall correspond as nearly as possible with requirements for standard brick
paving. Sand-cement shall be used for the paving bed and the joints filled with
asphalt filler and covered with sand. In the case of old brick pavements where
City maintenance consists of coating with bituminous material, the restoration
of the paving cut by the permittee shall consist in installing the concrete
foundation and bringing the same to a level two inches below the top of the
adjoining pavement and placing bituminous concrete which must be well-jointed
to the adjacent pavement by painting with hot or cold bitumen equal to that
used in the wearing coat. Rolling will be required for all longitudinal cuts.
   (f)   Concrete Pavement.
      (1)   In the restoration of cuts in concrete pavements, the following
specifications shall be observed: The thickness of the new concrete pavement
shall at no time be less than six inches. The edges of the trench shall be cut
back in a manner similar to that described for concrete base. The cut shall be
squared by straight lines enclosing the cut. The old reinforcement shall be
straightened out into the new pavement and the deficiency supplied by a strip
of new forty-two pounds per one thousand feet mesh lapping back on the old
reinforcement.
      (2)   The concrete mixture shall be 1: 2: 3 and shall be mixed with the
least possible amount of water.  Prior to the placing of any concrete, the
sides of the existing concrete pavement shall be thoroughly washed with clean
water and then painted with a cement paste, while the sub grade shall be
dampened. The concrete shall be placed in four-inch layers, each layer
thoroughly tamped. The edges of the new pavement shall be thoroughly troweled
to minimize the checking of the edges. Finishing shall be by a wood float
followed by brushing. Curing shall be done in accordance with instructions of
the street commissioner. The area shall be blocked against traffic for such a
period of time as may be necessary to prevent injury to the new work. This
period of time will be determined by the street commissioner.
      (3)   If, in the opinion of the Street Commissioner, it is inadvisable to
block the pavement area for the length of time required for the setting of
normal concrete, the permittee shall be required to use an approved brand of
quick setting cement.
   (g)   Cement Walks.  In the restoration of cement walks, in addition to the
question of serviceability and durability of restoration, the matter of
appearance will be considered in determining the area to be restored regardless
of the size of the cut. In general, it will be the policy to require the
restoration of a complete block if more than half the area of the original
block is destroyed incident to making the opening. The Street Commissioner is
authorized to require restoration of full blocks if, in his opinion, the
circumstances justify such action.
      (1)   In restoration of cuts in cement walks, they shall be neatly
squared out by a series of straight lines at least four inches back from the
lines of the trench. The new work shall be joined up with the old cement work
in a neat and workmanlike manner. Finishing shall be done by a wood float only.
      (2)   If the area of restoration of walk is materially less than total
frontage, an effort should be made to match as nearly as possible the
appearance of the balance of the walk in the frontage.
   (h)   Brick Walks.  Brick walks shall be restored in manner to produce a
pavement equal in every respect to the adjoining walk not disturbed. A
foundation of not less than four inches of cinders or gravel shall be provided
and thoroughly tamped. The bricks shall be laid on and the joints filled with
fine dry sand. All defective bricks shall be replaced by new or used whole
brick, of quality equal to those in the old walk. If more than half the
pavement area is disturbed, the Street Commissioner may require restoration of
the entire pavement area as provided for cement walks.
   (i)   Test Borings.  Test borings less than three inches in diameter will be
filled to within one inch of the top with dry sand. Crack filler heated to the
proper temperature will then be poured level with the surface and covered with
dry sand. Any excess material on the street will be carefully cleaned up.
   (j)   Sod Areas in Sidewalks or Street Shoulders.  For this type of cut
every effort must be made to replace not only the actual disturbed area, but
any adjacent area which may have been injured or destroyed by the permittee's
work. If the existing sod can be removed and is not injured thereby, it must be
replaced, but any damaged sod must be replaced by new sod.  Restoration will
not be considered complete until restored sod shall have been knitted with the
subgrade and any new maintenance necessary (such as watering) shall be
considered a part of the restoration.
905.07  LIABILITY FOR DEFECTIVE BACKFILLING.
   Any settlement of the trench or its wearing surface during a period of two
years after the permanent restoration shall be considered conclusive evidence
of defective backfilling by the permittee, and the permittee agrees, in
accepting and acting under the permit, that he will make good any such
settlement and replace the wearing surface during the period of two years after
the
completion of the trench restoration.
905.08  CHARGES FOR RESTORATION WORK BY CITY.
   Any restoration service performed by the City will be force account plus
cost. This cost will be computed as follows: The sum of field labor,
supervision, material used in restoration, plus twenty percent and charge for
use of equipment at regular scheduled rates.
 
Inspection Fees

A74-42 or equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification C13-44T or
equal; or other suitable material approved by the Superintendent. Joints shall
be gastight and watertight, and verified by proper testing. Any part of the
building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be
constructed of cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints. Cast iron pipe with
leaded joints may be required by the Superintendent where the building sewer is
exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the
building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe; except, that nonmetallic
material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as
approved by the director.
   (g)   Size and Slope.  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be
subject to the approval of  the Superintendent, but in no event shall the
diameter thereof be less than four inches. The slope of such four inch pipe
shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot.
   (h)   Depth, Grade and Alignment.  Whenever possible, the building sewer
shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No
building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing
wall which wall might thereby be weakened. The depth of the building sewer
shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. Insofar as is possible,
the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in  straight alignment.
Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings.
   (i)   Buildings Where Drain Too Low to Permit Gravity Flow.  In all
buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the
public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by
means approved by the Superintendent and discharged to the building sewer.
   (j)   Excavations.
      (1)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification

shall be made with approved hot-poured jointing material or cement mortar as
specified below.
      (4)   Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of one
hundred sixty degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried
by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp
or similar approved material.
      (5)   Cement joints shall be made by packing a closely twisted jute or
oakum gasket, of suitable size to fill partly the annular space between the
pipes. The remaining space shall be filled and firmly compacted with mortar
composed of one part portland cement and three parts mortar sand. The material
shall be mixed dry and only sufficient water shall be added to make the mixture
workable.  Mortar which has begun to set shall not be used or retempered. Lime
putty or hydrated lime may be substituted to the extent of not more than
twenty-five percent of the volume of the portland cement that may be added.
      (6)   Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval
of the Superintendent.
   (l)   Method of Connecting.   The connection of the building sewer into the
public sewer shall be made by the “Y" branch, if such branch is available at a
suitable location. If the public sewer is twelve inches in diameter or less and
no properly located “Y" branch is available, the owner shall, at his expense,
install a "Y” branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the
Superintendent. When the public sewer is greater than twelve inches in diameter
and no properly located “Y” branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into
the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream
direction at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees. A forty-five degree
all may be used to make such connection, with the spigot and cut so as not to
extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building
sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or a higher elevation
than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and
the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special
fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the
Superintendent.
   (m)   Notification of Superintendent.  The applicant for the building sewer
permit shall notify the Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for
inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made
under the supervision of the Superintendent or his representative.

treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, and, will not otherwise endanger life, limb, public property
or constitute a nuisance. The Board may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the standards below if, in its opinion, such reduced
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming its opinion
as to acceptability, the Board will give consideration to such factors as the
quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment plant and
other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer which
shall not be violated, without approval of the Board, are as follows:

SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN CASES WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE IS CONNECTED TO
THE CITY’S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
   Wherever the City has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, downspout,
storm sewer, or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the City’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the City,
in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission,
to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
 
S       =   A x R x .0006233 x C
S       =   The surcharge in dollars
A       =   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection surface
connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet
R       =   The measured monthly rainfall, in inches
.0006233    =   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of surface
to thousands of gallons of water
C       =   The City’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage.
   The City shall not impose the surcharge unless, and until, the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery,
that is has been established by smoke testing, dye testing or on-site
inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water
from the sanitary sewer system.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist.  Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
   (e)   Schedule III.
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN THE CASE OF USERS PRODUCING UNUSUAL WASTE
   The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
Ci    =    VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
Ci    =   charge to unusual users per year
Vo    =   average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in
dollars per gallon
Vi    =   volume of wastewater from unusual users in gallons per year
Bo    =   average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen Demand
(BOD) in dollars per pound
Bi    =    weight of BOD from unusual users in pounds per year
So    =   average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment) chargeable to
total solids in dollars per pound
Si    =    weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made.  Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the City, should not be introduced into the
sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results of this preliminary study
will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service and the
charge therefore, based upon the formula set out above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit
of the City records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the above
formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be paid by
the unusual user.  Based on these audited figures, additional billings covering
the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or refund
given by the City of New Martinsville, as the case may be.  Such audited
figures will then be used for the preliminary billing for the next fiscal year,
at the end of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.
   Comment - Not part of the rate schedule.
         This schedule is included on an if-and-when basis.
   (f)   Schedule IV.
APPLICABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF CITY OF NEW

period including time-of-day billing periods, the reading of the meter
measuring the flow of energy from the Customer-generator to the City shall be
subtracted from the reading of the meter measuring the flow of energy from the
City to the Customer- generator to obtain a measurement of net kW hours for
billing purposes.
   MONTHLY CHARGES
Monthly charges shall be calculated using an identical rate structure to the
structure that would apply to the customer if it were not a Customer-generator.
Measurement and Charges.  The measurement of net electrical energy supplied or
generated will be calculated as follows:
      1.   The net electrical energy produced or consumed during the billing
period shall be measured in accordance with normal metering practices.
      2.   The City shall credit a Customer-generator for each kW hour produced
by an alternative or renewable energy resource installed on the Customer-
generator side of the electric meter and delivered to the utility’s electric
distribution system through the Customer-generator’s electric revenue meter, up
to the total amount of electricity delivered by the utility to that customer
during the billing period.
      3.   If a Customer-generator supplies more electricity to the electric
distribution system than the City delivers to the Customer-generator in a given
billing period, the excess kW hours shall be carried forward and credited
against the Customer-generator usage in subsequent billing periods at the full
retail rate.  Provided that, if a Customer-generator terminates service with
the electric utility, the utility is not required to provide compensation to
the Customer-generator for any outstanding kW hour credits.
      4.   Rate credits shall not be applied to reduce any fixed monthly
minimum bill, customer charge, demand charges or other charges not related to
energy consumption.
   EQUIPMENT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Data for all major equipment proposed by the Customer to satisfy the Technical
Requirements must be submitted for review and approval by the City with a
completed interconnection application.  To facilitate review and approval, the
City will maintain a list of Pre-certified equipment.
The City List of Pre-certified equipment is available upon request and contains
Pre- certified equipment types, makes and models of manufactured generating
equipment and interconnection system components.  This listing is based upon
equipment certified by recognized national testing laboratories as suitable for
interconnection with a distribution system based upon compliance with IEEE
1547.
The use of equipment that is not pre-certified may delay the City review and
approval of the customer’s design.  All interconnection equipment must be
approved by the City prior to being connected to the City distribution system
and before parallel operation is allowed.
The interconnection system hardware and software design requirements in the
Technical Requirements are intended to assure protection of the City’s
distribution system.
   (g)   Power Cost Adjustment “PCA”.
APPLICABILITY
Applicable to all customers receiving service under Schedule RS, Schedule SCS
or Schedule LPS.
   CALCULATION OF MONTHLY FACTOR
The Schedules subject to this rider recover $0.09226 per kWh sold of purchased
power cost.  The City will track the monthly cost of purchased power and the
total kWh sales to determine the amount of over or under recovery from the base
rates.  Power cost includes, but not limited to, all charges from the all-
requirements contract with American Municipal Power-Ohio and any other charges
passed through from the PJM Interconnection.
The City will review the over/under collection of power costs periodically and,
if necessary, bill a Power Cost Adjustment factor, either positive or negative,
to retail customer bills to make up for the over or under recovery of power
cost.  The power cost adjustment and charge applied to kWh sales will be shown
as a separate item on the customer bill.
      (5-7-18.)
   (h)   Review of Rates by Council.  Council may, at any time, and shall, no
later than the first day of March of each year, cause a review to be made of
the rate schedules hereinabove made and established for the purpose of
determining what modifications, additions, etc., if any, shall be established
with respect to such rate schedules.

of a guaranty agreement shall not apply to commercial nor industrial customers.
         B.   Guaranty agreements shall terminate after the customer has
satisfactorily paid bills for service for twelve consecutive months, or when
the customer gives notice to the City of the discontinuance of service where no
notice was given or at the guarantor’s request upon thirty (30) days written
notice to the City.  In any case, after the automatic termination of a security

expense, all wiring location on the customer’s side of the electric service. 
All such wiring shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the
National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Safety Code and any other
National, State or local codes of any authority having jurisdiction.  The
customer shall bring his wiring outside of the service weather head a minimum
of eighteen (18) inches and in such a manner that it is easily accessible to
the City’s line.  A readily accessible, and approved and properly sized (as per
NEC requirements), main disconnect panel shall be located inside the building
and prior to the connection of any electrical loads.
      (4)   When a service connection other than overhead service drop is
required, the applicant for service shall be responsible for the additional
cost attributed to such facilities or as otherwise provided by any applicable
regulatory rules of the state.
   (f)   Meter Connection. 
      (1)   The customer shall provide, free of expense to the City, a suitable
place for the electric service meter or other equipment or devices of the
City.  The City will furnish and connect the necessary metering apparatus for

shall be convenient for the reading, inspection and testing of the meter by the
City.
      (2)   Prior to the connection of service by the City, the customer shall
furnish and install, and shall thereafter maintain at all times, a ground
connection in compliance with the requirements of the National Electrical Code,
as the same may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Unless provided otherwise, by contract, the point at which the
customer’s installation is connected to that of the City shall be known as the

of entire removal of its property in the event of the termination of the
contract for any cause.
      (2)   The City shall in no way be responsible for damages arising from an
error or defect in the wiring of the customer.  All wiring is to be in
accordance with regulations of the National Electrical Code, the National
Safety Code or any other authority having jurisdiction.
      (3)   The customer is to install only such motors or other apparatus or
appliances as are suitable for operation with the specific character of
services supplied by the City, and which will not be detrimental to the same. 
The electric service is not to be used in such a manner as to cause unprovided
for voltage fluctuations or disturbances in the City’s distribution system. 
The City will be the judge as to the suitability of apparatus or appliances to
be connected to lines, and as to whether the operation of such apparatus or
appliances will be detrimental to its general service, subject to determination
by the state public service commission in case of controversy.
      (4)   The customer shall not interfere with or allow others to interfere
with the meter or meters or outside wiring of the City.  All complaints
concerning the service and the meter shall be made directly to the City’s
business office at City Hall.
      (5)   The customer shall not make any material additions to his
installation which cause the power requirement to exceed the service capacity
for which the customer has contract without the prior written consent of the
City.  If the City consents to any such increase, such service capacity shall
be increased to an amount equal to the increased power requirements to which
the City so consented.  Should the customer increase his power requirements
above the amount of the power requirement contracted for or the amount of the
power requirement consented to by the City, the customer shall be responsible
for, and indemnify the City against, any losses, damages or injuries sustained
by the City or otherwise resulting therefrom, and all claims therefor.
      (6)   If a customer makes a reduction from his connected load, he must
notify the City in writing; otherwise, no credit will be allowed.  Any changes

reading for billing purposes, and such billing is to be based on such revised
connected load or capacity as may be determined by the City’s inspector.
      (7)   The customer’s contract for electric service is not transferable
without the written consent of the City.
      (8)   The customer shall give the City three days’ written notice, unless
otherwise provided for, in advance of intended discontinuance of service and/or
removal from the premises, and in the event of failure to do so will be liable
for payment of all service rendered up to the time the company receives notice
of the customer’s discontinuance of service.
      (9)   It is expressly understood and agreed that the electric service to
be delivered by the City to the customer is not to be resold for any purpose.
   (h)   Billing and Payments.
      (1)   Bills for service will be rendered by the City to the customer in
accordance with the rate applicable to the service of the customer.  All bills
for lighting and power will be considered in arrears and overdue twenty days
after their due date.  Customers not receiving their monthly bill at the usual
time should make inquiries of the City in order to preserve their rights tot he
amount of the bill.  Failure to receive the bill will not entitle the customer
to an extension of the twenty days allowed by the City for the payment of the
net amount of the bill from the date on which it is due.  All bills are payable
at the City’s office.
      (2)   When payment of a bill is sent by United States mail, the date of
payment will be established from the postmark if such a postmark is legible. 
In the absence of such a postmark, a bill will be considered paid on the date a
bill is received by the City.
      (3)   In the event of the stoppage of or failure by any meter to register
the full amount of current consumed, the customer will be billed for such
period on an estimated consumption based on the customer’s use of current in a
similar period of like use.
      (4)   If inclement weather or any other cause prevents the reading of a
customer’s meter by the City, the City shall have the right to estimate a
customer’s bill and to make any necessary billing adjustments, without
interest, on a subsequent bill based on a reading of such meter.
   (i)   Failure to Pay.  If a customer shall fail to make payment for any
service rendered by the City after payment is due, the City shall have the
right to either cancel the service contract, in which event the minimum
payments as provided in the schedule for the unexpired term of the contract
shall thereupon become payable to the City as liquidated damages, or, at the
City’s option, to discontinue service until all payment due to the City form
the customer have been made.
   (j)   Emergencies.  The City will endeavor to furnish a regular and
continuous electric service, but makes no guarantees to the effect.  The City
shall not be liable for damages in the event the supply of electricity is
interrupted or should failure of electric services occur due to any acts of
God, public enemies, accident, shortages of energy supply, labor disputes,
riots, wars, orders or acts of civil or military authority, breakdowns or
injury to equipment, transmission distribution or other facilities of the City,
extraordinary repairs or any decision of the City to interrupt service so as to
prevent or limit any instability or disturbance on the electric system of the
City or any electric system interconnected with it.
   (k)   Interruption and Discontinuance of Service.  The City reserves the
right to discontinue the supply of electrical energy and/or disconnect its
lines and remove its property from the customer’s premises for any of the
following reasons: The purpose of making repairs; nonpayment of bills when due;
the customer’s use of electrical energy supplied to him by the City is
detrimental to the City’s supply of energy in general or in the customer’s
locality; for fraudulent use of electricity; and whenever such action is
necessary to protect the City from fraud, theft or abuse.
   (l)   Utility Discontinuance of Service.  The City may, after giving written
notice and attempting personal contact as provided below, discontinue service
to any customer for non-payment of bills where any bill is ten (10) or more

customer shall be at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled
service termination unless it is reasonably established that the premises are
not permanently inhabited.  The written notice shall become void if the City
has not discontinued service within thirty (30) days of the date indicated on
the notice for termination.  The personal notice shall become void if the City
has not discontinued service within thirty (30) days of the personal notice. 
The individual giving notice in person shall present a copy of the original
written notice or a document which contains the same information as presented
on the original notice.  If the personal notice is by telephone, the person
shall inform the customer how to obtain a copy of the original written notice.
      (2)   If, prior to termination of service, the City receives notice from
the customer (1) that any portion of the bill is in dispute, (2) that he or she
is being charged for service not rendered, (3) that any information resulting

City shall provide an opportunity to the customer for presentation of his or
her complaint to a designated managerial employee, who is empowered to resolve
the dispute.  The hearing shall take place at the business office nearest to
the customer’s residence: Provided, however, that at the option of the
customer, the hearing may take place by telephone conference.  The customer
shall have seven (7) days from the date of the City’s decision to file an
appeal with the Public Service Commission.  Service may not be terminated from
the date the City receives notice of the customer complaint until the
expiration of the seven (7) day appeal period, or during the pendency of an
appeal to the Public Service Commission.  Any amount not in dispute must be
paid by the customer in order to protect his or her rights under this rule as
provided in subsection (l)(3) hereof.
      (3)   A residential customer who has been notified that electric service
is to be terminated for non-payment of bills shall be given the opportunity to
enter into a deferred payment agreement, provided that the customer has

including, but not limited to the following: amount of the bill; ability of the
customer to pay; payment history; time the debt has been outstanding; reasons
why the debt has been outstanding; and any other relevant factors.
         B.   The City may collect a carrying charge of 6% on any outstanding
balance subject to a deferred payment agreement;
         C.   The deferred payment agreement shall include language informing
the customer of the right to appeal the reasonableness of the proposed payments

his rights under this rule.
         E.   If the deferred payments are not received by the City in
accordance with the terms of the agreement, the City may terminate service
after it has mailed written notice, by first class mail to the customer at
least five (5) calendar days, excluding postal holidays, prior to termination,
provided, that at the option of the City, either personal contact or telephone
contact may be substituted for contact by first class mail.  If the customer
makes the delinquent payment within that notice period, service shall not be
terminated.

request, then a charge equal to the sum of the minimum monthly bills determined
for the months or parts thereof that service was disconnected, will be charged
to the customer and must be paid, in addition to the charges stated in
foregoing subsection (m) hereof before reconnection is made.  The provisions
hereof shall not apply in any instance where the service location is classified
as residential rental property, or is owned by the City or any of its
divisions, boards or commissions, and is operated in furtherance of
governmental services.

energy received to the voltage suitable for their use.  The design and
construction of the substation shall include such protective and switching
equipment as may, in the opinion of the City, be necessary to avoid
interference with the service supplied from its distribution lines.
   (r)   Promises.  No statement or representation of any employee or officer
of the City shall bind the City, unless the same is in writing and approved by
the signature of the superintendent of the utility department or a duly
authorized officer of the department.  No employee or officer of the City or
its utility department is authorized to waive this condition.  (9-7-04)

1313.04   Minimum right-of-way widths.
1313.05   Minimum pavement widths.
1313.06   Street grades, curves and sight distances.
1313.07   Intersections.
1313.08   Lots.
 
1313.01  COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE.
   In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the general
principles and requirements as set out in this article. 
(11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.02  OFFICIAL THOROUGHFARE PLAN.
   (a)   The subdivision layout shall conform to the Official Thoroughfare
Plan.
      (1)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway,
thoroughfare or parkway, so designated on such plan, such part of such public
way shall be platted by the subidivder in the location and at the width
indicated on the plan.
      (2)   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site or
other public ground shown in the adopted City plan is located, in whole or in
part, within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or park, if
not dedicated to the City or Board of Education, shall be reserved for
acquisition by the City or Board of Education within a period of five years by
purchase or other means.  In the event that such land remains entirely unused
and vacant during such five year period, the City Council will exempt it from
all ad valorem taxes assessable by the City.
   (b)   Where held appropriate by the Planning Commission, open spaces,
constituting a reasonable proportion of the gross acreage of the subdivision,
suitably located and of adequate size for parks, playgrounds or other
recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use, shall be provided for in
the proposed subdivision and, if not dedicated to the City or County, as the
case may be, shall be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the
proposed subdivision by covenant or deed restriction. 
(11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.03  STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (a)   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood.
      (1)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
      (2)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Commission, such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.  Dead-end streets of reasonable length (normally not over six
hundred feet) will be approved where necessitated by topography or where, in
the opinion of the Commission, they are appropriate for the type of development
contemplated.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
      (4)   Where there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided a
dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half-
width of such street or alley shall be platted.
      (5)   Alleys shall be platted in all business districts.  To provide safe
access to residential lots fronting on thoroughfares, major streets and
parkways, alleys shall be platted in the rear of such lots or service drives
provided in front thereof.  Alleys will not be approved in other locations in
residence districts, unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional
conditions.
      (6)   Lands abutting highways or principal thoroughfares should be
platted with the view of making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for
such use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways, and
with the view of minimizing interference with traffic on such trafficways as
well as the accident hazard.  This may be accomplished in several ways, as
follows:
         A.   By platting the lots abutting such trafficways at very generous
depth, and by providing vehicular access to them by means of either alleys or
service drives in the rear, or frontage access roads next to the highway,
connected therewith at infrequent intervals.
         B.   Another more desirable and usually more economical method consist
of not fronting the lots on the highway but on a minor street paralleling the
highway at a distance of a generous lot depth.  Private driveways in this case
would, of course, connect with such minor street.
         C.   Under still another scheme, a collector street may be platted
more or less parallel with the highway, six hundred feet to one thousand feet
distant therefrom, from which loop streets or dead-end streets would extend
toward the highway, the ends of which give access to the lots abutting the
highway to their rear.
   Selection, in a specific case, among the foregoing or other methods for
accomplishing the purposes in view must necessarily be made in consideration of
topography and other physical conditions, the character of existing and
contemplated developments and other pertinent factors that apply in each case.
      (7)   Subdivisions abutting a stream or lake shall provide roads
providing access to the low water mark, so that there will be roads at one-half
mile intervals as measured along the stream or lake shore.
   (b)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers or lots of
appropriate depth.
      (1)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as, in the opinion of the
Commission, are appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but shall not exceed eighteen hundred feet where the average size
of lots does not exceed two acres in area.
      (2)   In any block over nine hundred feet in length, the Commission may
require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than ten feet wide, be
provided near the center and entirely across such block.
      (3)   The number of intersecting streets along highways, thoroughfares
and parkways shall be held to a minimum.  Wherever practicable, blocks along
such trafficways shall not be less than twelve hundred feet in length.
         (11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.04  MINIMUM RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS.
   (a)   The minimum right-of-way widths for highways, primary thoroughfares
and parkways shall be as specified in the official thoroughfare plan, but not
less than sixty feet in any case.
   (b)   The minimum right-of-way widths for secondary thoroughfares shall be
as specified in the official thoroughfare plan, but not less than fifty feet in
any case.
   (c)   The minimum right-of-way width for local streets or collector streets
shall be forty feet.
   (d)   The minimum right-of-way width for minor streets and dead-end streets
shall be forty feet.  All dead-end streets shall terminate in a circular
turnaround having a minimum right- of-way diameter of one hundred feet, unless
the Commission approves a “T” or “Y” shaped paved space in place of the
required turning circle.
   (e)   Where easements are required for utilities, their width shall be at
least ten feet along rear or side lot lines.
(11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.05  MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTHS.
   Minimum pavement widths, face to face of curb, required to be installed at
the subdivider’s expense, shall be as follows:
   (a)   Primary and secondary thoroughfares and parkways, thirty feet; local
streets or collector streets, twenty-four feet; minor and dead-end streets,
twenty feet.
In the case of a primary or secondary thoroughfare or parkway and in the case
of a local street or collector street, usually requiring pavements wider than
twenty- four feet, the matter of financial and other arrangements for
installing such wider pavements at the time the subdivider will make the
improvement shall be taken up with the subdivider by the officials having
jurisdiction.
   (b)   The pavement of a turning circle at the end of a dead-end street shall
have a minimum outside diameter of sixty feet.  A “T” or “Y” shaped paved
space, when approved by the Commission in place of a turning circle, shall
extend entirely across the width of the street right-of-way, except for
sidewalk space, and shall be at least sixteen feet wide with the flared portion
rounded by minimum radii of twenty feet.
   (c)   Alleys and service drives, eighteen feet. 
(11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.06  STREET GRADES, CURVES AND SIGHT DISTANCES.
   (a)   The grades of streets shall not exceed the following; except, that
where unusual or exceptional conditions exist, the Commission may modify these
regulations:
      (1)   Highways and primary thoroughfares, four percent.
      (2)   Secondary thoroughfares and parkways, ten percent; local streets,
minor streets, service drives and alleys, fifteen percent.
      (3)   Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, twenty percent, unless steps of an
acceptable design are to be constructed.
   (b)   All changes in street grades in excess of one percent shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equal to fifteen times the
algebraic difference in the rate of grade for highways, thoroughfares and
parkways, and one-half of this minimum for all other streets.
   (c)   The radii of curvature on the centerline shall not be less than the
following:
      (1)   Highways, thoroughfares and parkways, four hundred feet.
      (2)   Local streets, minor streets and service drives, one hundred feet.
         (11-4-85, appx. II.)
1313.07  INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   At street and alley intersections, property line corners shall be
rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be ten and five feet,
respectively.  In business districts, a chord may be substituted for such arc.
   (b)   Street curb intersections may be rounded by radii of at least twenty
feet.
   (c)   The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle of
intersection is less than sixty degrees.
(11-4-85, appx.II.)
1313.08  LOTS.
   (a)   The size, shape and orientation of the lots shall be appropriate for
the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated; provided, that no lot shall contain less than seven thousand two
hundred square feet in area.
   (b)   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided.  (A proportion
of 2 to 1 shall normally be considered as appropriate, except in the case of
narrow lots.)
   (c)   Every lot shall abut on a street.
   (d)   Lots for residence purposes shall be at least sixty feet wide at the
building setback lines, in order to permit compliance with the side yard
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and still be adequate for a building of
practicable width.
   (e)   Double-frontage lots and reversed-frontage lots shall be avoided.
   (f)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-
way line of the street on which the lot faces.
   (g)   Corner lots for residential use shall be platted wider than interior
lots in order to permit conformance with the front yard setback on the side
street required.
   (h)   Residential lots fronting or abutting on highways, thoroughfares and
other important trafficways should have extra depth to permit deep setbacks for
the buildings from such trafficways.

Modifications and Exceptions
1317.01   Generally.
1317.02   Exemption of small subdivisions.
1317.03   Subdivisions involving five parcels or less along existing streets.
1317.04   Modifications to avoid undue hardship.
 
1317.01  GENERALLY.
   The general principles of design and the minimum requirements for the laying
out of subdivisions, stipulated in Article
1313, may be varied by the Commission in the case of a subdivision large enough
to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood, to be developed in
accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by appropriate restrictions,
which, in the judgment of the Commission, make adequate provision for all
essential community requirements; provided, that no modification shall be made
by the Commission which would conflict with the proposals of the official
thoroughfare plan, with the official plan for schools, parks and other open
public grounds, with other features of the City Plan or with the intent and
purpose of such general principles of design and minimum requirements. 
(11-4-85, § 7.)
1317.02  EXEMPTION OF SMALL SUBDIVISIONS.
   In the case of a small subdivision of minor importance situated in a
locality where conditions are well defined, the Commission may exempt the
subdivider from complying with some of the requirements stipulated in Section
1301.07 pertaining to the preparation of the preliminary plat. 
(11-4-85, §7.)
1317.03  SUBDIVISIONS INVOLVING FIVE PARCELS OR LESS ALONG EXISTING STREETS.
   A proposed division of a parcel of land along an existing public street, not
involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, and
involving no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely
subdivided, may be submitted to the Commission for approval, and if the
Commission, acting through the City Engineer and/or Department Head, is
satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to applicable platting,
subdividing or zoning regulations, it shall, within thirty working days after
submission, approve such proposed division and, on presentation of a conveyance
of such parcel, shall stamp the same “Approved by the City Planning Commission,
New Martinsville, West Virginia,” and have it signed by its clerk, secretary or
other official as may be designated by it.  In so doing, the Commission may
require the submission of a sketch and such other information as is pertinent
to its determination hereunder. 
(11-4-85, § 7.)
1317.04  MODIFICATIONS TO AVOID UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   In any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by reason of
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with
any requirement of this chapter would cause practical difficulty or exceptional
and undue hardship, the Commission may relax such requirement to the extent
deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided,
that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good and
without impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter or the desirable
general development of the neighborhood and the community in accordance with
the City Plan and the Zoning Ordinance.  Any modifications thus granted shall
be entered in the minutes of the commission, setting forth the reasons which,
in the opinion of the commission, justified the modifications.

permits for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (33)   State Coordinating Office. The West Virginia Division of Homeland

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (36)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (37)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the Start of Construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (38)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (39)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this Ordinance. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(Passed 9-24-09.)
1711.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the City of
New Martinsville which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of New Martinsville by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated September 25th, 2009 or the most
recent revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the
City of New Martinsville which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
the City of New Martinsville by use of historic or other technical data and
shown on the City of New Martinsville "Local Flood Hazards Map". These areas
shall be designated as appropriate with the level of technical data described
below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas.  The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (b)(4) hereof.
In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated, the
regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating
significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the community, be
considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from the top of
the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100 year floodplain
boundary.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM or floodway map included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the floodplain
administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the City of New Martinsville where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the community shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of New Martinsville may identify and regulate new flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived
technical information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1711.06.  Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to
apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood
Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of New
Martinsville appeals board which shall consist of
members of the Common Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/
applicant.
(Passed 9-24-09.)
1711.04  UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood
Elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development may not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant has the burden to demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the
minimum necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4), any
development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)   AE Area Without Floodway (F3).  Within any AE area without floodway,
no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of
the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the City of New Martinsville Floodplain Administrator, The State Coordinating
Office, and any adjacent communities and property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
Contact information for State and Federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate County, State and Federal
government agencies are contained in the City of New Martinsville Stream
Alteration administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of New Martinsville in
writing that the carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of
the stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the floodplain administrator.
      (3)   The floodplain administrator may require the use of certain "best
practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide to the community an agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this
agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the floodplain administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator may subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1711.08(c).

shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.  All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated 18 inches the Base Flood Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.

floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation report or certificate, based on finished
construction, must be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of
demonstrated qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the
structure in question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
            3.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion
Agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion
Agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the floodplain
administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1711.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including Subdivisions Commercial development and Manufactured
Home Parks, shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain
Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fills. In
addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other proposed new
developments which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within
the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or
two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data
and shall delineate a floodway. lf FEMA has completed a Flood Insurance Study
(FIS), that data must be used to substantiate the base  flood. Otherwise, the
developer may submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, state and local water resource departments, or technical data
developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a Flood
Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in  the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision lies partially in the floodplain area and all
proposed development will take place on natural grade a significant vertical
distance above the floodplain boundary depicted on the map, development of
detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate the area to be developed and the
location of the floodplain areas as depicted on the FEMA map. A registered
professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications must certify the site plan.

1711.06  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Design and Construction Standards.  In order to prevent excessive
damage to buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the
following restrictions apply to all development, subdivision proposals,
manufactured home parks, new construction and to construction of substantial
improvements, and the repair of substantial damage, to existing structures
occurring in the Floodplain Area.
      (1)   Basements and lowest floors.
         A.   Residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to 18 inches above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Non-residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork and utilities, elevated to 18 inches the Base Flood Elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to 18 inches above the Base
Flood Elevation.
         C.   Openings- For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.

10b as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4. The anchoring shall be
adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties,
attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate
to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
            4.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings; this type of skirting can collapse during
floods and compromise supporting piers. The openings must be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified

shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the manufactured
home has been installed to the standards set forth in this Ordinance.
      (3)   Appurtenant structures.
         A.   Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)A. hereof, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000.00.
            2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            6.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            7.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (a)(1) hereof
are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
               a.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a
copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1711.08(c).
      (4)   Recreational vehicle placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The City of New Martinsville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized. In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted unless it meets the
requirements of Section
1711.04(a). All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of New Martinsville may require
the applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill
would not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City
of New Martinsville.  During permit review the community shall consider the
following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent
properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of structures.  All buildings and structures shall be
constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon
the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All buildings and structures including stream crossings shall be
firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to prevent
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to life and
property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and
other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, and storage tanks located at or below
the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the  top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain. (Passed 9-24-09.)

approve or install a temporary electrical utility connection to any building or
premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected or rebuilt until
a placard has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator indicating that
the development has applied for a permit and agreed to the requirements of this
local law or, in the case of development occurring outside of the identified
flood hazard area, a Certificate of Compliance has been issued.

extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following criteria:

funds from, the floodplain development fund only for administrative costs
associated with management of floodplain development, the maintenance or

filed with City Recorder, in writing, within thirty (30) days after

Board.

shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the

that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.

rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a decision to allow
construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in

Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications
shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in subsection
(b)(2)E. hereof; and

shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the City of New Martinsville of not less
than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus

non-compliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons

a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in non-compliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the City

inspection by the City or its representatives.

in revoking a permit under this section, may, within thirty days from the date
of such refusal or revocation, appeal from the decision of the City to the
Circuit court of the County by presenting to the Court or the judge thereof in
vacation, after five days’ notice in writing to the City, an affidavit made by

in violation of this article.
1731.08  REMOVAL AFTER EXPIRATION OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   All outdoor advertisements, advertising signs and advertising structures
shall be removed by the permittee within thirty days after the date of the

such thirty days shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

affixes any advertisement upon or to any rock, stone, tree, fence, stump,
