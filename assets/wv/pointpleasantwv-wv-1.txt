EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
 
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

   The Marshal shall, at each regular meeting of the Council, during his
continuance in office, make a report to the Council of the money collected by
him from all sources and paid over to the Treasurer, designating specifically
the items of his said collections; and shall also at the regular meetings of
the Council in September, December, March and June, of each year, make a
detailed statement of the taxes, fines, penalties, assessments and other claims
in his hands for collection. He shall receive for his services in the
collection of taxes, the penalties collected by him as aforesaid; and for his
collection of other claims due to the City a compensation to be fixed by the
Council not exceeding five percentum on the amount duly collected and accounted
for, except that an additional percentum may be allowed in case of fines.
   At or before the regular meeting of the Council in the month of June of each
year, the Marshal, with the assistance of the Clerk, shall make up for the
current fiscal year, the three lists of persons and property delinquent for
nonpayment of taxes and real estate improperly placed on the tax duplicate or
not ascertainable, required by section twenty-one of chapter thirty of the code
as to State, County and district taxes, and all of the provisions of said
chapter, pertaining to persons and property delinquent for nonpayment of taxes
and real estate improperly charged with taxes, so far as they are applicable,
are hereby adopted and made part of this Act. The duties prescribed in said
chapter for the Sheriff, respecting such lists, shall be performed by the
Marshal, with the assistance of the Clerk, and the duties therein prescribed
for the County Court shall be performed by the Council. The provisions of the
general law, authorizing the collection of State, County and district taxes
returned delinquent, are hereby adopted and made available for the collection
of all delinquent taxes.
   The Marshal shall also return, at the same meeting, a list of such fines,
penalties, assessments and other claims in his hands for collection as he shall
not have been able to collect by reason of insolvency, removal or other cause,
to which shall be appended an affidavit that he has used due diligence to
collect the same, but has been unable to do so; and, if the Council shall be
satisfied of the correctness of said list, it shall allow him credit therefor,
but may thereafter take such lawful measures to collect such claims as shall be
by it prescribed.
SECTION 21. REMEDY AGAINST THE MARSHAL.
   If the Marshal shall fail to collect, account for and pay over all or any of
the moneys with which he may be chargeable, belonging to the City, according to
the conditions of his bond and the orders of the Council, it shall be lawful
for the Council to recover the same by action, or motion, upon ten days'
notice, in the corporate name of the City, in the Circuit Court of Mason
County, against him and his sureties, or any or either of them, or his or their
executors or administrators. If the sum claimed does not exceed three hundred
dollars, such recovery may be had before any justice of the said County.
SECTION 22. FINANCES AND EXPENDITURES.
   The Council shall annually make an estimate in manner and form as is
required by chapter nine of the acts of the legislature of West Virginia of the
year one thousand nine hundred and eight, and shall make a levy of so much as
will in its judgment be necessary to pay the same; provided, that such levy
shall not exceed fifty cents on each one hundred dollars of the assessed
valuation of the property of the City according to the last assessment thereof.
And except as to the amount of said levy as aforesaid, all of the provisions of
this Act, so far as applicable, are hereby adopted and made part hereof,
including the power to make additional levies as therein provided.
SECTION 23. PENALTY FOR THE NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.
   Upon all taxes and assessments due said City and remaining unpaid on the
first day of November of each year there shall be added thereto a penalty of
ten percent, which penalty, together with the taxes in arrears, shall be
collected by the Marshal of the City.
SECTION 24. LIEN FOR TAXES; FINES.
   There shall be a lien on real estate within said City, for the City taxes
assessed thereon, and for all assessments, fines and penalties assessed
against, or imposed upon, the owners thereof, by the authorities of such City,
and interest thereon, as in the case of State and County taxes, from the time
the same are so assessed or imposed, which shall have priority over all other
liens, except the lien for taxes due the State, County and district, and which
may be enforced by the Council in the same manner provided by law for the
enforcement of the lien for State or County taxes. If any real estate within
said City be returned delinquent for the nonpayment of taxes due thereon, a
copy of such delinquent list shall be certified by the Council to the Auditor,
and a like copy recorded in the office of the Clerk of the County Court of
Mason County, in a book kept in said office for that purpose, and to be
furnished by the City. Said real estate may be sold for the City taxes,
interest and commissions thereon, in the same manner, at the same time, and by
the same officer, as real estate is sold for the nonpayment of State taxes, and
the laws governing the sale and redemption of delinquent lands, insofar as they
are applicable, are hereby adopted and made parts of this Act.
SECTION 25. ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCES.
   The process in proceedings to enforce any ordinance prescribing a fine or
imprisonment, or a fine and imprisonment, for the violation thereof, shall be a
summons, in the name of the City of Point Pleasant, as plaintiff, directed to
the Marshal, police officer of the City, or any constable of any district
within said County, requiring him to summon the person accused of such
violation, and who may thereafter be designated as defendant, to appear before
the Mayor at any time and place therein named, to make answer to such
accusation and to be dealt with according to law. Such summons shall contain
such statement of the facts alleged as will inform such person of the general
nature of the offense against the City with which he may stand charged; and,
except in cases of arrest upon view, shall be issued only upon complaint on
oath. The Mayor shall have, possess and may exercise the power and authority of
a justice under sections two hundred and twenty-four and two hundred and
twenty-five of chapter fifty of the code of West Virginia, in summoning and
enforcing the attendance and examination of witnesses; in punishing for
contempts; in granting continuances, and in securing and enforcing the further
attendance of the accused, with a view to a trial or hearing. If any
recognizance taken for such further attendance be forfeited, the Mayor may
record the default, and an action may be maintained in the name of the City,
before any justice having jurisdiction, against the accused and his sureties,
if any, to recover the penalty thereof.
SECTION 26. ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS.
   The Mayor shall have power to issue an execution for any fine and costs
assessed or imposed by him for the violation of any ordinance, and place the
same in the hands of the Marshal, or he may at the time of rendering judgment
therefor, or at any time thereafter, and before satisfaction of such judgment,
by his order in writing, require the immediate payment thereof, and in default
of such payment, he may commit the person so in default to the prison of said
City, or in his discretion to the Jail of Mason County until the fine and costs
are fully paid; but such imprisonment shall not exceed thirty days. He shall
receive all moneys made upon said judgments, whether by execution or otherwise,
and after paying the costs to the parties entitled thereto, shall turn over the
remainder to the Treasurer on the first Monday in the month after receiving the
same, taking his receipt therefor.
SECTION 27. DUTY OF JAILER; JAIL EXPENSES.
   The Jailer of Mason County shall take and receive into his custody any
person sentenced to imprisonment in the Jail of said County, or committed
thereto for the nonpayment of a fine and costs, or for the failure to enter
into a recognizance, by the judgment or order of the Mayor, in proceedings for
the violation of an ordinance; and the expenses of maintaining such person
while so in confinement, shall be paid by the City.
SECTION 28. DOCKET.
   A book, well bound and indexed, to be denominated the "docket," shall be
kept in the office of the Mayor, in which shall be noted each case brought
before or tried by him together with the proceedings thereon, including a
statement of the complaint, the summons, the return, the fact of appearance or
nonappearance for the defense, the hearing, the judgment, the costs, and in
case the judgment be one of conviction, the action taken to enforce the same.
The record of such case shall be signed by the Mayor, and the original papers
thereof, if no appeal be taken, shall be kept together and preserved in his
office.
SECTION 29. APPEALS FROM JUDGMENTS IN CITY CASES.
   In any case of the violation of an ordinance of the said City, in which
there is a judgment by the Mayor of imprisonment for more than ten days, or for
a fine of more than ten dollars, an appeal shall lie, at the instance of the
person against whom such judgment is rendered, to the Circuit Court of Mason
County. Such appeal shall not be granted by the Mayor unless within ten days
from the date of the judgment, such person shall enter into a recognizance,
with security deemed sufficient, to appear before the said Court on the first
day of the next term thereof, to answer for the offense against the City with
which he stands charged, and not thence depart without leave of said Court. The
provisions of chapter one hundred and sixty-two of the code of West Virginia,
relating to recognizances in criminal cases, shall be applicable to the
recognizances contemplated by this section; but any money recovered thereon, or
by virtue thereof, shall inure to the said City.
SECTION 30. TRIAL IN COURT.
   If such appeal be taken, the Mayor shall forthwith deliver to the Clerk of
the said Court the complaint in writing, if any, the summons, a transcript of
the record, including the judgment, the recognizance and any other papers
belonging to the case; and such Clerk shall receive and file the same, and
place the case upon the appeal docket of the next succeeding term of said
Court; and said Court shall proceed to try the same in its order, as appeals
from justices of the peace are tried.
SECTION 31. JUDGMENT IN COURT.
   If the appellant be found guilty of a violation of the ordinance in
question, whether upon the verdict of a jury or otherwise, the Court shall
ascertain by its judgment the fine or imprisonment or the fine and
imprisonment, to be paid or suffered by such defendant, having regard to the
punishment prescribed by such ordinance, and shall include in any such judgment
the costs incurred by the said City, as well in the proceedings before the
Mayor as those in Court, including a fee to the Attorney for the City of five
dollars, and the fees, if any, of the Jailer or keeper of the City Prison; and
the proceedings to enforce the collection of any such fine and costs, may be as
provided in sections ten, eleven and twelve of chapter thirty-six of the code
of West Virginia, except that the writ mentioned in the tenth section, may be
issued by the Clerk upon the order of the Mayor of the City, and the notice
contemplated by the eleventh section shall be given to such officer. If the
judgment be for the defendant he shall recover his costs against the City.
SECTION 32. APPEALS IN OTHER CASES.
   From all judgments by the Mayor in cases other than for violation of
ordinances, appeals shall be allowed as in similar cases before justices.
SECTION 33. CHIEF OF POLICE.
   The Marshal shall be the Chief of Police and shall perform active and
constant police service, for which he shall receive a salary of not more than
fifty dollars per month. He may, with the consent of the Council, entered of
record, but not otherwise, appoint a deputy or deputies, who may perform the
duties, or any of them, with which he is charged; but the Marshal shall in all
cases be responsible for the acts or omissions of the deputy or deputies so
appointed. Such deputy or deputies shall be paid by the City.
SECTION 34. ARRESTS AND SERVICE OF PROCESS.
   In case a violation of any ordinance of said City is committed in the
presence, or within view of the Marshal or other police officer, the offender
may be forthwith apprehended and taken before the Mayor, and a complaint, under
oath, stating such violation, there lodged and filed; and, thereupon, such
offender may be tried and dealt with according to law, without summons. The
Marshal shall execute within the County of Mason any proper process issued by
the Mayor, or other proper officer, in proceedings for the enforcement of
ordinances; and shall collect, by levy of execution or otherwise, and duly
accounted for, all fines assessed and costs imposed in such proceedings. He
shall also have all the rights and powers within said City in regard to the
arrest of persons, the collection of claims and the execution and return of
process, that are or may be lawfully exercised by a constable of a district
within the same, and shall be entitled to the compensation therefor; and he and
his sureties shall be liable to all the fines, penalties and forfeitures that a
constable is liable to for any dereliction of duty in office, to be recovered
in the same manner, and in the same courts, that such fines, penalties and
forfeitures are recovered against constables.
SECTION 35. LICENSES.
   The Council shall prescribe by ordinance the manner in which licenses of all
kinds, including licenses for the keeping of dogs, shall be applied for and
granted, and shall require the payment of the tax thereon before delivery to
the person applying therefor; but the Council shall not have power to grant any
license to sell at wholesale or retail spirituous liquors, wine, porter, ale,
beer or drinks of like nature.
   And the Council may make and enforce all reasonable ordinances respecting
licenses; provided, only, that such ordinances shall not be in conflict with
the Constitution and laws of this State.
SECTION 36. CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS.
   The Council, in the name of the City, may take or damage private property,
in the manner prescribed by chapter forty-two of the code of West Virginia, for
streets, alleys, drains, market grounds, landings, wharves, City prison,
sewers, parks, cemeteries, or other work or purpose of public utility, and the
expenses of condemnation proceedings shall be borne by the City.
SECTION 37. PAVING STREETS.
   The Council, by a lawful majority thereof, may order any street, cross-
street, alley or road, or any portion thereof, to be paved in a permanent
manner, with cobblestone, brick, Belgian blocks, asphaltum or any other
suitable material. One-third of the total cost of such paving shall be borne by
the City, and the remaining two-thirds of such total cost shall be paid by the
owners of the land abutting on said street, cross-street, alley, road or
portion thereof, on the following basis, that is to say, payment is to be made
by each landowner in such proportion of two-thirds of the cost of such paving
as the frontage in feet of his land so abutting, bears to the total frontage of
all land so abutting upon such street, cross-street, alley or road, or portion
thereof so paved. Such cost, however, shall not include the grading of such
street, cross-street, alley, road, or portion thereof, nor the curbing, which
in all cases shall be done by the City.
   Before commencing such paving the Council shall cause a copy of the order
requiring the same to be published for four successive weeks in one or more
newspapers published in the City. After the completion of such work, the
Council shall apportion two-thirds of the cost thereof to the abutting
landowners, on the basis aforesaid, and assess the same severally against said
abutting landowners. Such apportionment shall be entered upon the records of
the Council and published for four successive weeks in one or more newspapers
published in the City, and any person feeling himself aggrieved by such
assessment may, on or before the completion of such publication, apply to the
Council for correction thereof.
   Said assessments shall constitute liens upon said abutting lands from the
commencement of the work, and bear interest from the date of the apportionment
of the cost as aforesaid; which liens may be enforced by suits in equity in the
name of the City, in the Circuit Court of Mason County, or the amount thereof
recovered by the City in actions against said abutting landowners in said
Court, or before any justice having jurisdiction.
SECTION 38. PAVING SIDEWALKS.
   After having caused proper curbstones to be set and placed on the outer line
of any sidewalk or footway on any of the streets, cross-streets or alleys of
said City, and the surface of the ground inside of said curbstone to be
properly graded and otherwise prepared for the purpose, the Council may require
that such sidewalk or footway be paved with brick, stone, concrete or other
suitable material, under the direction of the Street Commissioner, by the
owners respectively of the lots, or of the fractional parts of lots, facing or
abutting on such sidewalks or footways; and in case the owner of any lot or
fractional part of such lot, within reasonable time after service upon him of a
written or printed notice of such requirement, signed by the Clerk or Street
Commissioner, fails, or refuses to comply therewith, the Council may direct
that the paving contemplated by such notice be done at the expense of the City,
and when so done such expense may be assessed to such owner, and the same shall
constitute a lien on such property, which may be enforced by a suit in equity,
in the name of the City, in the Circuit Court of Mason County, or the amount
thereof recovered by the City in an action against such owner in said Court, or
before any justice having jurisdiction. In case the owner is a nonresident of
the State, notice aforesaid may be given by publication for four successive
weeks, in a newspaper published in said City. The provisions of this section
shall also be applicable to needed repairs to any of the pavements of the City,
and to the substitution of new pavements for any which may have been
heretofore, or which may be hereafter, laid and completed, and which may be
deemed insufficient.
SECTION 39. RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE CITY.
   The City of Point Pleasant shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
privileges of "The Town of Point Pleasant in Virginia," "The Town of Point
Pleasant" and "The Town of North Point Pleasant," and all of the property and
assets of the said towns shall be vested in and become the property and assets
of the "City of Point Pleasant," and it shall be liable for all the debts and
obligations of the said several towns, and subject to all the duties and
responsibilities thereof.
   And all the officers of "The Town of Point Pleasant" and "The Town of North
Point Pleasant," acting as such at the time this Act takes effect shall
continue in office until the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and
fifteen, perform the duties and receive the compensation heretofore conferred,
prescribed and allowed by their former charters or by general law or by the
ordinances of said Town; such ordinances of the Town of Point Pleasant as are
in force on the thirtieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and fifteen,
shall continue and be in force as ordinances of the City of Point Pleasant, so
far as they are not inconsistent with this Act, until amended or repealed by
the Council of the City of Point Pleasant.
SECTION 40. PROVIDING VOTING PLACES.
   For the purposes of the first election of officers under this Act the
Council and officers of the Town of Point Pleasant, so far as may be necessary,
are hereby created the Council and officers of the City of Point Pleasant, and
authorized and empowered to designate the places of voting in the several wards
of said City as herein established, and to hold and conduct said election, and
in the conduct thereof, and the ascertainment and declaration of the result
thereof, they shall be governed by the law applicable to Municipal elections.
SECTION 41. REPEALING INCONSISTENT ACTS.
   All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this Act are hereby repealed;
but this Act shall not be construed to repeal, change or modify any previous
act not inconsistent with this Act, authorizing said Town of Point Pleasant to
contract debts or to borrow money, nor to take away any of the powers conferred
upon said Town, or upon the Mayor or Council or any of the officers thereof by
general law, except so far as the same may be inconsistent with the powers

by, the right of way and/or easement possessed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
and upon which were situate railroad tracks. This portion of 14th Street is
being abandoned incident to the decision of the Common Council of the City of
Point Pleasant to permit said Railroad company to forego maintenance, and
thereby close, the railroad crossing that comprises part of 14th Street. It is
the express intention of said Council that 14th Street shall remain a public
street in all other aspects, but shall be abandoned at the juncture of the
street and the right of way and easement of said railroad.
   (c)   That portion of Court Street beginning at the intersection of said
Court Street and the Easterly lane of 7th Street, and extending in a Southerly
direction a distance of approximately 203.5 feet to a point, said point being
twelve feet North of where the lands of Stephen C. Littlepage intersect with
said Court Street. The said Court Street being an alley located between, and
running parallel to, Viand Street and Main Street and being situate to the
immediate West of the Trinity United Methodist Church building. The Council is
aware of the fact that the said Trinity United Methodist Church shall make
appropriate accommodations to permit the public access to the rear of the
properties fronting on Sixth Street. Thus, Council has determined that adequate
provision has been made to ensure the public's continued access to areas
previously accessible by the portion of said Court Street that is abandoned
hereby.
   (d)   That portion of Marietta Street that begins at its intersection with
Monroe Avenue and extending in a northerly direction to its intersection with
Madison Avenue. The Council notes that this portion of said Marietta Street
does appear upon one or more maps of the City of Point Pleasant, yet it does
not appear that the above-described portion of said street has ever been
developed or maintained by the City of Point Pleasant, nor does it appear that
the same has ever been used as a street by the citizens of said City.
   (e)   North Street in its entirety. The Council notes that said North Street
does appear upon one or more maps of the City of Point Pleasant, yet it does
not appear that said street has ever been developed or maintained by the City
of Point Pleasant, nor does it appear that the same has ever been used as a
street by the citizens of said City. Further, the Council was provided a
Petition, signed by all current owners of real estate situate between North
Street and Jefferson Boulevard, requesting the abandonment of the entirety of
North Street.
   (f)   That portion of Washington Avenue situate upon, over, and/or across
those certain parcels of real estate identified as Tax Map No. 262, Parcels 30
and 31. The Council notes that said Washington Avenue does appear upon one or
more maps of the City of Point Pleasant, yet it does not appear that said
street has ever been developed or maintained by the City of Point Pleasant, nor
does it appear that the same has ever been used as a street by the citizens of
said City. Further, said portion of Washington Avenue provides access only to
the parcels of real estate identified as Tax Map No. 262, Parcels 30 and 31,
and the current record owner(s) of both said parcels have requested abandonment
of the same.

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)    Green alone or "go":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)    Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)    Red alone or "stop":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice. (WVaC 17C-3-8)

period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may

Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of

successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.

statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any

Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
 333.01  or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this
section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for
purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of
a crime, except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq.

he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his
or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in
response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any
inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section

run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.

objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the

and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

731.02 IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.

against the persons, on account of the business and other activities, and in

gross income as set forth in Sections
731.03 to
731.12.
   If any person liable for any tax under Section
731.03 or
731.04, shall ship or transport his products or any part thereof out of the
City without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of
the City shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in such
sections, except in those instances in which another measure of the tax is
expressly provided. Council shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for
ascertaining such value.
   In determining value, however, regarding sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale,
Council shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining the value
upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as
possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like
quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections
731.03 and
731.04 shall neither be added nor deducted in computing the tax levied under
the other sections of this article.
   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Sections
731.03 or
731.04 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products at retail in this City shall be required to make returns
of the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed in Section
731.05 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such natural
resources or manufactured products at retail in this City. But any person
exercising any privilege taxable under Sections
731.03 or
731.04 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products to producers of natural resources, manufacturers,
wholesalers, jobbers, retailers or commercial consumers for use in or
consumption in the purchaser's business shall not be required to pay the tax
imposed in Section
731.05.
   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under Section
731.04 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in Section
731.05 for the privilege of selling their manufactured products for delivery
outside of this City, but the gross income derived from the sale of such
manufactured products outside of this City shall be included in determining the
measure of the tax imposed on such manufacturer in Section
731.04.
   A person exercising privileges taxable under the other sections of this
article, producing coal, oil, natural gas, minerals, timber or other natural
resource products the production of which is taxable under Section

delivering the same as a royalty payment, in kind, or the like, shall be deemed
to be engaged in the business of mining and producing coal, oil, natural gas,
minerals, timber or other natural resource products for sale, profit or
commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on account of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds or the equivalent in
accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the value upon
which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as possible
to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character by other taxpayers, which rules Council shall prescribe.

compounded or prepared in this City for sale, profit or commercial use,
regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to
points outside the City. However, the dressing and processing of food by a
person, firm or corporation, which food is to be sold on a wholesale basis by

Treasurer, for a hearing and correction of the amount of the tax so assessed
upon him by the Mayor and City Treasurer, in which petition shall be set forth
the reason why the hearing should be granted and the amount such taxes should
be reduced. Council shall promptly consider such petition, and may grant the
hearing or may deny the same. If denied, the petitioner shall forthwith be
notified thereof, but if granted, Council shall notify the petitioner of the
time and place fixed for such hearing. After the hearing, Council may make such
order in the matter as may appear to be just and lawful, and shall furnish a
copy of the order to the petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any
tax, and required to pay the same may recover the amount paid together with
interest, in the proper action or suit against the City, as may be authorized
by law. (8-9-71)
731.19 TAX YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes herein made and the returns required therefor, shall
be for the three calendar months beginning October 1, 1971, and ending December
31, 1971, and for each twelve-month period ending on December 31 of each
calendar year thereafter that this article remains in effect.

pay taxes for the year covering his accounting period, as shown by the method

      (2)   If the City desires to file a notice of lien with the Clerk of the
Mason County Commission regarding one or more delinquencies in payment of any
municipal fee, penalties or interest, the city shall give the delinquent fee
payer written notice via certified U.S. Mail return receipt requested to such
fee payer's last known address, of intent to file the notice of lien setting
forth the amounts due and status of delinquency. Unless the fee payer to whom
the notice is given, or his duly authorized agent, shall within thirty (30)
days after service thereof, either personally or by certified mail, file with
the City a petition for hearing, setting forth with particular items objected
to, together with the reasons for objections, the City may at any time

examiner, the fee payer may appeal the decision of the municipal judge or

after service of the hearing examiner's or municipal judge's decision.
      (1)   The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the City as an
original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it shall, with the
return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the Office of the Clerk of the Mason

unless the fee payer shall file with such clerk a bond for the use of the
defendant, with sureties approved by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Mason
County, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the total amount of the
fee, and accumulated penalties and interest to the date of the appeal, and
conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the Mason County
Circuit Court; provided, that the judge of the Mason County Circuit Court may
stay the collection of the fee, and accumulated penalties without the
requirement of a bond, upon a proper showing by the plaintiff that the
properties of the plaintiff are sufficient to secure performance of the Mason
County Circuit Court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served
thereby.
      (3)   The Mason County Circuit Court shall hear the appeal and determine
anew all questions submitted to it on appeal from the decision of the City
municipal judge or hearing examiner.
   (f)    The administrative remedies set forth in this section are exclusive.
Failure to timely file a petition in accordance with this section shall
preclude any challenge to the filing of the notice of lien. If no appeal is
taken pursuant to this section within thirty (30) days after service of the
municipal judge or hearing examiner's decision, said decision shall become
final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or judicial review.
   (g)    The lien created by this section shall continue until the fee
delinquency is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.
The City shall issue a certificate of release of any lien imposed pursuant to
this section upon finding that the delinquency has been satisfied or the lien
has become legally unenforceable. The lien created by this section shall be

the provisions of this section shall be personally liable for any taxes accrued

taxing authority, he shall be personally liable for such amount as he failed to
collect or remit; however, such hotel operator shall not be held liable for

regarded as having accrued until either the date on which it is received by the
hotel operator or the expiration of the 30-day payment period set forth in
Section
767.09 whichever shall first occur. The hotel operator shall, on before the
15th day of each month, prepare and deliver to the City a return for the
preceding month, in the form prescribed by the City. Such form shall include
all information necessary for the computation, collection and subsequent
distribution of the tax as the City may require. A remittance for the amount of

or penalties which may be imposed by state law, City ordinance, order of the

   Roof drains, yard and area drains, footer drains or any line carrying flow
other than exclusively sanitary wastewater is prohibited from connection to the
sanitary sewer system.
   (f)   Establishment of Schedule of Rates and Charges; Use of Water Meters.
For the payment of the proper and reasonable expense of operation, repair,
replacements, improvements, additions, betterments, extensions and maintenance
of the sewer system and for the payment of the sums required to pay the
principal and interest of all sewer revenue bonds as they become due, Council
shall enact and may from time to time amend a schedule of just and equitable
rates or charges for the use of and service rendered by the municipal sewer
system and works of the City, which schedule of rates or charges shall be based
upon the metered amount of water supplied the premises; and each schedule shall
be maintained on file in the office of the City while it is in effect.
   Until such time as Council adopts a schedule of rates or charges pursuant to
the foregoing provisions of this section, the rates and charges in effect
immediately prior to the effective date of this article shall continue in full
force and effect.
   (g)   Established Rates Applicable to Premises Subsequently Served. The
rates or charges so established for any class of users or property served shall
be extended to cover any additional premises hereafter served which fall within
the same class, without the necessity of any hearing or notice.
   (h)   City Subject to Established Rates or Charges. The City shall be
subject to the established charges and rates, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith, for services rendered the City and shall pay

within thirty days after they become due, then the amount thereof, together
with a penalty of ten percent (10%) and a reasonable attorney's fee, may be
recovered by Council in a civil action in the name of the City. In connection
with such action, such lien may be foreclosed against such lot, parcel of land
or building, in accordance with the laws relating thereto.
   (k)   Industrial Use of Sewers. Where the character of sewage from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes
a burden upon the sewer system in addition to the burden imposed by the average
sewage entering the sewer system, such additional charge shall be made therefor
as Council deems to be fair and equitable to meet the additional cost of
collection, treatment and disposal of such sewage; and Council may, if it deems
advisable to do so, compel the owner, tenant or occupant of such manufacturing
or industrial plant, building or premises to treat the sewage in such manner as
shall be specified by Council before discharging into the sewer system.
   (l)   Duration of Liability for Sewer Service. Liability for service shall
begin as to all users on the date of connection to the sewer system; and such
liability shall continue thereafter unless such premises are disconnected from
the sewer system with the approval of Council. After such liability begins, no

feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc.
either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (d)   Toxic Substances. The following described substances, materials,
waters or waste shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property
or constitute a nuisance. The Manager may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations if in his opinion such more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion
as to the acceptability, the Manager shall give consideration to such factors
as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant

"slug" as defined herein.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition
deleterious to structure and treatment processes.
   (e)   Conditional Service. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof
and which in the judgment of the Manager may have a deleterious effect upon the

EDITOR'S NOTE: Article
935 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Point Pleasant ("Sewer Fees and
Charges") was amended and re-enacted by City Council in 2008. First reading of
said amendment and re-enactment passed in October, 2008. Second reading passed
in November, 2008. Third and final reading passed in December, 2008. Pursuant
to the amended and re-enacted ordinance, the new rates were to take effect
February 1, 2009. A formal protest of the amended rates was filed by a lone
citizen subsequent to the passage of the amended rates, but prior to the same
going into effect. Upon the filing of the protest, the West Virginia Public
Service Commission asserted jurisdiction over the City's sewer rates and
performed a cost-of-service study. By Recommended Decision entered by the WVPSC
on June 1, 2009, the ordinance previously amended and re-enacted by City
Council was disapproved and set aside. The WVPSC entered a Commission Order on
June 30, 2009 which adopted the rates set out in the WVPSC's Recommended
Decision as the final order of the WVPSC. Said new rates became effective
August 1, 2009. Subsequently, this ordinance was amended to reflect the rates
applicable to the City's Combined Sewer Overflow plan. Said rates went into
effect in two (2) phases. The first phase was effective 45 days from passage.
The second phase went into effect upon substantial project completion or
commencement of project debt service.

   (h)   Incremental Costs $5.00 per 1,000 gallons. An amount not to exceed
$5.00 per 1,000 gallons is to be used when a bill reflects unusual consumption
which can be attributed to eligible leakage on the customer's side of the
meter. This rate shall be applied to all such consumption above the customer's
historical average usage. The Utility shall establish a non-discriminatory
policy regarding this provision for leak adjustments.
   (i)   EFT, ACH, Credit Card and Drop Box Payments. A service charge will be

provisions of West Virginia Code 8-19-12a(a)(2) and PSC Water Rules, Rule
4.2.a1 shall apply to the Utility. Application of these provisions of statutory
language to the Utility produces a security deposit of $76.00 for residential
customers.
SCHEDULE II – Effective 45 Days from Passage
   (k)   Surcharge Formula to be Applied Where Surface Drainage is Connected to
the Utility's Sanitary Sewer System. Where the Utility has discovered that a
customer's roof drain, down spouts, storm sewer or other similar facilities
conducting surface water have been connected to the Utility's sewer system, and
such customer has failed to take appropriate action, within thirty (30) days of
receipt of a demand by the Utility in accordance with the Rules and Regulations
of the Public Service Commission, to eliminate such connection, a surcharge
will be imposed upon the customer calculated on the basis of the following
formula:
               S = A x R x .0006233 x C
         S       -   The surcharge in dollars.
         A      -   The are under roof and/or the are of any other water
collection surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet.
         R      -   The measured monthly rainfall, in inches.
         .0006233 -   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square
feet of surface to thousands of gallons of water.
         C -   The Utility's approved rate per thousand gallons of metered
water usage.
   The Utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand-delivery,
that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site
inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer's location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water
from the sanitary sewer system.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.

the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the Utility, should not be introduced into
the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results of this preliminary
study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service
and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out above.
   Thereafter unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit
of the Utility records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the
above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be paid
by the unusual user. Based on these audited figures, additional billings
covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or
refund given by the Utility, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then

structures, poles, other lines, and equipment installed or erected by Grantee
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of

reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any of
such Public Ways. Grantee shall use its best efforts to maintain a quiet and
clean work place whenever working in the Public Way.
   (b)   Restoration of Public Ways. If during the course of Grantee's
construction, operation, or maintenance of the Cable System there occurs a

   (c)   Relocation at Request of Franchising Authority. Upon its receipt of
reasonable advance notice, not to be less than 30 days, Grantee shall, at its
own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the Public
Way, or remove from the Public Way, any property of Grantee when lawfully
required by Franchising Authority by reason of traffic conditions, public
safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water
pipes, or any other type of structures or improvements by Franchising

trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of its Cable System in the
Service Area so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with Grantee's
wires, cables, or other equipment. Grantee shall be permitted to charge Persons
who own, or are responsible for, such trees or natural growth for the cost of
such trimming, provided that similar charges are assessed by and paid to the
utilities of Franchising Authority for tree trimming. Grantee shall reasonably
compensate Franchising Authority or property owner for any damages caused by
such trimming, or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and
expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any
construction of the System undertaken by Grantee. Such replacement shall
satisfy any and all obligations Grantee may have to Franchising Authority or
property owner pursuant to the terms of this Section.
   (f)   Safety Requirements. Construction, installation, and maintenance of
the Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All
such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or
other federal, state, and local regulations. The Cable System shall not
unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of Persons or property in
the Service Area.
   (g)   Aerial and Underground Construction. In those areas of the Service
Area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective
public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
underground, Grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided that such
facilities are actually capable of receiving Grantee's cable and other
equipment without technical degradation of the Cable System's signal quality.
In those areas of the Service Area where the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, Grantee
shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or
underground. Nothing contained in this subsection (g) shall require Grantee to
construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances
such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters,
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related
equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection (g), in the event that all of the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective
date of this Ordinance, Grantee shall only be required to construct, operate,
and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if
it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at
the time that such are placed underground.   
   (h)   Required Extensions of Service.  The Cable System, as constructed as
of the date of the passage and final adoption of this Ordinance, substantially
complies with the material provisions hereof. Grantee is hereby authorized to
extend the Cable System as necessary, as desirable, or as required pursuant to
the terms hereof within the Service Area. Whenever Grantee shall receive a
request for service from at least thirty (30) residential dwellings within one
(1) mile of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its Cable System
to such dwellings at no cost to the subscriber for system extension, other than
the usual connection fees for all Subscribers; provided that such extension is
technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the Cable System, or as provided
for under subsection (i) hereof.
   (i)   Subscriber Charges for Extensions of Service. No Subscriber shall be
refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a
Subscriber's request to locate a cable drop underground, existence of more than
one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance from distribution cable to connection
of service to Subscribers, or a density as described in subsection (h) hereof,
Cable Service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in
aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements.
Potential Subscribers shall bear the costs of the construction and other costs
on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require payment in advance of the capital
contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers.
   (j)   Service to Public Schools. Grantee shall provide without charge one
(1) outlet of Basic Cable to municipal buildings and public elementary, junior,
middle and high schools that are passed by its Cable System. The outlets of
Basic Cable shall not be used to distribute or sell Cable Service in or
throughout such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or
public areas open to the public. Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee
harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such
outlets, including, but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this subsection (j),
Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the
drop line from the feeder cable to such buildings or premises exceeds one
hundred fifty (150) cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and it will
not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development
of the Cable System to do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity
agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable
feet. In the event that additional outlets of Basic Cable are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated
therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of
Grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees
associated with the provision of Basic Cable and the additional outlets
relating thereto. (Passed 12-11-11)
945.04 REGULATION BY FRANCHISING AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Franchise Fee.
      (1)   Grantee shall pay to Franchising Authority a franchise fee equal to
five percent (5%) of Gross Revenues from the provision of Cable Services within
the Franchise Area received by Grantee on a quarterly basis; provided, however,
that Grantee may credit against any such payments: (i) any tax, fee, or
assessment of any kind imposed by Franchising Authority or other governmental
entity on a cable operator, or Subscriber, or both, solely because of their
status as such; (ii) any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability which
is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or Subscribers (including any
such tax, fee, or assessment imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and
their services), and (iii) any other special tax, assessment, or fee such as a
business, occupation, and entertainment tax. For the purpose of this Section,
the three-month period applicable under the Franchise for the computation of
the franchise fee shall be a calendar quarter, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by Franchising Authority and Grantee. The franchise fee payment shall
be due and payable thirty (30) days after the close of the preceding calendar
quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a letter from a representative of
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
      (2)   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from
the date on which payment by Grantee is due. Unless within three (3) years from
and after such payment due date Franchising Authority initiates a lawsuit for
recovery of franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, recovery shall
be barred and Franchising Authority shall be stopped from asserting any claims
whatsoever against Grantee relating to alleged franchise fee deficiencies.
   (b)   Rates and Charges. Franchising Authority may not regulate the rates
for the provision of Cable Service or other service, including, but not limited
to, ancillary charges relating thereto, except as expressly provided herein and
except as may be authorized pursuant to federal and state law. From time to
time, and at any time, Grantee has the right to modify its rates and charges,
at its discretion and without consent of Franchising Authority, including, but
not limited to, the implementation of additional charges and rates; provided,
however, that Grantee shall give notice to Franchising Authority of any such
modifications or additional charges thirty (30) days prior to the effective
date thereof.
   (c)   Conditions of Sale. Except to the extent expressly required by federal
or state law, if a renewal or extension of the Franchise is denied or the
Franchise is lawfully terminated, and Franchising Authority either lawfully
acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market value, determined on the
basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern.
   Grantee and Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a lawful
revocation of the Franchise, at Grantee's request, which shall be made in its
sole discretion, Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate
a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Franchising
Authority further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize
Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise;
however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater
than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end
of that time, Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or
assignee of its Cable System which is reasonably acceptable to Franchising
Authority, Grantee and Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights
they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that
Grantee's continued operation of its Cable System during the six (6) month
period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights
of either Franchising Authority or Grantee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this subsection (c), neither Franchising Authority nor
Grantee shall be required to violate federal or state law.
   (d)   Transfer of Franchise. All of the rights and privileges and all of the
obligations, duties and liabilities created by this Franchise shall pass to and
be binding upon the successors of the Franchising Authority and the successors
and assigns of Grantee; and the same shall not be assigned or transferred
without the written approval of the City Council, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that this Section shall not prevent
the assignment or hypothecation of the Franchise by Grantee as security for
debt without such approval; and provided further that transfers or assignments
of this Franchise between any parent and subsidiary corporation or between
entities of which at least fifty percent (50%) of the beneficial ownership is
held by the same person, persons, or entities which are controlled or managed
by the same person, persons, or entities, shall be permitted without the prior
approval of the Franchising Authority("intracompany transfers"). Grantee shall
notify Franchising Authority in writing within 30 days of the closing of such
intracompany transfer.
(Passed 12-11-11)
945.05 COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING.
   (a)   Books and Records. Grantee agrees that Franchising Authority may
review such of Grantee's books and records, during normal business hours and on
a nondisruptive basis, as are reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with
the terms hereof. Such records include, but are not limited to, any public
records required to be kept by Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set fotih herein, Grantee
shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature. Franchising Authority agrees to treat
any information disclosed to it by Grantee as confidential, and to disclose it
only to employees, representatives, and agents of Franchising Authority that
have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
(Passed 12-11-11)
945.06 INSURANCE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND BONDS OR OTHER SURETY.
   (a)   Insurance Requirements.
      (1)   The Grantee shall maintain throughout the term of the Franchise
insurance in amounts at least as follows:
Workers’ Compensation                  Statutory Limits
                                         $1,000,000 per occurrence, Combined
Commercial General Liability             Single Liability (C.S.L.) $2,000,000
                                         General Aggregate
Auto Liability including coverage on all $1,000,000 per occurrence C.S.L.
owned, non-owned hired autos
Umbrella Liability                       $1,000,000 per occurrence C.S.L.
 
      (2)   The Grantor shall be added as an additional insured to the above
Commercial General Liability, Auto Liability and Umbrella Liability insurance
coverage.
      (3)   The Grantee shall furnish the Grantor with current certificates of
insurance evidencing such coverage upon request.
   (b)   Indemnification. Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless,
and defend Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and
against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting
from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise
out of Grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of its Cable System,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
   (c)   Bonds and other Surety. Except as expressly provided herein, Grantee
shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a
condition of being awarded the Franchise or continuing its existence.
Franchising Authority acknowledges that the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of Grantee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of
the Franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee and Franchising Authority
recognize that the costs associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately
be borne by the Subscribers in the form of increased rates for Cable Service or
other service. In order to minimize such costs, Franchising Authority agrees to
require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as
there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. Franchising Authority agrees
that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in
an aggregate amount greater than $10,000, conditioned upon the substantial
performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the Franchise.
Initially, no bond or other surety shall be required. In the event that one is
required in the future, Franchising Authority agrees to give Grantee at least
sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the
requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in Grantee's legal,
financial, or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or
impair its ability to comply with the terms of the Franchise or afford
compliance therewith.
(Passed 12-11-11)
945.07 ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.

that Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, it shall notify
Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged default.

from receipt of the notice described in subsection (a) hereof:
      (1)   To respond to Franchising Authority contesting the assertion of
default;
      (2)   To cure such default; or
      (3)   In the event that, by the nature of the default, such default
cannot be cured within the sixty (60) day period, to initiate reasonable steps
to remedy such default and to notify Franchising Authority of the steps being

with the enforcement of any provision of this article or of any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, may request and shall be granted a hearing
on the matter before the Enforcement Agency; provided that such person shall
file in the office of the Enforcement Agency a written petition requesting such
hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor within ten
days after the day the notice was served. Upon receipt of such petition, the
Enforcement Agency shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall give
the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be
given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such notice should be modified
or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than ten days after the
date on which the petition was filed; provided, that upon application of the
petitioner, the Enforcement Agency may postpone the date of the hearing for a
reasonable time beyond such ten-day period, if, in its judgment, the petitioner
has submitted a good and sufficient reason for such postponement. Any hearing
conducted by the Enforcement Agency shall be electronically recorded on audio
tape and kept as a permanent record of the hearings had and conducted by the
Enforcement Agency.
   (c)   After such hearing, the Enforcement Agency shall sustain, modify or
withdraw the notice, depending upon its finding as to whether the provisions of
this article and of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto have
been complied with. If the Enforcement Agency sustains or modifies such notice,
it shall be deemed to be an order. Any notice served pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof shall automatically become an order if a written petition for a hearing
is not filed in the office of the Enforcement Agency within ten days after such
notice is served. After a hearing, in the case of any notice suspending any
permit required by this article, or by any rule or regulation adopted pursuant
thereto, when such notice has been sustained by the Enforcement Agency, the
permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit which has been
suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if a petition
for hearing is not filed in the office of the Enforcement Agency within ten
days after such notice is served.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decision
of the Enforcement Agency, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered
as a matter of public record in the office of the Enforcement Agency. Such
record shall also include a copy of every notice or order issued in connection
with the matter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Enforcement Agency
may apply to the Circuit Court of Mason County, West Virginia for a temporary
injunction restraining the Enforcement Agency pending final disposition of the
cause as is provided by law.
   (e)   Whenever the Enforcement Agency finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health, it may, without notice
or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and
requiring that such action be taken as it deems necessary to meet the
emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, such order
shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall
comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Enforcement Agency,
shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending
upon its findings as to whether the provisions of this article and of the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with, the
Enforcement Agency shall continue such order in effect, modify it or revoke it.

1105.04 DEMOLITION OF SUBSTANDARD DWELLING UNITS.
   (a)   The Building Inspector shall make periodic inspections of any dwelling
vacated as unfit for human habitation or any other vacant structure. Whenever
an inspection of the structure discloses that the structure by reason of its
being a rat harborage or for any other reason has become a public nuisance or a
hazard to the health, safety or welfare of the public, the Building Inspector
shall issue a report with recommendations to the Enforcement Agency. The
Enforcement Agency shall, in its discretion if warranted, issue a written
notice requiring the owner, within a reasonable time specified in the notice,
to rectify the conditions constituting the nuisance, or to remove or demolish
the structure. Such removal or demolition shall not be ordered unless the cost
of such repair, alteration or improvement shall exceed fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure. If requested by the property owner, a board
of three appraisers shall be appointed to decide the market value. Each party
shall select one appraiser, who, in turn, shall select the third. Any fees
engendered through action shall be borne by the property owner. At the time of
action, service of the notice shall be made in accordance with Section
1105.03.
   (b)   If the owner fails to rectify such conditions and the cost of
rectifying the same shall be less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value
of the structure, the Enforcement Agency may cause such repairs, alterations or
improvements to be made. The amount of such cost of alterations or
improvements, vacating or closing or removal or demolition shall be a Municipal
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. If the
structure is removed or demolished by order of the Enforcement Agency, it shall
sell the materials of such structure for the best price attainable, and shall
credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of removal or demolition, and
any such balance remaining shall be disbursed to the owner.

areas which should be reserved for agriculture and forestry.

1317.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The statement of purpose and the permitted and conditional uses for
each district are set forth in the following Sections
1317.02 to
1317.12. The interpretation of uses given in categorical terms shall be as
defined in Article
1309. Uses not specifically listed or interpreted to be included categorically
under this article and Article
1313 shall not be permitted except by amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.
 
   (b)   Accessory uses and essential services as defined in Article
1309 are permitted uses in all districts.
1317.02 "S-1" SPECIAL.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is provided to conserve as open
space those areas in urban and urbanizing sections of the City because of steep
terrain, streams and storm drainage, woodlands, natural scenic assets and
adaptability for recreational purposes. The specific intent of this section is:
      (1)   To prevent the use of steeply sloping land for urban purposes and
thereby avoid hillside areas that are too costly to develop with all necessary
community services.
      (2)   To conserve stream and drainage channels and prevent encroachment
of urban uses to the extent that they interfere with the natural flows of storm
water.
      (3)   To reserve naturally attractive scenic areas and woodlands for
recreational purposes.
      (4)   To recognize public and semipublic areas which, because of the open
character of their development, should be classified as open space.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.

1317.03 "AF" AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is composed of large open land
areas and it is intended that the open character of this land be preserved
through limiting uses to open, recreational, agricultural, forestry and other
similar uses. Residential uses will be permitted in conjunction with the above
uses and in other open areas where acreage requirements are met. The specific
intent of this section is:
      (1)   To prevent the intermingling or scattering within these districts
of concentrated residential uses, sales operations, service operations, or
other activities or uses which would require public facilities such as sewers
and water, and fire and police protection.
      (2)   To discourage those uses which tend to attract population growth
and require residential areas for their fulfillment.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.

1317.04 "SR" SUBURBAN RESIDENCE.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is provided in recognition of the
sections of the City where very low density residential development is
appropriate. The specific intent of this section is:
      (1)   To prohibit business, commercial or industrial use of the land, and
to prohibit any other nonresidential use which would substantially interfere
with development or continuation of residential use in the district.
      (2)   To discourage any land use which would generate traffic on minor or
local streets, other than normal traffic to serve the residences of those
streets.
      (3)   To discourage any use which, because of its character and size,
would create requirements and costs for public services such as fire and police
protection, water supply and sewerage, substantially in excess of such
requirements and costs if the districts were developed solely for residential
use.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.

1317.08 "B-1" CENTRAL BUSINESS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district encompasses the central business
area where there is a broad range of individual commercial establishments
leading to a high level of general commercial activity. Because these
commercial, service and governmental uses are subject to public view by large
numbers of persons from the community and surrounding area they should provide
for appropriate appearance and patron convenience. Ample parking, separation of
pedestrian and traffic movement and suitable landscaping should be provided.
The proper development of this district is not only a right under the law, but
a responsibility to the entire community or region served.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      General business
      Personal services
      Business services
      Professional activities
      Offices and banks

1317.09 "B-2" NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is provided in recognition of the
need to permit retail business and service uses to serve the daily needs of the
nearby residential areas. Other uses which serve larger areas and/or
"comparison" shopping needs are not encouraged and therefore the size of the
various uses is limited. The further intent is to encourage the concentration
of local business at certain strategic locations and to avoid extension of
marginal strip business along the length of streets and roads near residential
areas.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      Local retail business
      Personal services
      Professional activities
      Offices and banks
      Restaurants
      Funeral home
      Semipublic and public uses

      Clinics
      Social activities
      Public and semipublic uses
      Public service facility
1317.10 "B-3" HIGHWAY AND GENERAL BUSINESS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is intended to provide for
highway-oriented and general business establishments. Activities accommodated
include business and professional services, repair, automobile sales and
certain processing establishments serving a large trade area. The trade area
population served by these establishments requires easy access, although
patronage is more dispersed and visits to these establishments less frequent
than in other commercial zoning districts. It is the intent of these
regulations that establishments desiring location along major traffic routes be
grouped and that adequate access be provided. Because these establishments are
subject to the public view, which is a matter of important concern to the whole
community, they should provide an appropriate appearance and suitable
landscaping. It is further intended that establishments in this district be
separated from residential and other less intensely developed land use areas by
physical barriers or adequate space and screening.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      Drive-in commercial uses
      General business
      Personal services
      Professional activities
      Business services
      Office and banks
      Restaurants and taverns
      Social activities
      Commercial entertainment facilities

      Automotive sales and repair
      Farm implement sales and service
      Public and semipublic uses
      Funeral home
      Multiple family dwelling
      Commercial recreation facilities
      Hotels & Motels
      Commercial entertainment facilities (8-25-03)
   (c)   Conditional Uses Requiring Board Approval.
      Bakeries and dairies
      Printing and publishing
      Animal hospitals and clinics
      Wholesale business
      Commercial recreational facilities
      Sales and storage of building materials
      Transport and trucking terminals
      Billboards and advertising signs
      Public service facility
1317.11 "M-1" RESTRICTED INDUSTRY.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is provided in recognition of
industrial uses which seek locations in suburban areas or in proximity to
residential areas. These industrial uses do not require railroad trackage and
generally require a minimum of services and generate little industrial traffic.
They typically operate within an enclosed structure and have little or no
adverse effect on adjacent land by producing noise, odor, dust, smoke, glare or
hazard.
   It is intended to define and protect industrial areas of controlled
operation and attractive development from the intrusion of uses not performing
a function appropriate to a restricted industrial environment. This district is
intended to encourage areas of industrial use with architecturally attractive
structures surrounded by landscaped yards. Such development may be in proximity
to other land use areas, including residential, but is best accomplished at the
periphery of such areas, and should be separated by identifiable physical
boundaries wherever possible.
   It is not intended that any new residential development be permitted in the
"M-1" district.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      Restricted manufacturing
      Offices
      Research and testing facilities
      Public service facility
      Printing and publishing
      Animal hospital & clinics
      Commercial recreational facility (8-25-03)
   (c)   Conditional Uses Requiring Board Approval.
      Restaurants
      Food processing
      Warehousing
      Wholesale business
1317.12 "M-2" GENERAL INDUSTRY.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. This district is intended to define areas
suitable for the location and space needs of a broad variety of industrial
activities. The permitted industrial uses shall be primarily of a
manufacturing, assembly and fabrication nature. These uses should be protected
from the intrusion of other land uses which do not perform a function
appropriate to the district nor provide essential services. Important is the
accessibility to regional transportation facilities and public utilities. The
topography of the area should be relatively level with no flood hazard;
however, hillside areas may also be used where appropriate. These industrial
areas may be in proximity to other land use areas, but wherever possible
appropriate physical features, such as hillsides or ridges, should be used as
boundaries.
   It is not intended that any new residential development be permitted in the
"M-2" district.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      General industry
      Manufacturing, sale and storage of building materials
      Transport and trucking terminals
      Wholesale and warehousing activities
      Food processing
      Bakeries and dairies (8-25-03)
   (c)   Conditional Uses Requiring Board Approval.
      Restaurants
      Billboards and advertising signs
      Mineral extraction, storage and processing
      Auto wrecking, salvage and storage
      Material and equipment salvage and storage
      Airport and landing strips

1339.04     Planned unit development requirements.
 
 
1339.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The City officials concerned with property development shall take into
account that it is increasingly difficult to forecast the various conditions
and factors that may be encountered in sizeable developments, and that certain
latitude, flexibility and freedom in the execution of the design and layout of
a project should be suggested or otherwise permitted by the City so as to
encourage the developer to adjust the streets to irregular topography; to take
advantage of topography in order to utilize the natural surface drainage; to
economize in the construction of sewers and storm drainage facilities; to
reduce the amount of grading and thus minimize destruction of trees and
topsoil; to adjust the layout to geographical and cultural limitations such as
property ownership lines; and, among other things, to create architectural
variation in the development as well as attractive and usable buildings and
building sites; and further, such developments shall be designed so as to
enhance the community in general by providing amenities which are unique to the
community.
 
   (b)   Planned unit developments may be residential, commercial or industrial
developments, or they may be combinations of uses, such as residential and
commercial, or commercial and industrial. The minimum site area for a
residential development shall be six acres; for a commercial development, three
acres; and for an industrial development, ten acres. If a combination of uses
is proposed, a residential-commercial development shall have a minimum of
fifteen acres, and a commercial-industrial development, a minimum of fifteen
acres.
 
   (c)   Plans for a planned unit development shall be submitted to the
Municipality and shall be referred to the Planning Commission for study and
conducting of a public hearing by Council. Notice and publication of such
public hearings shall conform to the procedures prescribed in Article 1355 for
hearings on changes and amendments.
1339.02 REQUIRED PLANS AND ACTIONS BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   In order for the Planning Commission to better determine that the
planned unit development meets all requirements, the developer shall furnish a
preliminary plan of the entire tract showing topography, roads, lot lines, lot
areas, easements, encumbrances and other relevant data. The plans shall include
the location of existing structures, areas of shrubs and/or trees of ten-inch
diameter or more, existing contours and the proposed grading plan.
 
   (b)   Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed planned unit
development project as shown by the preliminary plan conforms to the
requirements of all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, the
proponent shall prepare and submit a final development plan, and such plan
shall incorporate any changes or modifications required by the Commission.
 
   (c)   Upon approval by the Commission, the plans shall be submitted to
Council for consideration and action. The approval and recommendations of the
Commission shall be based on the following general conditions:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this
ordinance to promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
      (2)   The use of the land shall be similar to the uses permitted in the
district in which the plan is located.
   (d)   The following documents shall be submitted with the final development
plan:
      (1)   A development schedule indicating the anticipated time of
completion for the project as a whole and for separate stages.
      (2)   Proposed protective covenants, deed restrictions, and form of
notices to property owners relative to their interests and responsibilities
with respect to open space and recreation facilities.
      (3)   Description of form of organization to be followed in the
establishment of a property owners' association in the event that care and
maintenance of common open space and recreation facilities is to be a
responsibility of property owners.
1339.03 ACCEPTANCE BY ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Following a public hearing, Council may modify the plan, consistent
with the intent and meaning of this Zoning Ordinance, and may rezone the
property to the classification permitting the proposal, for development in
substantial conformity with the final plan as approved by Council.
 
   (b)   After the final development plan has been approved by Council and in
carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights or yards may be requested by the proponents, and
provided such requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and this Zoning Ordinance, such adjustments or rearrangements
may be authorized by the Planning Commission.
1339.04 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   Planned unit developments shall be encouraged, but they shall conform to the
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance or to the following modifications of the
regulations found elsewhere in this Ordinance.
   (a)   "SR" or "R" Districts. In "SR" or "R" Districts, a planned unit

"R-3"    7         9          12              18
         The calculation of residential density shall include all land devoted
to residential use, and shall further include easements for utilities except
major facilities which do not serve individual dwellings, minor surface
drainage channels, recreation space and other areas provided as common open
space, including land dedicated to public use except required street rights of
way.
      (2)   Open space area. Area included in the calculation of residential
density shall include open space or public use, arranged and restricted by
easement, covenant deed or dedication and not included in the minimum yard
space required for dwellings or used to provide the required off-street parking

use, recreational facilities and other common use shall be held in corporate
ownership by the owners of the project area building sites and the developer
shall incorporate into the protective covenants and/or deed restrictions, a
clause giving an interest in such land to each owner who buys property within
the development. Property owners shall be given due notice as to their
responsibilities for the care and maintenance of open space, including the
manner in which charges and/or assessments are to be made. Property owners
shall also be advised of their responsibility in the event of a default of the
property owners' association with respect to the proper maintenance of the open
space.
      (6)   Ownership by public agency. As an alternate to a property owners'
association the developer may deed the land to a public agency, subject to its
legal acceptance and agreement to maintain the open space in lieu of a property
owners' association. Dedication of such land shall convey a clear and
unencumbered title to the public agency.
      (7)   Lot widths; setbacks. Lot widths and setbacks may be varied due to
the variety of structural designs, but in no case shall a structure be closer
to the street or public way than twenty-five feet. If lot widths for single-
family or two-family residential lots are varied by the developer, he shall
enter into an agreement with the Municipality that the property owners within a
planned unit development of this nature shall be assessed equally for any
improvements which may be by assessment, rather than by a front footage basis.
      (8)   Commercial use. Commercial uses such as are permitted in a "B-2"
Neighborhood Business District, may be included in a planned unit development
for residences provided they form a small commercial center to primarily serve
the planned unit development.
   (b)   "B" Districts. In "B" Districts, a planned unit development may be
permitted in accordance with the following provisions if the Planning
Commission is satisfied: that the proponents of the development are financially
able to carry out the proposed project; that they intend to start construction
within one year of the approval of the project and necessary change in zoning;
and that they intend to complete it within a reasonable time as determined by
the Commission.
      (1)   Commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with
thoroughfares. In planning these groups of buildings or establishments, no yard
space will be required between uses within the groups; however, the yard
requirements must be observed at the edge of the complete development. Planting
screens or fences as provided elsewhere in this ordinance shall be required.
      (2)   Off-street parking and loading requirements shall be observed as
required. Group parking facilities shall provide spaces equal to the number of
spaces required for each use to be developed.
      (3)   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the developer as well as from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding existing or potential developments.
      (4)   The ground area occupied by all the buildings shall not exceed in
the aggregate twenty-five percent (25%) of the total area of the lot or tract.
   (c)   "M" Districts. In "M" Districts, a planned unit development may be
permitted in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in park like
surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen
lighting, parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw
materials or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony
of buildings and a compact grouping or groupings in order to economize in the
provisions of such utility services as are required. Thoroughfares shall be
kept to a minimum throughout a planned industrial area in order that those
thoroughfares which are constructed may be built to the highest possible
standards.
      (2)   Certain types of commercial uses, such as a restaurant, central
secretarial or stenographic pool, or other business service type uses, repair
services, or clinics as may form a small commercial center to serve the needs
of the industries or their personnel, may be permitted in a planned industrial
area.
      (3)   Off-street parking and loading areas shall conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, and all screening requirements shall be
observed.
      (4)   No building shall be less than seventy-five feet distant from any
boundary of the tract on which the office, research or industrial development
is located. All intervening spaces between the street pavement and the right-
of-way line and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and
improved areas shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly
maintained at all times.

   It is the intent and purpose of this section to regulate the time, place and
manner in which limited video lottery and Keno is presented to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Point
Pleasant, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of limited video lottery and Keno within
the City of Point Pleasant and not to prohibit the limited video lottery and
Keno industry. (12-14-04)
1347.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.

either hold or apply for, and receive, a liquor license before being granted a
limited video lottery license to a particular individual or business location.
   (b)   Current West Virginia law governing limited video lottery/Keno
establishments does not limit the number of limited video lottery/Keno
establishments that may be licensed.
   (c)   There is considerable and growing local and statewide concern with
many effects of limited video lottery establishments including, but not limited
to: influence upon children, increased criminal activity associated with bars/
night clubs, including liquor law violations, violent crimes against persons,
and property crimes.
   (d)   There is dilatory effect on property values and neighborhoods in the
vicinity of the land use and it is a legitimate concern of the City to protect
the property values of those in residential districts from encroaching
commercial activity.

establishments shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures, from the closest exterior structural wall of each
business. The distance between any limited video lottery and/or Keno
establishment and any religious institution, school or child care center shall
be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from
the closest property line of the limited video lottery and/or Keno
establishment to the closest property line of the religious institution, school
or child care center.
(12-14-04)
1347.05 NOT A NONCONFORMING USE; REGULATION AFTER CEASING OPERATION.
   A limited video lottery and/or Keno establishment lawfully operating is not
rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a religious
institution, school, child care center, public park or change in property
zoning designation; however, if a licensed limited video lottery and/or Keno
establishment ceases operation for a period of 180 days or more regardless of
any intent to resume operation, it may not recommence operation in that
location.
(12-14-04)
1347.06 EXISTING ESTABLISHMENTS NOT EXEMPT; DAMAGE AND REPLACEMENT.

(effective date of the adoption of this Ordinance 12-14-04) are not exempt from
these requirements. If the structure housing an existing limited video lottery
and/or Keno establishment becomes damaged or destroyed by any cause, the
structure may be replaced or reconstructed as long as action to reestablish the
facility is initiated within 180 days.

1349.01 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Point Pleasant’s
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities. The City of Point Pleasant finds that Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities may pose significant concerns to the health,
safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its
inhabitants. The City also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the City
and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to insure
that the placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities is consistent with the City’s land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this article is to minimize
impact of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities,
and protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Point Pleasant. (10-

   (b)   In exercising its powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or

   When an appeal from the decision of the Zoning Officer has been taken and
filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all proceedings and work on the
premises concerning which the decision was made shall be stayed unless the

1353.09 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   In determining the acceptability of a conditional use, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be guided by the applicable standards set forth under the
specific heading given in this Zoning Ordinance and as follows:
      (1)   The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that
it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (2)   The proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and
pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved,
taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of
traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight
distances, location and access of off-street parking and provisions for
pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to minimizing child-vehicle
contacts in residential districts.
      (3)   The proposed use will not overload public utilities and facilities.
      (4)   The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation
of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible nuisance
emanating therefrom which might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby
permitted uses, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or
lights.
      (5)   The location and height of buildings or structures and the
location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed
use will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use
of adjacent land or buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
   (b)   As a condition of its approval, the Board may impose standards deemed
necessary to accomplish the purpose of this ordinance.
   (c)   Sufficient advance notice shall be given to the Planning Commission in
order that such Commission may have the opportunity to report thereon to the
Board before a conditional use is approved.
1353.10 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as may be
recorded, differs substantially from the street and lot lines as shown on the
Zoning Map, the Zoning Officer shall request an interpretation of the Zoning
Map. The Board of Zoning Appeals, after notice to the owner or owners of the
property or properties concerned, and after public hearing, shall interpret the
Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Ordinance. In case of any question as to the location of any boundary line
between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the Zoning Map may be
made to the Board by affected persons or the Zoning Officer and a determination
shall be made by the Board.
1353.11 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power upon appeal in specific
cases, filed as hereinbefore provided, to authorize such variance from the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance so that the spirit and purpose of this Ordinance
shall be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance, the
Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and
other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the
interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this Ordinance and in the public
interest. In authorizing a variance, with attached conditions, the Board shall
require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary, that the
conditions attached are being and will be complied with. No variance in the
provisions or requirements of this Ordinance shall be authorized by the Board
unless the Board finds, beyond reasonable doubt, that all the following facts
and conditions exist:
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
1353.12 NONCONFORMING USE.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to grant an extension
or permit completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use upon a lot
occupied by such building, or on a lot adjoining, provided that such lot was
under the same ownership as the lot in question on the date such building
became nonconforming, and where such extension is necessary and incidental to
the existing use of such building; provided, however, that the floor area of
such extension shall not exceed in all one hundred percent (100%) of the floor
area of the existing building or buildings devoted to a nonconforming use and
provided further that such extension or extensions shall be undertaken within
five years of the date when the use of such building became nonconforming.

      (5)   Administration.
         A.   The Water Purveyor will operate a cross-connection control
program, to include the keeping of necessary records, which fulfills the
requirements of the WVBPH Cross-Connections and Backflow Prevention
Regulations.
         B.   The Owner shall allow his property to be inspected for possible
cross-connections and shall follow the provisions of the Water Purveyor’s
program and the WVBPH Regulations if a cross- connection is permitted.
         C.   If the Water Purveyor requires that the public supply be
protected by containment, the Owner shall be responsible for water quality
beyond the outlet end of the containment device and should utilize fixture
outlet protection for that purpose. He may utilize local public health
officials, or personnel from the Water Purveyor, or their designated
representatives, to assist him in the survey of his facilities and to assist
him in the selection of proper fixture outlet devices, and the proper
installation of these devices.
      (6)   Requirements.
         A.   Water Purveyor.
            1.   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide on- site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing.
            2.   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed
necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the
correction to be made. Ordinarily ninety (90) days will be allowed. However,
this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved
and the history of the device(s) in questions.
            3.   The Water Purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to
remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
            4.   The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The Purveyor will
allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the
Owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second
re- inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the
water service to the Owner’s premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event that the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
            5.   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious
threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated
immediately.
            6.   The Purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial focus will be on
high hazard industries and commercial premises.
         B.   Owner.
            1.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or
protection of all cross-connections on his premises.
            2.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the
Water Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have
tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
            3.   The Owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow
preventer which is revealed by periodic testing.
            4.   The Owner shall inform the Purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross- connections of which
the Owner is aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.   
            5.   The Owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.   
            6.   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner
approved by the Water Purveyor.
            7.   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by
the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
            8.   Any owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system.
            9.   In the event the Owner install plumbing to provide potable
water for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor’s side of the
backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer
installed.
            10.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees
for permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that
the device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-
compliance with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
      (7)   Degree of hazard. The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be
classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved
backflow prevention device.
      (8)   Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to continue in service unless
the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
device is present.
      (9)   Periodic testing.
         A.   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at
least annually.
         B.   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the owner’s expense.
         C.   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner’s expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires
such continuity.
         D.   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
is specified in A. above, in cases where there is a history of test failures
and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved,
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by
the owner.
      (10)   Records. The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain the
following:
         A.   Master files on customer cross-connections.
         B.   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or
inspections
         C.   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH.
Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspections, surveys,
tests or corrective actions to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

A person who in any capacity for compensation, other than as an employee of
another, undertakes, offers to undertake, purports to have the capacity to
undertake. or submits a bid to construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from,
improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad,
structure or excavation associated with a project, development or improvement,
or to do any part thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other
structures or works in connection therewith, where the cost of the undertaking
is one thousand dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who
performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.
Contractor does not include:
      (1)    One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without fabricating
or consuming them in the construction project.
      (2)    A person who personally performs construction work on the site of
real property which the person owns or leases whether for commercial or
residential purposes;
      (3)    A person who is licensed or registered as a professional and who

Critical Facility
Any facility in which, even a slight chance of flooding is too great a threat.
Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations, police stations,
storage of critical records, and similar facilities. These should be given
special consideration when formulating regulatory alternatives and floodplain
management plans. A critical facility should not be located in a special flood
hazard area if at all possible. If a critical facility must be located in a
special flood hazard area it should be provided a higher level of protection so
that it can continue to function and provide services during a flood.
Development
Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Flood
A general and temporary inundation of normally dry land areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
The official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones
applicable to the City of Point Pleasant. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
Flood Insurance Study
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
provided flood profiles, floodway information, and water surface elevations.
Floodplain
      (1)    A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation;
      (2)    An area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of
surface waters from any source.
Floodway
The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land area that
must be reserved to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
Flood proofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes
of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for unknown factors
that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights of any given flood and
floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at stream crossings, and
increased runoff from urbanization of the watershed. Freeboarcl also tends to
lower the cost of flood insurance.
Highest Adjacent Grade (HAG)
The highest natural elevation of the ground surface immediately adjacent to the
development or structure foundation. This is primarily used during insurance
rating in approximated floodplains.
Historic Structure
Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for incliviclual
listing on the National Register;

engage in the practice of land surveying as defined in WV state code.
Lowest Adjacent Grade (LAG)
The lowest natural elevation of the ground surface immediately adjacent to the
proposed development or structure foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to
determine whether the structure is located within a special flood hazard area
by comparing it to the base flood elevation.
Lowest Floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An
unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant materials as defined in
FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a

of this ordinance, or, if full compliance is not possible, to reduce the
adverse impacts of the non-compliance to the greatest extent feasible.
Reasonably Safe from Flooding
Means that during the base flood, water should not damage structures and any
subsurface waters related to the base flood should not damage existing or
proposed structures.
Special Flood Hazard Area
The land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, Al-30, and A99. This term shall also
include areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or
otherwise described in this ordinance.
Start of Construction

repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

manmade, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of their size, through
which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its volume.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to it's before damage condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the
cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or
exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
Substantial Improvement
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
ordinance
requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
Top of Bank
The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a stream indicate
the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar with flu vial
geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional is not
employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
fifty (50) feet of relatively flat land.
Violation
The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant with all the
requirements of this ordinance. Any structure or other development lacking the
certifications, finished construction elevation certificate or other evidence
of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
(Ord. 8-12-13)
1721.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Point Pleasant which are subject to the one hundred (100) year
flood, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Point Pleasant by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 12/03/2013 or the most recent
revision thereof including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Point Pleasant by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall consist of the
following four specific areas:
         A.   The Floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
         B.   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
         C.   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100- year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
         D.   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an
A zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Point Pleasant where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Point Pleasant's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Point Pleasant shall notify the NFIP
Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Point Pleasant may identify and regulate new local
flood hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood
Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate
study methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Point Pleasant. The burden
of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
 
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.  Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either; 1. The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or 2. The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the City
of Point Pleasant in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall
then be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction
provisions of this ordinance.
         (Ord. 8-12-13)
1721.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the City of Point Pleasant during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
The resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed
by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic
terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Point Pleasant, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the one percent (1%) annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE Without Floodway.  Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine; l. The amount being invested and, 2. The
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   Any development and/or use of land shall he permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Point Pleasant, The Floodplain Administrator, the
State Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property
owners of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of
the stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the
local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval..
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Point Pleasant in
writing that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of the stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of
stream will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream
segment. If hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be
undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Point Pleasant a
legal agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be
performed on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and
other stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the
watercourse alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and
provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.03(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         (Ord. 8-12-13)
1721.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General. Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other special

review shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the
work is of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including
materials and labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the
estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,

sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared
by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications.
The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question,
together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit
conditions.
         G.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the City of Point Pleasant determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are five (5) feet high or more). This
agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this ordinance.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on
dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in (I) above, stating that the finished structure, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      The location of the flood way boundary shall be represented on the plan
when a floodway is present on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
      (2)   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having smfaces not lower than
one (1) foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 8-12-13)

and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
            3.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home
Placement requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in
this ordinance.
      (5)   Fill. The City of Point Pleasant officially recognizes the
beneficial functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of
water during floods. Therefore;
         A.   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
         B.   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
         C.   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
         D.   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1721.04 (a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
            1.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Point Pleasant may require
the applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill
would not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Point Pleasant During permit review the City of
Point Pleasant shall consider the following issues that have the potential to
cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
               a.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
               b.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
               c.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures.
               d.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
               e.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
            2.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
            3.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid
ponding)
            4.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
            5.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
            6.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
            7.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one ( l) vertical on two
(2) horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are
submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
            8.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
               a.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of five (5) feet per second
or less will be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines,
weeds, or similar vegetative undergrowth.
               b.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five (5)
feet per second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or
rock slope protection.
            9.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area
shall obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLO MR) from FEMA when
directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be
issued. After fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a
Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of
compliance can be issued.
            10.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development.
         A.   All structures and other development shall be constructed or
placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water
and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and
height of floodwater.
            1.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
            2.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or fifty (50) feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from
the top of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation
shall be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along
the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall
be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.               
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.
         A.   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
         B.   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.

to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Point Pleasant official that (i) the issuance of a
decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such
construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in subsection (b)(2)D. of this section; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency

requirements or provisions of this ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the City of Point Pleasant,
shall be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Point Pleasant of not less than fifty dollars
($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution.
In default of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to
exceed ten (10) days. Each day during which any violation of this ordinance
continues shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above
penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity
for the proper enforcement of this ordinance. The imposition of a fine or
penalty for any violation of, or non-compliance with, this ordinance shall not
excuse the violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to
continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such
violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance
with this ordinance may be declared by the Town Council of the City of Point

1731.03 REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Owners of vacant and or abandoned building(s) shall register such

notices or registration statements as herein authorized and in connection
herewith;
         H.   Registration shall be required for all vacant and/or abandoned
buildings which have been vacant and/or abandoned for thirty (30) consecutive
days or more;
         I.   In no instance shall the registration of a vacant and/or
abandoned building(s) and the payment of a registration fee be construed to
exonerate the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other
building code, housing code, or ordinance requirement;
         J.   One registration statement may be filed to include all vacant
and/or abandoned buildings of the registering owner, but each building
constitutes a separate fee;
         K.   Owners of a building(s) vacant and/or abandoned for one (1) year

Inspections may also be made to determine the occupancy or vacancy of said
structure. If an internal inspection is deemed necessary, the owner shall allow
access. If access is denied or if owner fails to arrange for the inspection,
the City will seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction.
Said inspection shall determine the structural integrity of the building, the
repairs necessary to insure its structural integrity, and the safety of
entering the building by firefighters or police officers in time of emergency,
and the presence or lack of a fire hazard.    
      (4)   In the event, the building's structural integrity appears to be
questionable, the aforesaid City Enforcement Committee shall have the authority
to require that the property owner provide a professional opinion from a
qualified architect or structural engineer to determine the building's
integrity and the repairs necessary to ensure its safety to the public.
Furthermore, the aforesaid City Enforcement Committee shall have the authority
to issue orders to the owner(s) for necessary corrective action(s).
      (5)   All vacant and /or abandoned buildings are subject to re-inspection
on an annual basis or as deemed necessary.
   (b)   It is the intent of this article that, through a registration and
inspection process, and other improved public safety efforts, vacant and/or
abandoned buildings will be kept weathertight and secure from trespassers, will
provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency,
will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding properties, and will not otherwise present a public hazard.   
   (c)   The owner of the vacant and/or abandoned building(s) shall register
said building(s) with the City and shall maintain it so that the building(s)
does not fall into disrepair and thus does not warrant a complaint.
   (d)   The City shall assess the effects of the condition of those buildings
on nearby structures and shall promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate and
develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (e)   Further, the exterior property's areas are to be mowed regularly and
non-cultivated gardens maintained. All noxious weeds are prohibited.
