EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Ripley Codified Ordinances was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Ripley Codified Ordinances is indicated.

Charter of the City of Ripley
   Pursuant to W.V. Code 8-4-8 and Ordinance enacted on October 20, 1998, the
Common Council of the City of Ripley hereby submits proposed amendments to the
entire special legislative charter of the City of Ripley, enacted in 1867 by
the Legislature of West Virginia, to entirely supplant and supersede the
existing Charter of the City of Ripley:

      B.   All areas annexed thereto since 1867.
   2.   The municipal authorities of said City shall be a Mayor, Recorder and

   Beginning with the election of June 2011, persons elected to all five seats

      The City of Ripley is hereby granted all of the rights and privileges,
and imposed with all of the duties required of, municipalities by the Code of
the State of West Virginia; provided, that where a provision of this Charter is
inconsistent with the Code of the State of West Virginia, and such
inconsistency is expressly permitted by the Code of the State of West Virginia,
then the provisions of this Charter shall control.
   4.   There shall be a Police Chief, a Municipal Court Judge, and Municipal
Attorney appointed by the Mayor, by and with the consent of Council, to

by law, or as may be required by said Council.
   5.   Elections of Mayor, Recorder and Council persons of the City of Ripley
shall be in accordance with the general law relating to elections, as set forth
in the Code of the State of West Virginia, except as otherwise provided in this

their officer respectively. The Mayor, having taken such oath or affirmation,
may administer the oaths aforesaid to the other officers and Council persons.
Certificates of said oaths or affirmation shall be recorded in the journal of
the proceedings of the Council.
(WV Code 8-5-8)
   7.   If any person elected Mayor, Recorder or as a member of Council shall
not have been eligible or fail or refuse to take the oath or affirmation
required by this act, within the 20 days aforesaid, or shall die or remove from
said City, such office shall be declared vacant, and the vacancy filled as
provided by law, but in all cases from the citizens of the City eligible to
such office under this act.
   8.   The Council shall be presided over at its meetings by the Mayor, or in
the Mayor’s absence by one of the Council persons chosen by a majority of the
Council present, and a majority of the Council shall be necessary to constitute
a quorum to do business. The Council shall cause to be kept, in a well-bound
book, an accurate account of its proceedings, ordinances, bylaws, acts, rules,
regulations and orders, which shall be fully indexed and open to inspection by
anyone who is required to pay taxes to the Municipality. The proceedings of the
last meeting shall be made available to Council, corrected when necessary, and
signed by the person presiding for the time being. Upon the call of any member,
the ayes and noes on any question shall be called and recorded in the journal.
   No member of the governing body shall vote upon any ordinance, order,
measure, resolution or proposition in which he or she may be interested other

breaking vote, unless he or she has previously voted.
(Code 8-9-2)

provided by the Code of the State of West Virginia.

upon the said City or its Council, expressly or by implication, by the Code of
the State of West Virginia, the Council shall have power to adopt and enforce
all needful orders, by-laws and ordinances not contrary to the Constitution and
laws of this State, and to, prescribe, impose and enforce reasonable fines and
penalties, including imprisonment for such terms as may be provided by law,
under the judgment and order of the Mayor, or the person lawfully exercising
the powers of a municipal judge.
   11.   The Mayor shall be the Chief Executive Officer of said City; shall
take care that the by-laws, ordinances and orders of the Council are faithfully
executed; shall see that peace and good order are preserved, and that persons
and property are protected in the City, and may appoint special police officers
for that purpose when deemed to be necessary by the Mayor; shall receive a
compensation for services, to be fixed by the Council, which shall not be
increased or diminished for the term for which the Mayor was elected.

and have charge of and preserve the records of the City, and shall receive a

diminished for the term for which the Recorder was elected.

who shall pay out the same upon the order of the Mayor countersigned by the
record, and not otherwise.
   14.   All rights, privileges and properties of the said City heretofore
acquired by any act now in force, shall continue and remain vested in said City
by this Charter. This Charter shall supersede all other charters hereinbefore
lawfully enacted.

   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified

   Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, as used in this article:
   (a)   “Accused officer” means any police officer who is the subject of an
investigation or interrogation which results in a recommendation of punitive
action against him or her.
   (b)   “Hearing” means any meeting in the course of an investigatory
proceeding, other than an interrogation at which no testimony is taken under
oath, conducted by a hearing board for the purpose of taking or inducing
testimony or receiving evidence.
   (c)   “Hearing Board” means a board appointed to hold a hearing on a
complaint against an accused officer. The hearing Board shall consist of three
members to be appointed pursuant to subsection (c)(1) hereof. Hearing Board
members appointed under subsection (c)(1) hereof may be removed from office as
provided under subsection (c)(2) hereof.
      (1)   The Hearing Board shall be a standing hearing board. The department
chief shall appoint the first member, the local fraternal order of police shall
appoint the second member, and the local chamber of commerce or local
businessmen’s association shall appoint the third member. If there is no local
fraternal order of police, the state fraternal order of police shall appoint
the second member. If there is no local chamber of commerce or local
businessmen’s association, the first and second members shall appoint the third
member by agreement. Of the three original appointments in each police
department, the first member shall serve for six years from the date of his or
her appointment; the second member shall serve four years from the date of his
or her appointment; and the third member shall serve for two years from the
date of his or her appointment. After the original appointments, all
appointments shall be made for periods of four years each by the designated
appointing authority. In the event that any member shall cease to be a member
due to death, resignation, final removal or other cause, a new member shall be
appointed within thirty days of the date the ex-member ceased to be a member.
This appointment shall be made by the officer or body who in the first instance
appointed the member who is no longer a member. When the hearing board is
appointed, the three members shall elect one of their number to act as
president of the board, who shall serve as president for one year. In the event
that a member has had a part in the investigation or interrogation of an
accused officer or is related by consanguinity or affinity to an accused
officer, that member shall be recused from participation in the accused
officer’s hearing. In such an instance, the officer or body who in the first
instance appointed the recused member shall appoint another person for sole
purpose of the accused officer’s hearing. No member shall hold any other office
(other than the office of notary public) under the United States, this state,
or any municipality, county or other political subdivision thereof; nor shall
any member serve on any political committee or take any active part in the
management of any political campaign.

of the Hearing Board. However, within ten days of removing any member, the
Mayor shall file in the Circuit Clerk’s office of the county in which the
Municipality is located a petition setting forth in full the reason for the
removal and seeking the circuit court’s confirmation of the Mayor’s removal of
the member. The Mayor shall file a copy of the petition with the removed member
at the same time it is filed with the Circuit Clerk. The petition shall have
precedence on the Circuit Court’s docket and shall be heard as soon as
practicable on the request of the removed member. All rights vested in a
circuit court by this subsection may be exercised by the judge thereof in
vacation. In the event that no term of the circuit court is being held at the
time the petition is filed, and the judge thereof cannot be reached in the
county in which the petition was filed, the petition shall be heard at the next
succeeding circuit court term, whether regular or special, and the removed
member shall remain removed until a hearing is held on the petition. The court
or the judge thereof in vacation shall hear and decide the issues presented by
the petition. The party affected adversely by the court’s or judge’s decision
shall have the right to petition the Supreme Court of Appeals for a review of
the decision as in other civil cases. If the Mayor fails to file the petition
with the Circuit Clerk’s office within ten days as provided above, the removed
member shall immediately resume his or her position as a Hearing Board member.
Any resident of the Municipality shall have the right at any time to seek the
removal of any Hearing Board member. To do so, the resident shall file a
petition in the Circuit Clerk’s office of the county where the Municipality is
located. The resident shall also serve a copy of the petition on the member
sought to be removed. The petition shall be matured for hearing and heard by
the circuit court or the judge thereof in vacation in the same manner as civil
proceedings in the Circuit Courts of this State are heard. Any party adversely
affected by the Circuit Court’s or judge’s decision shall have the right to
petition the Supreme Court of Appeals for a review of the decision as in other
civil cases.

an interrogation focuses on matters which are likely to result in punitive
action against any police officer, then that officer shall have the right to be
represented by counsel who may be present at all times during such
interrogation.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the immediate temporary suspension, pending an
investigation, from duty of any police officer who reports for duty under the

from performing his duties or under the influence of an apparent mental or
emotional disorder.

149.34 SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (a)   Rationale. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states in its
“Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex” that sexual harassment is an
unlawful employment practice. The purpose of this policy is to unequivocally
set forth the City’s position regarding sexual harassment and the procedures to
be implemented in order to carry out this policy. The City considers the
respectful treatment of all employees to include the absence of sexual
harassment from the work place.
 
   (b)   Definition. “Sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive work environment. For example, the posting or display of materials of
a sexual nature may create an offensive work environment.
   The City’s employees are prohibited from engaging in any of the conduct
described above.
 
   (c)   Policy. Our continuing policy is to provide employees a workplace free
from any form of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment in any manner or form is
expressly prohibited. All claims of sexual harassment will be promptly and
thoroughly investigated and corrective action taken if warranted by the results
of the investigation. Such action may include disciplinary measures up to and
including immediate termination.
 
   (d)   Procedures.
      (1)   An employee who feels that he or she has been subjected to sexual
harassment should report the incident immediately in writing to his/her
department head.
      (2)   Complaints will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.
Investigations will be designed to protect the reasonable privacy interests of
all parties concerned. Disciplinary and corrective actions will be taken
dependent upon the circumstances and as appropriate.
      (3)   If the complaint involves your department head, the incident should
be reported directly to the Mayor.

149.35 PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES HANDBOOK.
   The City of Ripley Employee Handbook, dated January 2009 is hereby adopted
and enacted as an ordinance of the City.
(12-2-08)
 
149.36 ANNUAL INCREMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to ensure uniform adherence to
the established procedures for compensating eligible employees of the City for
an annual increment.
 
   (b)   Definitions.  
      (1)   “Eligible employee” means any permanent employee of the City
including any probationary or provisional employee having prior qualifying
service, whose position requires 12 months service per year, and who is
eligible to receive the same benefits as other permanent employees. Employees
who work less than full-time are not eligible to receive years of service
credit for such employment.
      (2)   “Full years of service” means full years of total service as an
employee of the City of Ripley (1 year equals 12 months).
         A.   Employment of less than full-time shall not be counted when
computing full years of service.
         B.   This excludes any time during the year that an employee is off
the payroll in no-pay status for unauthorized leave, leave of absence
(personal, medical, or parental), Workers’ Compensation temporary total
disability benefits, or suspension.
         C.   When a provisional appointee attains permanent status and the
City elects to include such employment in the probationary period, the
provisional appointment tenure shall be included in the years of service
calculation.
 
   (c)   Policy.  
      (1)   Effective the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1997, every eligible
employee with three or more full years of service shall receive an annual
salary increment equal to $50.00 times the employee’s years of service, not to
exceed 20 years of service.
         A.   Subsequent to July 1, 1998 and in each fiscal year thereafter,
all eligible employees shall receive an annual increment increase of $50.00
times the employee’s full years of service.
         B.   New employees becoming eligible as a result of meeting the 3 year
service minimum requirement shall be entitled to the annual increment increase
equal to $150.00 dollars. They shall receive a single annual increment
thereafter of an additional $50.00 for each subsequent fiscal year up to the
maximum of 20 full years of service (not to exceed $1,000 per year).
         C.   An increment increase shall not be paid to an employee until the
employee has met the eligibility factors and after his/her services have been
rendered to the City.
         D.   Increment increases shall be in addition to any across-the-board,
cost-of-living, or percentage salary increases which may be granted in any
fiscal year.
         E.   The increment increase shall not replace any other financial
rewards or incentives as voted on by Council.
         F.   An eligible employee who is or has been on a leave of absence
without pay during a fiscal year shall be paid concurrently with all other
eligible City employees a pro rata share for the portion of time for which he/
she worked regardless of whether or not the employee has returned to duty at
the time the annual increment is paid.
Example: If an employee had 10 years’ service, he would be entitled to an
annual increment of $500.00 (10 years x $50.00/year increment), as if he were
being paid a salary of $500.00 per year. If that employee did not work (i.e.
was in a no pay status) for 6 months in one year, he would not be entitled to a
full year’s salary. Therefore, he would only be entitled to one-half of the
$500.00 increment, or $250.00 for 6 months he actually worked.
         G.   When an employee with 3 or more years of previous service is re-
employed during a fiscal year, the employee is eligible to receive a pro rata
payment for the portion of time worked during the fiscal year following
reemployment. However, if the employee returns during the same year that he had
been paid a pro rata increment increase upon termination, he will only be
eligible for the pro rata portion for the part of the year that he was on the
payroll subsequent to his reemployment.
      (2)   The annual increment shall be paid on a pro rata basis for the
portion of service rendered by the employee during the current year of
employment.
         A.   Such service period shall include the tenure value of any and all
accrued terminal leave regardless of the method elected for payment of the
leave, i.e., lump sum payment or election to remain on the payroll.
         B.   The pro rata portion an employee receives upon separation prior
to June 30, shall be based on his total full years of service, and shall be
computed based on the months of service rendered in the year in which the
employee terminates.
Example: An employee has 19 years and 6 months of qualifying City Service as of
June 30 and receives an increment in the gross amount of $950.00, This employee
later resigns effective December 31. At the time of his resignation, he is
eligible to receive a pro rated increment for the 6 months he worked in the
current fiscal year. Although the employee’s totaled eligible City service now
equals 20 years, he worked for only 6 months of the current fiscal year and is
eligible to receive an increment in the gross amount of $500.00.
•   Total full years of City Service (20) x $50.00 per year = Annual Increment
Entitlement ($1000).
•   Annual Increment Entitlement ($1000) divided by 12= Monthly Rate of
Entitlement ($83.333).
•   Monthly Rate of Entitlement ($83.333) x Months Worked in the Fiscal Year (6
mos.) = Annual Increment ($500.00)
         C.   Employee entitlement to the annual increment compensation is
expressly subject to and contingent on, an annual determination by Council for
each fiscal year that adequate and sufficient moneys are available to fund the
annual increment compensation policy and appropriates the moneys necessary to
pay the annual increment compensation. In the event such determination and
appropriation is not made for any year, no entitlement to such annual increment
compensation shall vest in any employee or be payable at anytime by the City.
      (3)   The employee is responsible for obtaining verification of
qualifying service and such service must be verified from each former employer.
The verification shall specify if the service was full-time or a portion
thereof.
      (4)   In accordance with the U.S. Department of Labor ruling of August
26, 1985, the increment increase payments shall only be included when computing
the determined rate of pay for overtime payment for employees working in excess
of 40 hours in any workweek.
      (5)   The increment pay shall be included when determining an employee’s
daily rate to be reported to the Bureau of Employment Programs, and the
Workers’ Compensation Division.
      (6)   The increment pay shall be included in an employee’s reportable
income for Unemployment Compensation benefits.
      (7)   Compensation entitlement shall not be construed to mandate an
increase in the salary of any elected City official.

provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.

313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may

         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
 333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.

secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the

time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or
attempts to exercise, these privileges at a time when the vehicle is not being
used for the loading or unloading of a person with a mobility impairment is
guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon first conviction thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty, he

registration plate or removable windshield placard may not stop, stand or park
a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.

designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty

   (j)   Parking enforcement personnel who otherwise enforce parking violations
may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (k)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

present danger; that said abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles and
certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve as harborage and
breeding places for rodents, insects and pests injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare; that the accumulation and storage of any of such
items or parts thereof on private or public property, including but not limited

eliminate the unsightly practice of abandoning motor vehicles and certain
abandoned or inoperative household appliances. In view of these findings, the

the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles and certain
abandoned household appliances. The City further finds and declares that the
presence of an abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, or an abandoned

to respond to the medical needs of a family member of the juvenile regardless
of whether the juvenile’s action is taken in order to prevent death or serious

any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the City during

of Police, or his designee, either for a regulation as provided in subsection
(d)(12) hereof or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the
findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent
warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile, and by a parent or
guardian of the juvenile, if feasible, stating:
         A.   The name, age, and address of the juvenile;
         B.   The name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof;
         C.   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other
physical characteristics of the juvenile;

   The Chief of Police or his designee may grant a permit in writing for the
juvenile’s use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the Chief
of Police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purpose of this
section.
      (12)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Chief of Police or

as set forth in subsection (d)(11) hereof but adapted to reasonably necessary
nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Chief of
Police or his designee permitting use of public places should be issued
sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and
through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the
scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved
not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the

necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this section.

officer shall ask the apparent offender’s age and reason for being in the
public place or establishment during the restricted hours.
      (2)   The officer shall not prepare a juvenile arrest report, issue a
citation, or make an arrest under this section unless the officer reasonably
believes that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other
circumstances, no exception or defense in subsection (d) or (e) hereof is
present.
   (g)   Penalties:
      (1)   A juvenile who violates any provision of this section is subject to

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable
detention shall not constitute an arrest nor shall it render the owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, liable to the person detained.

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

lock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system which was
manufactured on or before 1898;

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent

office is located in Ripley. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
when the taxpayer has only one (1) office location and this office is located

in West Virginia are neither taxed nor taxable by another municipality, the
gross income or gross proceeds from those activities are taxable by the City of
Ripley.
   Persons domiciled outside the City limits of Ripley who solicit sales within
Ripley and sell tangible personal property are doing business in Ripley,
irrespective of the domicile of such persons irrespective of whether or not
such persons maintain a permanent place of business in Ripley and irrespective
of how a sales order is transmitted or processed. If an order is placed in
connection with solicitation by a representative (regardless whether there is

      (6-1-04)
   (b)    Natural gas companies, one and four-fifths percent (1.80%) on the

one-fifth percent (1.20%).

business. (3-2-04)
727.14 CONTRACTING.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in the business of
contracting, the tax shall be equal to one and one-fifth percent (1.20%) of the
gross income of the business. (3-2-04)
   727.14. 1 Form of Contract.
   Persons engaged in the contracting business shall report the entire gross
income under the contracting classification, regardless of whether the contract
is a turnkey contract, lump sum contract, per unit contract, cost plus fixed
fee contract, or other contract having a similar basis. Gross income received
from contracting activity must be reported under the contracting classification
and the manner of performance, basis of determining cost, fee or income or form
of contract shall not alter the definition of contractor or of contracting and
shall not change the taxability of such income from the contracting
classification to another classification. A contracting activity remains a
contracting activity regardless of what the parties may name it and regardless
of the manner in which the parties may make payment and perform work.
 
   727.14.2 Costs.
   The measure of the tax under the contracting classification is gross income
and includes all items of cost where the contractor has incurred liability. The
cost of materials and labor can only be exempted from the measure of the tax in
those cases where the contractor is not liable to vendors or workmen for
payment. In those cases where the contractor contends that he/she has not
incurred a municipal business and occupation tax liability because he/she acted
solely as an agent for the owner, the burden of proving alleged principal-
agency relationship shall be upon the contractor.
 
   727.14.3 Separate contracts for labor and materials.
   In cases where the contractor enters into a separate contract for the
furnishing of materials by the contractor and a separate contract for erection
of such materials by the contractor, the gross income from both contracts is
taxable under the contracting classification, unless it can be proved by the
contractor that passage of title of the materials was not dependent upon the
erection of the materials by the contractor and that the sale of such materials
is, in fact, a separate and distinct transaction, taxable under the municipal
business and occupation tax law, as a retail or wholesale sale, as the case may
be. The contract to furnish materials shall not be considered a separate and
distinct transaction from the contract to erect the same, unless it is
established by the contractor to be a complete arm's length transaction with no
dependency existing between the contract for materials and the contract for
erection. The burden of proving any alleged arm's length transaction shall be
upon the contractor.
 
   727.14.4 Separate Purchase Orders.
   A separate purchase order for the furnishing of work or labor and a separate
purchase order for the furnishing of materials which constitutes the contract
(s) between the parties shall be treated in the same manner as set forth in the
paragraph above.
 
   727.14.5 Prime and Subcontractors.
   A prime contractor, one who furnishes work or both materials and work under
a written or oral contract, for the construction, alteration, repair,
decoration or improvement of a new or existing building or structure or any
part thereof, or for the alteration, improvement or development of realty, must
report his/her gross income under the contracting classification without any
deduction on account of any expenses incurred. If the prime contractor executes
a contract with another for a portion of the job or project the prime
contractor receives no deduction from gross income on account of any payment
made to the subcontractor. The subcontractor will also be taxed on his/her
gross income under the contracting classification.
 
   727.14.6 Contract entered into with Government.
   Gross income received by a person for contracting activities performed for
the State of West Virginia, the federal government or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies, boards, commissions or political subdivisions,
etc., or performed for nonprofit organizations is taxable and shall be reported
under the contracting classification. The fact that the owner is a governmental
unit or a nonprofit organization does not relieve the contractor,
subcontractor, supplier or any other person from liability for municipal
business and occupation tax on the full amount of gross income.
727.15  OTHER BUSINESSES OR SERVICES NOT OTHERWISE TAXED.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in any service
business or calling not otherwise specifically taxed under this law, there is
hereby levied and shall be collected a tax equal to three-fifths of one percent
(.60%) of the gross income of any such business.
   Gross income or gross proceeds of sales derived from services within West
Virginia which is not taxed or taxable by any other municipality are included
in the measure of Ripley business and occupation tax if the services are either
directed from a Ripley location or the taxpayer's principal West Virginia
office is located in Ripley. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
when a taxpayer has only one (1) office location and this office is located
within the municipal limits of the City of Ripley and its activities elsewhere
in West Virginia are neither taxed nor taxable by another municipality, the
gross income or gross proceeds from those activities are taxable by the City of
Ripley. (3-2-04)
727.16 LEASE OR RENTAL OF PROPERTY.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in the business of
furnishing any real or tangible personal property, which has a tax situs in
this City, or any interest therein, for hire, loan, lease or otherwise, whether
the return is in the form of rentals, royalties, fees or otherwise, the tax
shall be three-fifths of one percent (.60%) of the gross income from any such
activity. "Tangible personal property" as used herein shall not include money
or public securities. (3-2-04)
727.17 EXPIRED.
727.17.1 BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the business of
banking or financial business, from and after July 1, 1971, the tax shall be
equal to seventy-two hundredths of one percent (.72%) of the gross income
received from interest, premiums, discounts, dividends, service fees or
charges, commissions, fines, rents from real or tangible personal property,
however denominated, royalties, charges for bookkeeping or data processing,
receipts from check sales, charges or fees, and receipts from the sale of
tangible personal property; provided, that gross income shall not include:
    (a)    Interest received on the obligations of the United States, its
agencies and instrumentalities;
   (b)    Interest received on the obligations of this or any other state,
territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of
any of the foregoing or of the District of Columbia; or

mortgages or deeds of trust on residential property occupied by nontransients;
provided further, that all interest derived on activities exempt under (c)
above shall be reported, as to amounts, on the return of a person taxable under
the provision of this section. (3-2-04)
727.17.2 STANDARDS FOR REPORTING BANKING BUSINESS INCOME.
   Each person engaging in banking business in the City of Ripley that also
maintains a banking location outside the City of Ripley shall make a good faith
allocation of its gross income in accordance with this article, subject to the
approval of the City Treasurer. Each person subject to this regulation shall
report gross income for Ripley municipal business and occupation tax purposes
to reflect all gross income generated from loans originated and services
provided to customers at or through each banking location within the municipal
limits of Ripley and each such person's report shall fully reflect gross income
earned from investments (other than loans) funded by deposits and repurchase
agreements regularly maintained at or through each banking location within the
municipal limits of Ripley. Other gross income shall be allocated in a
reasonable manner that attributes all income to banking locations. No
allocation methodology used to make such a report shall allocate or apportion
gross income to locations other than a banking location.
   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
   (a)    The phrase "banking location" (and all derivations thereof) means a
physical facility maintained by a person engaged in banking business at which
customers normally personally visit to conduct typical banking transactions,
such as opening of accounts, originating loans, making deposits, etc.
   (b)    Gross income from loans is reportable (without adjustment,
apportionment or allocation) to the banking location at which the loan
originates. The transfer of loan files to a location outside of a municipality
for processing or collection does not alter the taxability of the interest from
such loans with respect to the banking location at which such loans originate.
   (c)    Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or funded
from deposits or repurchase agreements is reportable to banking location(s) in
which deposits giving rise to the income are maintained, regardless of whether
the investments function is managed or directed at a separate location.
Deposits and repurchase agreements are considered maintained only at banking
locations in accordance with reasonable procedures that reflect typical
customer deposit activities and repurchase agreement relationships maintained
at banking locations of the taxpayer subject to the approval of the City
Treasurer. Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or funded
from sources other than deposits or repurchase agreements shall be reported to
banking location(s) in a reasonable manner that fairly allocates all such gross
income to banking locations.
    (d)    Gross income from fees is reportable to the banking location at
which the activity giving rise to the fee is primarily undertaken, using a
reasonable method that fully reports fee income to one or more banking
locations.
   The City Treasurer of the City of Ripley shall have authority to review and
approve reasonable allocation methods in accordance with this article. Each
person subject to this regulation shall establish and maintain sufficient
records for review by the City Treasurer and his or her designee as long as the
contents of such records may be material in the administration of the municipal
business and occupation tax of the City of Ripley along with such additional
information as may otherwise be required. Each person subject to this
regulation shall file reports on such forms designed from time to time by the
City Treasurer and shall follow all instructions in connection therewith.

of the total exemption allowed for the year. When the total tax for which any
person is liable under this article does not exceed the sum of one hundred
dollars ($100.00), in any year, the taxpayer may pay the same quarterly as
aforesaid, or with the consent in writing of the City Treasurer at the end of
the month next following the close of the tax year. Any other provision of this
article notwithstanding, Council if it is deemed necessary to insure payment of
the tax, may require the return and payment under this article for periods of
shorter duration than quarter-year periods.
727.21 TRANSIENT MERCHANTS.
   In the case of a transient merchant as defined in Section
727.01(i), making a transient merchant visit as defined in Section
727.01(j), such a merchant shall prior to transacting any business appear at
City Hall and obtain a soliciting license as provided for in Article
715, or if he shall already have obtained such license he shall in that case
also appear at City Hall prior to transacting any business, and in either case,
shall state in writing, the full and complete names and addresses of each and
every salesperson and solicitor who will be actively or constructively engaged
in the business, in addition to all other reasonable and pertinent information
which may be required, and each applicant shall further provide proof of
compliance with the applicable provisions of the aforementioned "WV Transient
Merchants Licensing Act" and further, shall declare in writing the location or
locations at which he shall be transacting business within the corporate
boundaries; the duration of his transient merchant visit and the date and time
when he shall be departing.
   Thereafter, upon completion of his visit, and prior to his departing from
the corporation boundaries, he shall make and file a return at City Hall, and
pay the total appropriate tax incurred by virtue of the gross income produced
by the conduct of his business during the term of such visit.
727.22 TAX EVASION; PENALTY.
   The penalty for departing from the corporate boundaries with intent to evade
the payment of such tax shall be a fine in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) and/or incarceration for a period not in excess of five days; the
penalty for failure to comply with the information reporting requirements set
forth hereinabove shall be a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
or more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
727.23 TAX RETURNS.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year each
taxpayer shall make a return on the form furnished by the City for the entire
year showing the gross proceeds of sales or gross income of business, trade or
calling, and compute the amount of tax chargeable against him in accordance
with the provisions of this article and deduct the amount of quarterly payments
(as hereinbefore provided), if any, and transmit with his report a remittance
covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him to the City; such return
shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an individual, or by the president,
vice-president, secretary or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a
corporation. If made on behalf of a partnership, joint adventure, association,
trust or any other group or combination acting as a unit, any individual
delegated by such firm, copartnership, joint adventure, association, trust or
any other group or combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf
of the taxpayer. Council, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making
the annual return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable
additional time within which to make the same as may, by them, be deemed
advisable.
727.24 CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERRORS.
   If the taxpayer makes any clerical error which is apparent on the face of
the return in computing the tax accessible against him, the City Treasurer
shall correct such error or reassess the proper amount of taxes, and notify the
taxpayer of his action by mailing to him promptly a copy of the corrected
assessment, and any additional tax for which such taxpayer may be liable shall
be paid within fifteen days after the receipt of such statement. If the amount
already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the tax
so recomputed, the excess as paid shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer
upon the requisition of the City Treasurer to the Mayor who shall issue a
warrant on the Treasurer, which shall be payable out of any funds available for
that purpose. The taxpayer may at his election, apply an overpayment credit to
taxes subsequently accruing hereunder.
727.25 ASSESSMENT BY CITY TREASURER.
   If the City Treasurer believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed
to properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the liability of the taxpayer and make an
assessment therefor.
727.25.1 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   If the City Treasurer believes that the collection of any tax which is
required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make an
assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment. The amount
assessed will be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer against whom
a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment, within twenty (20)
days after service of notice of jeopardy assessment, such assessment becomes
final. Such petition for reassessment must be accompanied by such securities as
the City Treasurer deems necessary.
727.25.2 AMENDED ASSESSMENT.
The City Treasurer may, at any time before the assessment becomes final, amend,
in whole or in part, any assessment whenever he ascertains that such assessment
is improper or incomplete in any material respect.
727.25.3 SUPPLEMENTAL ASSESSMENT.
   The City Treasurer may at any time within the period prescribed for
assessment, make a supplemental assessment whenever he ascertains that any
assessment is incorrect in any material respect.
727.25.4 NOTICES OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT.
   The City Treasurer shall give the taxpayer written notice of any assessment
made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom the notice of
assessment is given shall within thirty (30) days (except if jeopardy
assessment) after service thereof, either personally or by certified mail, file
with the City Treasurer a petition for reassessment in writing verified under
oath by the taxpayer or his duly authorized agent having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for the objections; the assessment shall become
final and not subject to administrative or judicial review. The amount of an
assessment shall be due and payable on the day following the date upon which
the assessment becomes final.
727.25.5 HEARING PROCEDURE; ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.
   When a petition for reassessment as provided in Section
727.25.4 is filed within the time prescribed for such filing, the City
Treasurer shall assign a time and a place for a hearing thereon and shall
notify the petitioner of such hearing by written notice at least twenty days in
advance thereof. Such hearing shall be held within 90 days from the date of
filing the petition, unless continued by agreement of the parties or by the
City Treasurer for sufficient cause.
   The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial manner
by the City Treasurer or a hearing examiner designated by the City Treasurer.
The burden of proof shall be upon the taxpayer to show that the assessment is
incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part.
   After such hearing, the City Treasurer shall, within a reasonable time, give
notice in writing of his decision.
727.25.6 APPEALS TO CIRCUIT COURT.
   An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer to the Circuit Court of Jackson
County within thirty (30) days after service of the City Treasurer's decision.
   The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice, which
petition and notice shall be serviced upon or accepted by the City Treasurer as
an original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it shall, with
the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the office of the Clerk of the
Circuit Court and docketed as other cases, with the taxpayer as plaintiff and
the City Treasurer as defendant. The filing of the appeal shall not stay the
collection of the tax. The collection of the tax shall be stayed if the
plaintiff shall file with such Clerk a bond for the use of the defendant, with
sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the
total amount of the tax, interest and penalties (to such date) appealed from,
and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the court;
provided, that the judge of the Circuit Court may stay the collection of the
tax without the requirement of a bond, upon a proper showing by the taxpayer
that the properties of the taxpayer are sufficient to secure performance of the
Court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served thereby.
   The Court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions submitted
to it on appeal from the determination of the City Treasurer. In such appeal a
certified copy of the City Treasurer's assessment shall be admissible and shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the provisions of this
article. The Court shall render its decree thereon, and a certified copy of the
decree shall be filed by the Clerk of the Court with the City Treasurer, who
shall then correct the assessment in accordance with such decree.
   Unless an appeal is taken pursuant to this section within thirty (30) days
after service of the administrative decision, the City Treasurer's decision
shall become final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or judicial
review. The amount, if any, due the City under such decision shall be due and
payable on the day following the date upon which such decision becomes final.
727.25.7 LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.
   The amount of tax, interest and penalties imposed by this article shall be
assessed within three years after the due date of the fourth quarter return for
the year in which such tax arose; provided, that in the case of a false or
fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade the tax or in case no return
is filed, the assessment may be made at any time.
727.26 ASSESSMENT YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes herein made and the returns required therefor shall
be for the year ending on December 31. If the taxpayer, in exercising a
privilege taxable under this article keeps the books reflecting the same on the
basis other than the calendar year he may with the assent of Council, make his
annual returns and pay taxes for the year covering his accounting period, as
shown by the method of keeping his books.
727.27 TAX IMPOSED IN ADDITION TO OTHER TAXES AND LICENSES.
   The tax imposed by these sections shall be in addition to all other licenses
and taxes levied by law as a condition precedent to engaging in any business,
trade or calling. A person exercising a privilege taxable under this article,
subject to the payment of all licenses and charges which are conditional
precedent to exercising the privilege taxes, may exercise the privilege of
current tax year upon the condition that he pay the tax accruing under this
article.
727.28 REMITTANCE OF TAX.
   Every remittance of taxes imposed by these sections shall be made to the
City Treasurer by bank draft, certified check, cashiers check, money order or
certificate of deposit. The City Treasurer shall deposit the money into the
City Treasury to be kept and accounted for as provided by law.
727.29 FAILURE TO FILE RETURN OR PAY TAX.
   If any person (taxpayer) fails to make the return required by this article,
or makes his return but fails to remit in whole or in part the proper amount of
tax, there shall be added to the amount of the tax unpaid, from the date such
tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the
tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency and one percent
(1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency;
provided, however, that if such failure is due to reasonable cause, Council may
waive in whole or in part those penalties. If the failure to pay is due to
fraud or intent to evade this article and the rules and regulations promulgated
hereunder, there shall be added an additional penalty of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the amount of the tax exclusive of penalties. The penalties so added
shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as a part of the
tax.
727.29.1 INTEREST.
   If any amount of tax administered under this article is not paid on or
before the last date prescribed for payment, interest on such amount at the
rate of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be paid for the period from such
last date to the date paid. For the purposes of this Section, the last date
prescribed for payment shall be the due date of the return and shall be
determined without regard to any extension of time for payment.
727.30 TAX AS DEBT DUE.
   A tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt due the City. It
shall be a personal obligation of the taxpayer and shall be a lien upon the
property of the taxpayer; provided however, that such lien shall be subject to
the restrictions and conditions embodied in this article.
727.31 COLLECTION OF TAXES DUE.
   Council may collect any tax, interest and penalties due and unpaid under the
provisions of this article by action in debt, assumpsit, motion for judgment or
other appropriate proceedings in the county in which:
   (a)    The activity taxed was engaged in; or
   (b)    Any county in which property of the taxpayer may be found; or
if the tax due and unpaid under these sections is three hundred dollars
($300.00) or less, by suit in the court of competent jurisdiction having
jurisdiction of the taxpayer or of his property.
   If the failure of any taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this article
continues sixty days, Council may proceed to obtain an injunction restraining
the taxpayer from doing business in this County until he fully complies with
the provisions of this article. In any proceeding under this judgment or decree
for the plaintiff, he shall be awarded his costs. In the event a business
subject to the tax imposed by this article is operated in connection with a
receivership or insolvency proceeding, the court under whose direction such
business is operated shall, by the entry of a proper order in the cause, make
provision for the regular payment of such taxes as the same become due.
727.32 RETURN OF SECESSION OF BUSINESS.
   Any person exercising any privilege taxable under this section who sells out
his business or stock of goods, or ceases doing business, shall file the return
prescribed by this article and remit the entire tax that may be chargeable
against him because of all business done, within thirty days after selling out
his business or stock of goods, or ceasing to do such business. The tax imposed
by this article shall be a lien upon the property of such person.
727.33 WITHHOLDING TAX.
   (a)    Tax Due by Purchaser from Purchase Price. The successor in business
of any person shall withhold so much of the purchase money as will satisfy the
taxes and penalty which may be due until the former owner produces a receipt
from Council evidencing the payment of such taxes and penalty. If the purchaser
of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold purchase money as above
provided, and the taxes and penalty remain unpaid after expiration of the
thirty- day period allowed for payment thereof, he shall be personally liable
for the payment of all such taxes and penalty, and the same shall be
recoverable by Council by action or suit provided by this article.
   (b)    Tax From Final Settlement of Contract. All state and county officers
and agents making contracts on behalf of the State or political subdivisions
thereof shall withhold payment for final settlement of such contracts until the
receipt of a certificate from the City Treasurer to the effect that all taxes
levied or accrued under this article against the contractors have been paid.
   (c)    Tax From Final Settlement of Contract with Nonresident. Any person,
firm or corporation contracting with a nonresident firm, person or corporation
engaged in a business or service taxed under this article shall withhold
payment in sufficient amounts to cover taxes assessed by this article in the
final settlement of such contracts until the receipt of a certificate from the
City Treasurer to the effect that all taxes levied or assessed under this
article against the contractor have been paid. If any person, firm or
corporation fails to withhold as provided herein, he shall be personally liable
for the payment of all such taxes and the same shall be recoverable by the City
by appropriate legal proceedings.
727.34 CERTIFIED COPY OF ASSESSMENT; FILING.
   Council for the more effective collection of the tax may file with the Clerk
of the County Court a certified copy of an assessment of taxes under these
sections. A certificate so filed shall be recorded in a book provided for the
purpose and thereafter shall constitute binding notice of the lien created by
these sections upon all lands of the taxpayer located in the county as against
all parties whose interest arose after such recordation. Upon payment of taxes
delinquent under this article the lien of which has been recorded, Council
shall certify in duplicate the fact and amount of payment and the balance due,
if any and shall forward the certificates, one to the taxpayer and one to the
Clerk of the County Court of the county where the taxpayer has been listed as
delinquent. The Clerk of the County Court shall record the certificate in the
book where the releases are recorded, without payment of any additional fee.
From the date that such a certificate is admitted to record, the land of the
taxpayer in the county shall be free from any lien under these sections accrued
to the date that the certificate was issued.
727.35 ADMINISTRATION OF ARTICLE.
   The administration of these sections is vested in and shall be exercised by
the City Treasurer who shall prescribe forms and reasonable rules in conformity
with this article, for the making of returns and for the ascertainment,
assessment and collection of the taxes imposed hereunder; and the enforcement
of any of the provisions of this article in any of the courts of the State
shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Mayor and Council.
   The City Treasurer may execute and deliver binding agreements with other
municipalities to carry out the provisions of the article respecting
cooperation and tax administration, including sourcing of gross income for
municipal business and occupation tax purposes.
727.36 CONFIDENTIALITY OF TAX INFORMATION.
   (a)    Secrecy of Returns. Except when required in an official investigation
into the amount of tax due the City or in any proceeding before a court of
competent jurisdiction to collect or ascertain the amount of such tax, and
except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) hereof no officer or employee of
the City shall divulge or make known in any manner the tax return, or any part
thereof, of any individual, firm or corporation, or disclose information
concerning the personal affairs of any individual or the business of any single
firm or corporation, or disclose the amount of income or any particulars set
forth or disclosed in any report, declaration or return required to be filed
with the City.
   Any officer, employee or agent of the City or any former officer, employee
or agent of the City who makes unauthorized disclosure of information received

between this City and the State Tax Commissioner, shall be fined not more than
one thousand dollars ($ 1,000) or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or
both fined and imprisoned.
   For the purposes of this section, "unauthorized disclosure" means the
release to any person of any tax information obtained by the City from the
State Tax Commissioner, unless:
      (1)    The person receiving the information is the authorized counsel of
the State or the City and shall be using the information only for the purpose
of administering Business or Occupation Tax.
      (2)    The person who filed the return has authorized, in writing, its
release, thereby waiving his or her right to secrecy.
   (b)    Reciprocal Exchange. The City Treasurer may permit the proper officer
of the United States, the State, the District of Columbia or any other state,
or any political subdivision of the State, or his or her authorized
representative, to inspect reports, declarations or returns filed with the City
Treasurer or may furnish to such officer or representative a copy of any such
document, provided such other jurisdiction grants substantially similar
privileges to the City.
   (c)    Inspection of Business and Occupation Tax Returns by State Tax
Commissioner. The City Treasurer shall, upon the written request of the State
Tax Commissioner or his designated agent, allow such Commissioner or his duly
authorized agent to inspect and make copies of the City Business and Occupation
Tax returns filed by taxpayers of the City, for the purpose of securing
information for State tax purposes, provided the State allows the City
Treasurer the right to inspect or make copies of the State Business and
Occupation Tax returns of such taxpayer.
727.37 SUBPOENA AND SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM.
   (a)    Power to Issue. For the efficient administration of the powers vested
in the City Treasurer by this article, and to facilitate determination or
collection of tax under this article, the City Treasurer or his delegate, with
the concurrence of the City Attorney, shall have the power to issue subpoenas
and subpoenas duces tecum in the name of the City, and compel the attendance of
witnesses and the production of books, papers, records, documents and testimony

purposes of such hearing.
   (b)    Service. Every such subpoena and subpoena duces tecum shall be served
at least five days before the return date thereof, by either personal service
made by any person over eighteen years of age, or by registered or certified
mail, but a return receipt signed by the person to whom subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum is directed shall be required to prove service by registered or
certified mail. Any party requesting a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is
responsible for service thereof and payment of any fee for such service.
Service of other subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum shall be the responsibility
of the City Treasurer or his delegate. Any person, except a person in the
employ of the City, or any party, who serves any such subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum shall be entitled to the same fee as sheriffs who serve witness
subpoenas for the circuit courts of this State.
   (c)    Motion to Quash. Upon motion made promptly, and in any event before
the time specified in a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum for compliance
therewith, the circuit court of the county in which the hearing is to be held
or the circuit court of the county in which the person upon whom any such
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum was served resides, has his or its principal
place of business or is employed, or the circuit court of the county in which
any such subpoena or subpoena duces tecum was served, or the judge of such
circuit court in vacation, may grant any relief with respect to any such
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum which any such circuit court, under the "West
Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure for Trial Courts of Record" could grant, and
for any of the same reasons, with respect to any such subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum issued from any such circuit court.
   (d)    Enforcement of Compliance. In case of disobedience or neglect of any
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum served on any person, or the refusal of any
witness to testify to any matter regarding which he may be lawfully
interrogated, the Circuit Court of Jackson County, upon application by the City
Treasurer, with concurrence of the City Attorney, may compel obedience by
attachment proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the
requirements of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued from such Circuit
Court for a refusal to testify therein.

testify under oath or affirmation.

739.01 CHARGE FOR STREET MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT.
   (a)    Council hereby finds that the street maintenance and improvement
services to City streets afforded and provided the people of this City are
essential municipal services and that the general revenues of the City are not
sufficient for the purpose of providing adequate City street maintenance and
improvements. Therefore, in order to provide for the continuance and
furtherance of such maintenance and improvements to and for the people of this
City, there is hereby imposed upon, and shall be collected from, the users of
such service a service charge at the rate of two dollars ($2.00) per month
beginning March 1, 1986. Finding that general revenues of the City are adequate
for the purpose of providing adequate street maintenance and improvement, the
rate of zero dollars ($0.00) shall be charged per month beginning July 1, 2020.
“Users” within the meaning of this section include users of City utilities
residing within the City limits, owners of real or personal property which is
subject to taxation by the City and persons having a place of business within
the City limits. (10-1-19)
   (b)    The special service charge imposed by this section shall be in
addition to all other taxes and license fees imposed by the City or by the
State.
   (c)    The collection of the special service charges imposed by subsection
(a) hereof, shall be done by monthly billing, by placing such charges upon the
face of the monthly utility bills issued by the City Water Department, and by
such other means as are necessary and appropriate. In the case of any person
acting as a landlord, owning, controlling or managing a rental property
consisting of a single residence or multiple residences, singly or grouped
within a single building, located within the City limits, the tenants of which
do not receive individual separate water bills, such landlord shall report and
keep current such report on a monthly basis of the number of users occupying
rental residence unit households to the City administrative office and such
landlord shall be billed for the special charge for street maintenance and
improvement, assessed for each such user. Such landlord shall collect such
special charge for street maintenance and improvement and remit the charges to
the City in payment of such billing. The penalty for failure to report such
number of users and/or failure to collect and remit such charges shall be a
fine not in excess of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per rental unit per month
for each month of noncompliance.
   (d)    The Mayor shall collect the special service charges imposed by this
section and all such special service charges are hereby declared to be debts
owning to the City for which the debtor shall be personally liable. The Mayor
may enforce this liability by appropriate civil action in any court of
competent jurisdiction and is hereby vested with the same rights to distrain
therefor as are vested in the County Sheriff for the collection of taxes.
(1960 Code 5-400)
   (e)    The moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be segregated
from the general fund and shall be placed in a special fund account entitled
"Street Maintenance and Improvement Fund", and such moneys shall be expended
solely and exclusively for the construction, maintenance or repair of City
streets, which may include curbs and sidewalks.
(8-16-94)
739.02 SPECIAL CHARGE FOR MUNICIPAL POLICE AND FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES.
   The Common Council hereby finds that the Police and Fire Department
protection afforded by the Police Department and Fire Department to the people
in this City is an essential municipal service, and that the general revenues
of the City are not sufficient for the purpose of providing adequate police and
fire protection within the City. Therefore, in order to provide for the
continuance, maintenance and improvement of the essential service of affording
police and fire protection to the people in this City, there is hereby imposed
upon, and shall be collected from, the users of such service a charge at the
rate of five dollars ($5.00) per month beginning May 1, 2004. Finding that the
general revenues of the City are now adequate for providing police and fire
protection to the people in this City, the rate of zero dollars ($0.00) shall
be charged per month beginning July 1, 2020. The term “users" within the
meaning of this section shall include every owner of real and personal property
which is subject to taxation by the City, every person occupying a residence
within the City, and every person having a place of business within the City
which is subject to any City license. Provided, however, that each such
residence or business shall be subject to only one such fee or charge directed
to the head of the household or landlord for a residence and the owner or
operator of a business or commercial enterprise. Provided, further, in a mixed-
use building containing a business and one or more residential apartments or
living spaces, each such business and each such apartment or living space shall
be subject to the appropriate fee.
   The special service charge imposed by this section shall be in addition to
all other taxes and license fees imposed by the City or by the State.

745.14 GENERAL PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Finance Officer as Agent of City. The Finance Officer shall be the

power to distrain property and to initiate civil suits for collection of the
tax authorized by this article.
   The Finance Officer shall have the power and the duty to issue tax returns
for this tax.
 
   (b)   Assessment of Tax When Insufficiently Returned. If the Finance Officer
believes that the tax imposed by this article has been insufficiently returned
by an operator, either because the operator has failed or refused to properly
collect or remit the tax, or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the operator and
make an assessment therefor. Assessments shall be served upon the taxpayer,
either personally or by certified mail.
 
   (c)   Notice of Assessment; Petition for Reassessment. The Finance Officer
shall give the operator written notice of any assessment made pursuant to this
article. Unless the operator to whom a notice of assessment is given shall,
within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or by certified
mail, file with the Finance Officer a petition in writing, verified under oath
by the operator or his duly authorized agent having knowledge of the fact,
setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected to,
together with the reasons for the objections, the assessment shall become final
and not subject to administrative or judicial review. The amount of an
assessment shall be due and payable on the day following the date upon which
the assessment becomes final.
 
   (d)   Hearing Procedure; Administrative Decision.
      (1)   When a petition for reassessment provided for in subsection (c)
hereof is filed within the time prescribed in such subsection for such filing,
the Finance Officer shall assign a time and place of a hearing hereon and shall
notify the operator of such hearing by written notice at least twenty days in
advance thereof. Such hearing shall be held within 100 days from the date of
filing the petition unless continued by agreement of the parties or by the
Finance Officer for sufficient cause.
      (2)   The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an
impartial manner by the Finance Officer or a hearing examiner designated by the
Finance Officer. The burden of proof shall be upon the operator to show the
assessment is incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part.
      (3)   After any such hearing, the Finance Officer or a hearing examiner
shall, within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, give notice in
writing of his decision.
   (e)   Appeals to Circuit Court. 
      (1)   An appeal may be taken by the operator to the Circuit Court of
Jackson County within thirty days after service of the Finance Officer's
hearing examiner's decision.
      (2)   The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the Finance
Officer as an original notice. When the petition and notice are so served they
shall, with the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the office of the
Clerk of the Circuit Court and docketed as other cases, with the operator as
plaintiff and the Finance Officer as defendant. The filing of the appeal shall
not stay the collection of the tax. The collection of the tax shall be stayed
if the plaintiff shall file with such Clerk, a bond for the use of the
defendant, with sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the bond to be
not less than the total amount of the tax, interest and penalties (to such
date) appealed from and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders
of the Court; provided, that a Judge of the Circuit Court may stay the
collection of the tax without the requirement of a bond upon a proper showing
by the operator that the properties of the operator are sufficient to secure
performance of the Court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served
thereby.
      (3)   The Court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions
submitted to it on appeal from the determination of the Finance Officer. In
such appeal, a certified copy of the Finance Officer's assessment shall be
admissible and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the
provisions of this article. The Court shall render its decree thereon; and a
certified copy of the decree shall be filed by the Clerk of the Court with the
Finance Officer, who shall then, if applicable, correct the assessment in
accordance with such decree.
      (4)   Unless an appeal is taken pursuant to this section within thirty
days after service of the administrative decision, the Finance Officer's
decision shall become final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or
judicial review. The amount, if any, due the City under such decision shall be
due and payable on the day following the date upon which such decision becomes
final.
 
   (f)   Tax Constitutes Debt Due City. Any tax, penalties or interest due and
payable under this article shall be a debt due the City and shall be
recoverable in an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of
such tax, penalty or interest.
 
   (g)   Injunction. If the failure of any operator to comply with the
provisions of this article has continued sixty days, the Finance Officer may
proceed to obtain an injunction restraining the operator from doing business in
this City until he fully complies with the provisions of this article. In any
proceeding under this section upon judgment or decree for the plaintiff, he
shall be awarded his costs.
 
   (h)   Records; Limitation on Assessments. The amount of tax, interest and
penalties imposed by this article shall be assessed within two years after the
due date of the return, provided, that in the case of a false or fraudulent
return filed with the intent to evade the tax or in case no return is filed,
the assessment may be made at any time.
 
   (i)   Refunds.
      (1)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been over
paid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under the provisions of this article, it may be refunded
as provided in subsections (i)(2) and (3) hereof, if a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the City within two years of the date of
payment of such tax, interest or penalty. Claims for refund shall be made in
writing.
      (2)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established that the person from
whom the tax has been collected was not liable for the payment of such tax;
provided however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless
the amount of the tax so collected has been refunded to the person from whom
the tax was collected.
      (3)   A person paying the tax may obtain a refund of tax overpaid or paid
more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing a claim for refund, but only when the tax was paid by such person
directly to the City or when such person, having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes that such person has been unable to obtain a refund from the
operator who collected the tax.
      (4)   No refund shall be paid unless the claimant establishes his right
thereto by written records evidencing this entitlement thereto.

Virginia Legislature. The Council declares that this article be construed so as
to accomplish the purpose to enact a municipal sales and service tax and a use
tax pursuant to West Virginia Code 8-1-5a for the maximum financial benefit of
the City of Ripley.

subsequently reinstates or raises municipal business and occupation tax it
previously reduced or eliminated under the Home Rule Program, it shall
eliminate the municipal sales tax enacted under the Municipal Home Rule
Program. The City recognizes the potential consequences if the taxes imposed by
Article
727 of Ripley City Code related to manufacturing companies and to places of
amusement are reinstated.

asphalt impregnated fiberboard joints into blocks six feet long, except at
closures where necessary adjustments shall be approved by the Building
Inspector.

beneath the walk and drained into the gutter or to an available storm sewer
where possible.
   (h)    Forms. All sidewalks constructed shall be formed to the required
line, grade and slope by the use of either steel or wood forms properly secured
so that neither the placing of materials of construction nor the finishing of
the surface can disturb them horizontally or vertically.

(1-18-05)
937.06 REQUIREMENTS.
    (a)    Water Purveyor.
      (1)   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide an on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer assembly(blies), if any, that will be required based on
actual or potential cross-connections and the degree of health hazards.
      (2)    For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises for actual and potential cross-connections and backflow conditions and
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to
be made. ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However, this time
period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the
history of the device(s)/assembly(blies) already in place.
      (3)    The Water Purveyor will not allow any actual or potential cross-
connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved air gap or backflow
preventer assembly(blies) and which must be regularly tested or inspected to
insure satisfactory operation.
      (4)    The Water Purveyor shall inform the owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, prior to a re-inspection. The Water Purveyor will allow an
additional fifteen days for the correction(s). In the event the owner fails to
comply with the necessary correction(s) by the time of a second re- inspection,
the Water Purveyor will inform the owner by letter, that the water service to
the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five
days. In the event that the owner informs the Water Purveyor of extenuating
circumstances as to why the correction(s) has not been made, a time extension
may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an additional
thirty days.
      (5)    If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)    The Water Purveyor will conduct initial and follow-up premise
inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. The main
focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (7)    The Water Purveyor must report any backflow incident(s) occurring
in the public water system as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four
hours after the incident to the WVBPH.
   (b)    Owner.
      (1)    The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all actual or potential cross-connections and/or backflow conditions on his/
her premises.
      (2)    The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventer assemblies on his premises.
      (3)    The owner shall correct within thirty days any malfunction of an
air gap or backflow preventer assembly(blies) which is revealed by periodic
inspection or testing. This may also involve the removal and/or replacement of
the backflow preventer assembly(blies).
      (4)    The owner shall inform the Water Purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
owner is aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
      (5)    The owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow
preventer assembly unless there is a backflow preventer assembly of the same
type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the
assembly(blies) must supply additional assemblies necessary to allow testing to
take place.
      (6)    The owner shall install only backflow preventer assemblies
approved by the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (7)    The owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies in a manner
approved by the Water Purveyor and general industry standards.
      (8)    Any Owner having a private well or other auxiliary water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system. Permission to cross
connect may be denied. The owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer assembly at the service entrance if a private water source is
maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system.
      (9)    In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor's side of a backflow
preventer assembly, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer assembly
installed.
      (10)    The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
service, permits, periodic assembly testing, retesting in the case that a
backflow preventer assembly fails to operate correctly, and follow-up re-
inspections for non-compliance with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.

installation and removal, all testing, repair and maintenance for all
assemblies/devices in the owner's water distribution system(s).
      (12)    The owner will report any backflow incident(s) occurring in their
facility(ties)/building(s) as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four
hours after the incident to the Water Purveyor and to the WVBPH. Also, the
owner must maintain for a minimum of three years all records and reports of all
backflow incidents occurring in their facility(ties)/building(s). These records
and reports are to be made available to the Water Purveyor and/or WVBPH upon
request.
         (1-18-05)
937.07 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross- connections and backflow conditions. All threats will be classified
by degree of hazard which will determine the requirements for the installation
of approved backflow preventer assemblies.
(1-18-05)
937.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer assembly shall be allowed by the Water
Purveyor to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to
supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer assembly, or
there is an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard
has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow preventer assemblies must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure
principle assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow preventer
assembly is present.
(1-18-05)
937.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)    Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)    Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner's expense.
   (c)    Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the owner's expense to insure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty days after the test date may be established. The owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts, or
a replacement assembly. Parallel installation of two assemblies is an effective
means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during testing or
repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the owner
desires such continuity.
   (d)    Backflow preventer assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a) hereof in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner. (1-18-05)
937.10 RECORDS.
   (a)    The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain(update) the following:
      (1)    Master files on customer evaluations and/or inspections of cross-
connections and backflow conditions.
      (2)    Master files on all customer backfow preventer assemblies.
      (3)    Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs and
replacements. Records for replaced backflow preventer shall be maintained for a
period of one (1) year after date of removal from service.
      (4)    Records and reports of any backflow incident(s) occurring in the
public or consumer water systems shall be maintained for at least three years
after the date of the incident.
      (5)    Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH. This material shall be maintained for at least three
years after submission.
   (b)    Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection
and noncompliance, surveys, tests results and/or corrective actions, and
backflow incident reports to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health. (1-18-

SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN CASES WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE IS CONNECTED TO
THE CITY’S SANITARY SYSTEM
APPLICABILITY: Whenever the City has discovered that a customer’s roof drain,
downspouts, storm sewer, or other similar facilities conducting surface water
has been connected to the City’s sewer system and such customer has failed to
take appropriate action within 30 days of receipt of a demand by the City, in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission to
eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   S = A x R x .0006233 x C
   S =   The surcharge in dollars.
   A =   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet.
   R =    The measured monthly rainfall, in inches.
   .0006233 =   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water.
   C =   The City’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage.
The City shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has been
notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery, that
it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site inspection
that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the sanitary sewer
system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not acted within
30 days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from the sanitary sewer
system.
Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.

with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (8)   Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a
"slug" as defined herein.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, from suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
 
   (e)   Conditional Service. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof,
and which in the judgment of the Manager may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Manager
may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes.
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
public sewers.
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
      (4)   Require payment of cover added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
Section

mail any statement for monthly charges shall not be grounds for avoiding
payment. If the fee, rate or charge for any monthly service charge is not paid
within fifteen days after the same is due the amount thereof shall then be
delinquent and may be recovered by the City in any appropriate action, and the
fees, rates and charges for the service mentioned above in this section shall,
if not paid when due, constitute a lien upon the premises served, and which
lien may be foreclosed against the lot, parcel of land or building served in
accordance with the laws of West Virginia relating to the foreclosure of liens
on real property. On the first day of each month the City shall file in the

No person shall place, cast, discharge or deposit such offensive material upon

therein. However, in the case of nonresident owners who have no known agents in
the City, such notices may be given by publication of one week in any newspaper
of general circulation published in the City.

shall name and describe the location of the lot upon which such work has been
done, and give the name of the owner thereof. If the name of the owner is

may be identified. The notice shall state the amount assessed against the lot
for the cost of the work and shall cite the owner thereof to appear before
Council within thirty days of the first publication of the notice to show
cause, if any, why such assessment should not be final. The notice shall be

Court of the State.

property nor in the materials designated to be cut and removed shall affect the
validity of any such notice, provided that from the description of such lot,
land or property the identity thereof may be established with reasonable
certainty.
 
   (e)   The payment of the amount so chargeable to the owner shall not relieve
him of any fine imposed under the provisions of this article or constitute a
defense against any violation of the provisions of Section
1113.07. Each day of failure to comply with the provisions of Section

   (b)   Any other dwelling designed and manufactured in two or more

   "Mobile home park" means any lot or parcel of land used or intended to be
used for the accommodation of four or more mobile homes.

residence if the home is placed and installed on a permanent perimeter
foundation and thereafter, shall be treated in every respect as a permanent
residence.

   (e)   Specifically, West Virginia Code 8-12-16(a), (n) if a registration fee
remains delinquent for two years from the date it was placed on record in the
clerk of the county commission in which the property is located and assessed,
the municipality may take action to receive the subject property by means of
forfeiture. Should the municipality take the steps necessary to receive the
subject property, the municipality then becomes the owner of record and takes
the property, the municipality then becomes the owner of record and takes the
property subject to all liens and real and personal and property taxes.
   (f)   The City of Ripley believes abandoned and unkept properties cause
decay in the City’s neighborhoods and a decline in the value of neighboring
properties while creating unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.
   (g)   The fiscal impact of unkept or blighted properties has an adverse
effect on the municipality, the individual property owners and community/
neighborhood development. The City of Ripley has to deal with health and safety
issues related to the property and the individual proeprty owners and
neighborhood must also contend with the same issues and the ramifications of
the devaluation of their own property investments.
   (h)   The City of Ripley Council hereby creates Section
1717.10. If a registration fee remains delinquent for twelve months from the
date it was placed on record in the Office of the Clerk of the Jackson County
Commission, West Virginia, the City of Ripley may take action to receive the
subject property by means of forfeiture. Should the City of Ripley take the
steps necessary to receive the subject property, the City of Ripley becomes the
owner of record and takes the property subject to all liens and real and
personal property taxes.

1741.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)    Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be those of the
City of Ripley, which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as shown
on the Floodway, Flood Hazard Boundary and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
and described on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of
Ripley by the Federal Emergency Agency (FEMA) dated February 4, 2004, or the
most recent revision thereof.
   (b)    Description of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)    The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway area identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (b)(4) hereof. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator for floodway area identified in approximated areas
discussed in subsection (b)(4) hereof.
      (2)    The Floodway Fringe (F2) area shall be that for which specific one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but which lie
beyond the floodway area. The areas are shown on the floodway map or FIRM.
      (3)    The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas for which
100 year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no Floodway has
been delineated.
      (4)    The approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the floodway map or FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided for these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined by using the
elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area, which
is nearest the construction site. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to determine the Base Flood Elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Only a registered professional engineer shall undertake
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
layman's terms. In addition the County shall submit studies, analyses,
computations, etc., in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review.
   (c)    Changes in Designation of Area. The delineation of the identified
floodplain area
may be revised by City of Ripley where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. The community using simple
methods involving locally derived information, flood of record and topographic
data, may delineate new approximated areas. However, prior to any such change
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   (d)    Elevations Prevail. If the lowest natural grade adjacent to a
proposed building site that is within the floodplain area is at or above the
Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure
shall not be required to conform with the Design and Construction Standards or
Flood-Related Building Codes in Section
1741.06 . Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted to the Floodplain
Administrator in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review. In addition, the
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the Special Flood Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel
or structure allowing the applicant to obtain correctly rated flood insurance
and possibly qualify for a Preferred Risk Policy.
   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to a proposed building site shown
outside of, but adjacent to, the floodplain area is below the Base Flood
Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site shall be considered
to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure shall be required
to conform with the provision of this article.
   (e)    Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, the Floodplain Administrator shall make initial determination and any
party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Ripley. The burden
of proof shall be on the appellant.
(1-6-04)
1741.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)    Floodway (F1). Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any
increase in the Base Flood Elevation. All uses, activities, and other
development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and
related provisions contained herein, and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   The Floodway shall be preserved to carry the discharge of the base flood to
the greatest extent possible. Floodways present increased risks to human life
and property because of their
relatively faster and deeper flowing waters. New development shall not be
permitted in the floodway where reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In
addition to the above requirements the applicant shall demonstrate that there
are no reasonable alternatives other than the floodway encroachment before a
permit may be used. (If the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.)
   (b)    Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F3). In the
Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximate Floodplain (F3), any development and/or
use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or
development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations. All subdivision proposals and other proposed new
developments which are necessary to take place either fully or partially within
the Approximated Floodplain (F3) and which are greater than fifty (50) lots or
five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
Data shall be provided by an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service,
state and local water resource departments, or technical data developed using
detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance
Study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional
engineer or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)    Floodplain Area AE.  Within any AE area *, no new construction or
development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood
more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by use
of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)    Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.
      (1)    Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a watercourse
within the Floodplain Area, the developer shall notify in writing, by certified
mail, all adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Officer of all such
intended activities prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse,
and shall submit copies of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administrator and Ripley.
       (2)    The developer shall also assure Ripley that the carrying capacity
of the altered or relocated portion of stream will be maintained. The County
may require the applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment
will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. Only
registered professional engineers shall undertake hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in layman's terms. In addition
the County shall submit studies, analyses, computations, etc., in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review.
      (3)    Ripley may require the use of certain "best practices" techniques
in the construction of bridges, culverts or other stream alterations to prevent
localized flooding caused by blockages. The techniques may include, but are not
limited to wing walls, trash grates or openings sized to carry anticipated
increase in flood heights.
      (4)    The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed.
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to have the agreement
referenced in and recorded with deed of the subject property before a permit
can be issued.
      (5)    The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the Local
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
         (1-6-04)
*    AE areas without floodway only occur under the following conditions: When
a study has been conducted on a stream to produce Base Flood Elevation data,
but no floodway delineation is given. Remember to check the FIRM and the
Floodway map to see if a floodway has been delineated before applying these
conditions. (1-6-04)

      (2)    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use or meet the provision
of subsection (b)(1) and (3) hereof. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highways use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (e)    Fill. Ripley officially recognizes the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain thus placement of fill in the floodplain area is
discouraged and shall be minimized. In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted
unless it meets the requirements of Section
1741.04(a). Any fill proposed to be deposited in the floodway must be shown to
have some beneficial purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner
showing the uses to which the filled land will be put and the final dimensions
of the proposed fill or other materials. All fill placed in the floodplain
shall meet or exceed the following standards.
      (1)    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The County may require the applicant to
show through hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques that proposed fill
will not adversely affect adjacent properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by registered professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The

longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and
      (2)    So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on
the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
   (g)    Anchoring.
      (1)   All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement, thus reducing the threat to life and property and decreasing the
possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and other restricted sections of
the watercourse.
      (2)    All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below
the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
      (3)    All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with the
requirements of 42 CSR Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10b as authorized by
West Virginia Code Chapter 21-9. This anchoring shall be adequate to resist

   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article shall
adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)    Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals
Authority upon:
         A.    A showing of good and sufficient cause,
         B.    A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
         C.    A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinance.
      (2)    An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
      (3)    An affirmative decision may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)    The Appeals Authority shall notify the applicant in writing over
the signature of a community official that:
          A.    The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure
below the base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance,
         B.    Such construction below Base Flood Elevation increases risk to
life and property. Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all
decisions as required in paragraph (4) of this section; and
      (5)    The Appeals Authority shall:

1741.09 SEVERABILITY AND MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   (a)    Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this article
which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the
provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)    Municipal Liability. The granting of a permit or approval of a
subdivision or development plan in an identified flood-prone area, shall not
constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by Ripley or by
any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon Ripley. To increase the level
of safety from flooding applicants are urged to build "higher up and further
back" from any watercourse. (1-6-04)
