EDITOR'S NOTE
 
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
 
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

   Following the separation of the State of Virginia and the State of West
Virginia, a Special Act of the West Virginia Legislature, known as Chapter 16
of the Acts of 1867, was enacted which gave the Village of Barboursville a
corporate status.
   After the adoption of the present Constitution, in which it is provided that
no special charter may be granted by the Legislature to cities, towns or
villages unless the population therein is in excess of 2,000 persons, old
Chapter 47 of the Code prior to the Code of 1931, provided that any town or
village acting under special charter by resolution could adopt the provisions
of the general laws of the state, and the Common Council of the Village of
Barboursville on May 11, 1903, did so adopt the provisions of the general laws
of the state pertaining to the government of Cities, Towns and Villages.
   Attention is invited to the fact that in the Official Code of West Virginia,
edition of 1931, and all subsequent codes, old Chapter 47, is known as Chapter
8.
   Also the Common Council of the Village, in order to provide for the paving
of its streets and the installment plan of payment therefor, proposed and at a
special election held in the Village on the 26 day of June, 1923, the voters
adopted the provisions of Chapter 8 of the Acts of the Legislature of 1908,
which is now known as Article 9 of Chapter 8 of the Code of West Virginia,
edition of 1931.
   And with all of these acts, resolutions and ordinances, and the Charter
which follows, the legislative status of the Village of Barboursville is
complete.

this Charter or general law. Council shall meet regularly on the first and
third Tuesday of each month, at 7:30 p.m. local time in the Council Chambers at
City Hall, excepting only when a regularly scheduled Council meeting shall
occur on a legal holiday. Council shall, in that event, meet at such time as

meetings may be called at any time, upon reasonable notice by the Mayor or the
Acting Mayor, and shall be so called by the Mayor or Acting Mayor upon the

notice may be satisfied by delivering to each member of Council a written
notice of the time, place and purpose of the special meeting in the method
provided by law for the service of process in a civil action at least twelve
hours prior to the time set for the meeting or by such other method as Council
may by ordinance provide. No other meetings of Council, except as herein
provided, shall qualify for any purpose under this Charter.

enacted or passed by the Council, and shall perform such other duties as may be
required by this Charter, Council or general law.
SECTION 3.7 ORDINANCES; PROCEDURE.

enactment of ordinances shall be carried out in the manner provided in Chapter
8, Article 11 of the Official Code of West Virginia.
SECTION 3.8 MEETINGS TO BE PUBLIC.
   The meetings of Council shall be open to the public; provided, however,
Council may hold a closed, executive session, for the purpose of discussing any

requirements of Chapter 6, Article 9A of the Official Code of West Virginia,
and any other applicable law.
SECTION 3.9 COUNCIL TO BE JUDGE OF QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS.
   Council shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its members,

offices, departments, divisions, boards or agencies established by this
Charter, but the Mayor may not discontinue such duties or functions without the

reassign to any other office, department, division, board or agency any
function or duty assigned by this Charter to a particular office, department,
division, board or agency.
SECTION 3.11 VACANCIES.
   If a Council member is elected to any public office other than Mayor,
Village Recorder, or member of the Village Council, absents himself or herself
from forty or more percent of the meetings scheduled in accordance with Section
3.5 herein in any twelve month period, ceases to possess any of the
qualifications required by this Charter, becomes physically or mentally
incapacitated to the extent that he or she is unable to properly perform the
functions of the office or is convicted of a felony or any crime involving
moral turpitude, he or she shall be disqualified from holding the office of
Council member and such office shall thereby become vacant and shall be so
declared by Council forthwith. Any Council member may be removed from office
under the provisions of general law. If a Council member absents himself or
herself from forty or more percent of Council meetings as provided herein, such
absence shall, ipso facto, constitute neglect of duty. If a vacancy on Council
shall occur as aforesaid or by reason of death, resignation, removal or other
cause, such vacancy shall be filled as follows: The remaining members of
Council shall select a citizen willing to serve, and with the requisite
qualifications, by a majority vote of its remaining members at a meeting held
not less than fifteen nor more than thirty days following the declaration of
such vacancy. The person so appointed shall hold office for the unexpired term
or until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified. In the event
Council shall fail to choose a qualified successor, as provided herein, the
Mayor shall appoint a person with the requisite qualifications to fill the
vacancy for the unexpired term or until his or her successor has been duly
elected and qualified. Such appointment shall be made within sixty days from
the date said vacancy occurs.
SECTION 3.12 COMPENSATION.
   Each member of Council shall receive an annual salary during his or term of
office. Council members may waive this compensation and serve their terms
voluntarily. Council shall, by duly enacted ordinance, address itself to the
issue of compensation, including setting the salary and benefits, for the
Mayor, the Village Recorder, and for Council members. In no case shall any
change in the salary of Council members or of the Mayor or the Village Recorder
become effective during the current term of any Council member, Mayor or
Village Recorder.
(Amended 6-5-03; 6-19-07; 6-4-15; 5-16-23)
SECTION 3.13 CODIFICATION OF ORDINANCES.
   Council shall, within five years of the effective date of this Charter and
at least every eight years thereafter, cause to be prepared a Municipal Code
with an adequate index containing all ordinances of general application which
are appropriate for continuation as law. Such Code may be prepared by the
Village Attorney or Council may contract for its preparation by professional
persons or by organizations experienced in the revision and codification of
ordinances or statutes. When the Code, or any general revision thereof, shall
have been prepared, Council shall cause copies of the same to be prepared and
made available for public distribution. No ordinance approving such Code or
revision shall be adopted until ninety days have elapsed following the date on
which Council shall have noted in its official journal the availability of
copies of such proposed Code to the public nor until compliance with all
applicable law. The Code and general revisions thereof need not be printed in
the official journal, but Council shall cause the Code and revisions to be
published and distributed to the public at such reasonable price as may be
established. All ordinances of general application, adopted after the approval
of the Code, shall be adopted as amendments to the Code, shall indicate the
section numbers to be assigned to the text of such ordinance in the Code and
shall be indexed accordingly therein. Until such Code is prepared, adopted and
distributed, the Village Recorder shall make available to any person requesting
it, at a cost to be fixed by Council, copies of all presently effective Village
ordinances and all ordinances which may be subsequently adopted.
SECTION 3.14 INVESTIGATIONS; POWER TO CONDUCT.
   Council shall have power to conduct investigations of the operation of any
office, department, division, agency or board administering the affairs of the
Village and of any subject upon which it may legislate. Council shall have
power to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses and compel the production of
records pertinent to any investigation conducted pursuant to this section of
the Charter.
SECTION 3.15 IMPEACHMENT POWERS.
   Council shall have authority to initiate impeachment proceedings, by
resolution, against the Mayor, members of Council or against any appointee of
the Mayor, by a two-thirds vote of the members of Council. A three-fourths vote
of the members of Council shall be required to convict any person so impeached.
Conviction under this section shall be grounds for removal from office in
accordance with the provisions of this Charter or general law. In the event an
impeachment resolution is adopted by Council, as specified herein, it shall
state with clarity and particularity each offense of which the person is
accused, in terms sufficient to constitute due and proper notice to such person
of the nature of the offense or offenses charged. Such impeachment resolution
shall be directed to the officer or person named therein and shall require such
officer and person to appear for a hearing before the Village Council on a
specific day named in the resolution of impeachment. A true copy of such
resolution shall be served upon such officer or person at least twenty days
prior to the date scheduled for such hearing in the manner in which a summons
commencing a civil suit may be served.
SECTION 3.16 HEARINGS ON IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTIONS.
   (a)   On the day specified for hearing on any impeachment resolution, the
Village Council shall convene for the purpose of hearing the evidence against
the officer or person named in said resolution. The Council shall proceed to
hear the charges and/or evidence in support thereof or in opposition thereto.
At the conclusion of the evidence, Council members shall vote individually
either to convict or to acquit on the impeachment resolution except that if the
officer or person being tried is also a member of Council, his or her vote
shall not be cast or counted either for or against impeachment. In the event a
majority of the votes are cast for the impeachment of the officer or person, he
or she shall thereupon be removed from office.
   (b)   In the event the Village Council votes for impeachment and removes
such officer or person from office pursuant to this section, an appeal may be
taken from such action to the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia,
within thirty days from the date of the vote convicting such officer or person
under the impeachment resolution. The Circuit Court of Cabell County shall
consider and decide the appeal upon the original papers and documents without
requiring the same to be printed and shall enforce its findings and decisions
by proper writ.
   (c)   If a Municipal officer or employee be removed from office under this
section, the Village Council shall have full power and authority to fill the
vacancy in such office and position by a temporary appointment until a final
decision of the matter. When a final decision has been made by the Circuit
Court of Cabell County, West Virginia, or by such other court having
jurisdiction, then the Village Council shall fill such vacancy in the manner
provided by law for such office or position.
SECTION 3.17 APPOINTMENTS; CONSENT AND APPROVAL; AUTHORITY OF VILLAGE COUNCIL.
   Wherever in this Charter provision is made for an appointment to be made by
the Mayor subject to the consent and approval of the Council and the Mayor
fails, neglects or refuses to make such appointment, the Council shall have the
right and discretion to make such appointment by the affirmative vote of five
(5) of its members acting on such appointment at any regular meeting of the
Council or at any special meeting called for the purpose of acting on such
appointment; provided, however, that Council shall not make such appointment
without first giving to the Mayor fourteen (14) calendar days' notice to make
the appointment prior to such meeting. Wherever in this Charter provision is
made for an appointment to be made by the Mayor subject to the consent and
approval of the Council, and the Mayor shall twice make such appointment for
the same position or office, and the Council shall twice decline such
appointment or twice withhold its consent and approval of such appointment,
then Council shall have the right and discretion to make such appointment by
the affirmative vote of five (5) of its members voting on such appointment at a
regular meeting of the Council or at a special meeting called for the purpose
of considering the same.

107.01 PURCHASING OF SUPPLIES, MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES.
   (a)   The Director of Finance for the Municipality shall make all purchases
of supplies, materials, equipment and services as authorized by Council in the
manner prescribed by this article and subject to the limitations imposed by the
Charter and general law.
   (b)   All purchases of supplies, materials, equipment and services shall be
pursuant to a written requisition from the head of the office, department or
agency whose appropriation will be charged therewith, and such supplies,
materials, equipment and services shall conform with specifications approved,
established and enforced by the Director of Finance.
   (c)   No purchase order shall be issued or contract executed nor shall any
other agreement purporting to obligate the Municipality be entered into without
a written approval signed by the Finance Director, that there is sufficient
unencumbered appropriation and allotment balance to cover the obligation.
   (d)   Pursuant to the Charter, before the Director of Finance shall make any
purchase of, or contract for supplies, materials or equipment, he shall give
ample opportunity for competitive bidding under the general rules and
regulations herein prescribed and with such further regulations and exceptions
as Council may hereafter prescribe; nothing herein contained shall be construed
as excepting individual contracts, purchases or sales from the requirement of
competitive bidding, as required by the Charter. All such purchases, or the
contracts for such purchases, shall be awarded to the lowest and best
responsible bidder; providing, however, that any or all bids may be rejected in
the manner and form prescribed in this article.
   (e)   Split bidding is prohibited. The practice of "split bidding" is hereby
defined to be the device of submitting multiple requisitions for the same
supplies, materials, equipment or services where the sum of the cost of the
several requisitions is equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, and
splitting the department's requirements into several requisitions would thereby
avoid the necessity for the Municipality to require competitive sealed bids.
The practice of "split bidding" is hereby declared to be improper, illegal and
against the public interest, and head of the office, department or agency shall
state on each requisition that such requisition represents the entire quantity
presently known to be required and that the requisition is not a part of a
device or scheme to avoid the purchasing procedure of the Municipality.
   (f)   The Municipality may withold payment on any vendor or contractor who
is in default on the payment of any taxes, licenses, fees or other moneys of
whatever nature that may be due the Municipality by such vendor or contractor.
   (g)   Pursuant to the provisions of the Charter, any capital improvements or
repairs costing more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or any series of
capital improvements or repairs constituting essentially a single project and
costing in the aggregate more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be
executed by contract except where such improvement is authorized by Council to
be executed directly by the Mayor in conformity with detailed plans,
specifications and estimates. All such contracts shall be awarded to the lowest
responsible bidder after such public notice and competitive bidding as
prescribed herein, and after a public opening of bids as likewise provided
herein. Alterations in any contract may be made when authorized by Council upon
the written recommendation of the Mayor.
   (h)   Notice inviting bids shall be published as a Class I legal
advertisement. Such notice shall include a general description of the article
to be purchased, shall state where bid blanks and written specifications may be
secured, and the time and place for opening bids. Additional notice of such
invitation to bid shall be posted on public bulletin boards in the Municipal
Building.
   (i)   Bids shall be submitted sealed to the Village Recorder and shall be
identified as bids on the envelope. Such bids shall be opened in public and in
the presence of at least three persons, including a representative from the
Director of Finance and Village Recorder's office and at the time and place
stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids so received shall be
posted on bulletin boards in the Municipal Building for public inspection.
   (j)   Pursuant to the guidelines herein set out, Council shall have and
hereby is granted the authority to reject any or all bids, parts of all bids or
all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services included in the
proposed contract.
   (k)   When deemed necessary bid deposits shall be prescribed and noted in
the public notices inviting bids. The deposit shall be in such amount as the
Purchasing Agent shall determine and unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to
return of the deposit where such has been required. A successful bidder shall
forfeit any required deposit upon failure on his part to enter a contract
within ten days after the award, if a specified time is not stated in the bid
specifications.
   (l)   The Director of Finance shall require evidence of payment and
performance bonds secured by a surety company authorized to do business in the
State before entering a contract. The bonds shall be such amount as the
Director of Finance shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best
interests of the Municipality.
   (m)   Notwithstanding the procedures as are set out in this article, the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized with prior approval of the Department
of Finance and Administration of the State to purchase supplies and equipment
for the City pursuant to West Virginia Code 8-12-10, when it was deemed that
such purchase will result in a substantial savings to the Municipality.
(A.O.)
   (n)   Council shall not enact any blanket authorization sanctioning or
approving in advance the making of purchases in excess of the sum of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000). Purchases in excess of that sum, either separately
or in the aggregate, shall not be undertaken without a specific Council
resolution approving such purchase or purchases.

111.01 FINDINGS OF FACT; ADOPTION OF STATE LAW.
   (a)   Council hereby finds that the purposes of the West Virginia
Governmental Ethics Act have reasonable, necessary and appropriate application
to matters involving all elected and appointed municipal officials and
employees, whether full or part time, who derive a salary, payment of wages or
other direct remuneration from the Municipality, and does now hereby affirm,
ratify and adopt such State defined purposes as being the same purposes of this
Municipal Government Ethics Article, without specifically republishing such
State purposes herein.
   (b)   Council further hereby finds that for the purpose of assisting in the
administration of the provisions of this article, that various statutory
sections of the aforesaid State Act shall be hereby expressly adopted and
incorporated as provisions of this article, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, and which State statutory sections specifically hereby adopted
and incorporated herein are as follows:
      (1)   Sections 6B-1-1 through 5; and
      (2)   Section 6B-2-5.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the affirmation and adoption of the purposes of the
State Act and further the specific adoption of the selected, statutory sections
which were immediately hereinbefore set forth in subsection (b) hereof, Council
specifically finds that certain statutory provisions of the aforesaid State Act
are either inapplicable to the administration of this article or would
otherwise be unduly burdensome for the Village to require and administer, and
specifically, Council finds that the purposes of the State Act and of this
article can be effectively executed at the municipal level without the specific
adoption and incorporation of the statutory provisions of West Virginia Code
6B-2-6 and 6B-2-7, as amended, respecting financial disclosure, and West
Virginia Code Article 6B-3 relating to regulation and registration of
lobbyists, and which statutory provisions Council hereby expressly opts not to
include as provisions of this article, and affirmatively elects that such
provisions shall not apply to this Municipality and its officers and employees.
(Ord. 89-05. Passed 6-28-89.)
111.02 AMENDMENTS TO STATE STATUTES.
   Any amendment to any of the aforesaid statutory provisions of the State
which are expressly herein adopted and incorporated as provisions of this
article, shall upon enactment by the State Legislature, pursuant to the State

unless the Village expressly opts not to adopt any such amendment by ordinance
duly adopted by Council evidencing the non-adoption of such amendments.

   (a)   The prospective buyer of a parcel of real property owned by the
Village shall, as a prerequisite to a sale and conveyance of such property,
provide the Village with a current professional property appraisal, by a
Village selected appraiser, as well as a metes and bounds survey and map which
adequately describes the property in question. The property, if sold, should be
sold at its appraised value plus the cost of appraisal, but in no event shall
the sale price be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and the cost of the
appraisal shall be an additional amount due the Village from the prospective
buyer.
   (b)   Each proposed sale of Village real property shall be handled on a
case-by-case basis. If two or more parties are interested in purchasing the
same parcel of property, and the parties cannot agree between themselves as to
the division or sale of the property, the property shall not be sold to any
party at that time.
   A request for the purchase of such a parcel of real property shall be made
to Council. Council, in considering such request, shall give great weight to
potential public use of the property, shall submit such request to the Planning
Commission and shall cause the matter to be given public notice, as a Class I
legal advertisement, the cost to be borne by the prospective purchaser.
   The guidelines of this section are in addition to any other limitations or
requirements imposed on the sale of municipally owned real property, contained
in either Village or State statutes, including West Virginia Code 8-11-3(6) and

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o'clock p.m. and six o'clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.
(WVaC 17C-3-9)
313.08 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES.
   (a)   Where street or highway construction work is being conducted, signs
and other traffic control devices, as adopted in West Virginia Code 17C-3-1,
shall be posted giving the location of the work and notifying all motorists as
to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this
section.

license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions

10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and

section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.

this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,

defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision

commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

subsection, whether as a term of probation or not, shall be distributed as

public recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of
persons or property.

misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

361.22 PARKING IN RESTRICTED RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
   Whenever the Mayor, or the Chief of Police, determines that certain streets
within the Municipality are being used for parking by the operators of vehicles
who are not residents of such street and such parking is impeding the flow of
commuter traffic thereby causing hazardous traffic conditions in such areas and
causing the residents of the areas unreasonable burdens in gaining access to
their residences and is polluting the air and causing excessive noise, the
Mayor or Chief of Police shall cause appropriate signs to be erected
prohibiting and restricting all parking on such street except parking by the
holders of permits such permits to be granted only under the following
conditions:
   (a)   To persons who are residents of any particular area in which parking
is so prohibited or restricted, to be limited to that particular area in which
parking is so restricted or prohibited for every vehicle owned by those persons
who are residents;
   (b)   To persons who are visitors of any residents of any particular street
or area in which parking is so restricted or prohibited;

deliveries to residents in such area or on such street.
      On the application of any resident of the area or street where such
parking is restricted or prohibited, the Mayor or Chief of Police may issue
permits authorizing parking in the area or on the street upon the showing by
the resident that his residence will be used in such a way consistent with its
residential character and other provisions of law that visitors to his
residence would not be able to park without violating the law. If the Mayor or
Chief of Police finds the foregoing facts and further finds that the issuance
of a permit will not unduly impair traffic safety, he shall issue such permits.
      When official signs are erected as provided herein, no person shall stop,
stand or park a vehicle in any such designated area or street, without first
obtaining the required permit.

responsibility requirements.
   (c)   A person may not tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to
change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-
assist and throttle-assist types of engagement. If a motor on an electric

subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle operated solely
and exclusively on a person’s own property.

trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given
the same rights and privileges of a traditional, non-electric bicycle and will

rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related

traditional or non-electric bicycles are allowed. For example, electric
bicycles will not be allowed on roads or trails or in areas where traditional,
non-electric bicycle travel is prohibited.

owner of a private way or the owner of private property to restrict or allow
the operation of electric bicycles on the way or property.

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "delinquency" means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
 
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
 
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
 
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
 
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
 
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
 
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of

reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed shoplifting, may
detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable
detention shall not constitute an arrest nor shall it render the owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, liable to the person detained.

hundred dollars ($100.00) the defendant shall be fined not less than thirty-
five dollars ($35.00) nor more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
         B.   When the value of the merchandise exceeds one hundred dollars

hundred dollars ($100.00) the defendant shall be fined not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and
such fine shall not be suspended.
         B.   When the value of the merchandise exceeds one hundred dollars
($100.00), the defendant shall be fined not less than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00).
      (3)   Mandatory penalty. In addition to the fines imposed by this
section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of shoplifting, the court
shall order the defendant to pay a penalty to the mercantile establishment
involved in the amount of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00), or double the
value of the merchandise involved, whichever is higher. The mercantile
establishment shall be entitled to collect such mandatory penalty as in the
case of a civil judgment. This penalty shall be in addition to the mercantile

      (4)   Attorney fees. In addition to the costs authorized or required by
state law to be assessed and collected in such criminal proceedings or
otherwise imposed by this section, in all cases of conviction for the offense
of shoplifting wherein the Municipality has engaged legal counsel to prosecute
the case, the court shall order the defendant to pay a reasonable attorney fee
to the Municipality of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than

      (5)   Prior convictions. In determining the number of prior shoplifting

the shoplifting offense in question.
   (f)   Civil Liability.
      (1)   General rule. Any person who commits any of the acts described in
this section shall be civilly liable:
         A.   To restore the merchandise to the mercantile establishment; and
         B.   If such merchandise is not recoverable or is damaged, for actual
damages, including the value of the merchandise involved in the shoplifting;

a civil action authorized by this section is entitled to costs and reasonable
attorney fees.
      (3)   Effect of conviction. A conviction for the offense of theft by
shoplifting is not a prerequisite to the maintenance of a civil action
authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (e) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not
limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.

such replica is not designed or redesigned to use rimfire or conventional
centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade; and
      (3)   Any muzzle-loading rifle, muzzle-loading shotgun, or muzzle-loading
pistol, which is designed to use black powder, or black powder substitute, and
which cannot use fixed ammunition. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
“antique firearm” shall not include any weapon which includes a firearm frame
or receiver, any firearm which is converted into a muzzle-loading weapon, or
any muzzle-loading weapon which can be readily converted to fire fixed
ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, breechblock, or any combination

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent
disclosure or recognition. A deadly weapon is concealed when it is carried on

of events would not be placed on notice that the deadly weapon was being
carried. For purposes of concealed handgun licensees, a licensee is considered
to be carrying on or about his or her person while in or on a motor vehicle if
the firearm is located in a storage area in or on the motor vehicle.

radiological materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
the term “deadly weapon” does not include any item or material owned by the
school or county board, intended for curricular use, and used by the student at
the time of the alleged offense solely for curricular purposes. The term
“deadly weapon” does not include pepper spray as defined in subsection (l)

limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and
one-half inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any
other instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. A

recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

tax imposed by this article for any tax year, in which the taxpayer’s gross
income, as defined in Section
733.01(f), is less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00).
   This exemption shall apply on a prospective basis only and shall not affect
liability for any tax periods ending prior to July 1, 2025.
   For purposes of this section, the term “gross income” shall be interpreted
consistently with Section
733.01 of this article and includes all receipts and values accruing to the
taxpayer from engaging in business, without deduction.
   If necessary for administration, the Collector may require such taxpayer to
file a declaration indicating qualification for this exemption.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
733.14 COMPUTATION OF TAX; PAYMENT.
   The taxes levied hereunder shall be due and payable in quarterly
installments on or before the expiration of one month from the end of the
quarter in which they accrue. The taxpayer shall, within one month from the
expiration of each quarter, make out a return upon a form prescribed by the
Collector, showing the gross proceeds of sale, or gross income of business
trade or calling and compute the amount of the tax for which he is liable for
such quarter and sign and mail the same, together with a remittance in the form
as required by this article for the amount of the tax to the office of the
Collector. In reporting and remitting the amount of the tax, interest and
penalties due for each quarter, the taxpayer may deduct the credit allowed by
Section
733.13 of this article. The Collector may allow return and payment under this
section for periods other than quarterly periods. On or before thirty-one (31)
days after the end of the tax year, each person liable for the payment of tax
under this article shall make a fourth quarter return, showing the gross
proceeds of sale or gross income of business, trade, calling or activity,
computing the amount of tax, interest and penalty chargeable against the person
in accordance with the provisions of this article and transmit with the return
a remittance in the sum required by this article, covering the remainder of the
tax, interest and penalty chargeable against the person for the tax year, to
such location or locations specified by the Collector. Such returns shall be
verified by the oath of the taxpayer, if made by an individual, or by the
individual designated by a taxpayer that is an entity to take the oath on
behalf of the taxpayer. Such return shall contain a statement as deemed
acceptable to the Collector, such as:
   "I declare under penalties of perjury, that this return (including any
accompanying schedules and statements) has been examined by me and to the best
of my knowledge and belief, is a true, correct and complete return."
   The Collector, if he deems it necessary to insure payment of the tax, may
require return and payment under this section for other than quarterly periods.
If for any reason it is not practicable for the individual taxpayer to sign the
same, the signature may be by any duly authorized agent.
   A person whose gross income for a tax year is less than two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00), as described in Section
733.13A, shall not be liable for tax under this article but may be required to
file a return or declaration indicating such qualification, in a form
prescribed by the Collector.
   Furthermore, the Collector, if he deems it necessary to insure payment of
the tax, may require a deposit to be paid by the Taxpayer prior to when the
taxes accrue and are otherwise payable pursuant to this article. The amount of
the deposit shall be determined and/or based upon the taxpayer's projected
gross income or gross proceeds of sale for the applicable tax period. This
deposit shall be paid to the office of the Collector, at a date and time, and
in a manner determined by the Collector. (Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
733.15 ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   If the taxpayer shall make any clerical or mathematical error which shall be
apparent on
the face of the return in computing the tax assessable against him, the
Collector shall correct such error or reassess the proper amount of taxes and
notify the taxpayer of his action by mailing him promptly a copy of the
corrected assessment; and any additional tax for which such taxpayer may be
liable shall be paid within fifteen days after the receipt of such statement.
If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the
basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon his request to the Collector, who shall pay same
to taxpayer out of any funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at
his election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing
hereunder.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
733.16 ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Collector believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed to
properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and
make an assessment therefor.
   The Collector may, at any time before the assessment becomes final, amend,
in whole or in part, any assessment whenever the Collector ascertains that such
assessment is improper or incomplete in any material respect. The Collector
may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment, make a
supplemental assessment whenever the Collector ascertains that any assessment
is incorrect in any material respect.
   The amount of tax, interest and penalties imposed by this article shall be
assessed within three (3) years after the date the fourth quarter return for
the year in which such tax arose is filed by the taxpayer; provided, that in
the case of a false or fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade the tax
or in case no return is filed, an assessment may be made at any time.
   Assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer either personally or by
certified mail, return receipt requested.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
733.17 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   If the Collector believes that the collection of any tax which he is
required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make an
assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment. The amount
assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer against whom
a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within twenty days
after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an assessment becomes
final.
   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy assessment
has been made shall be accompanied by such security as the Collector deems
necessary to insure compliance with this article.
   Jeopardy assessments shall be served upon the taxpayer either personally or
by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
733.18 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; HEARING.
   The Collector shall give to the taxpayer written notice of any assessment
made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom a notice of
assessment is directed shall, within thirty days after service thereof (except
in case of jeopardy assessments) either personally or by registered mail, file
with the Collector, a petition in writing, verified under oath by the taxpayer
or his duly authorized agent, having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with
definiteness and particularity the items of the assessment objected to,
together with the reason for such objections, such assessments shall become and
be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall be payable at the end of the
thirty-day period.
   In every case where a petition for reassessment as above described is filed,
the Collector shall assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall
notify the petitioner and City Attorney of such hearing by written notice at
least twenty days in advance thereof; and such hearing shall be held within
sixty days from the filing of the petition for reassessment unless continued by
written agreement of the parties, or in writing by the Collector or hearing
examiner designated by the Collector for good cause. The hearing shall be
informal and may be conducted by the Collector or by an examiner designated by
the Collector. Any designated hearing examiner shall be a licensed attorney
with experience in administrative law or tax law, or with experience as a
judge, including the sitting municipal judge. If the Collector desires to
designate the municipal judge as the hearing examiner, the Collector shall
first confirm that the municipal judge does not have a conflict of interest
with respect to the taxpayer and that the municipal judge is able to meet the
time requirements contained in this section as part of, and without detriment
to, the other ongoing duties of the municipal judge. The burden of proof shall
be upon the taxpayer to show that the assessment or denial refund or credit is
incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part. The hearing examiner is not
bound by the rules of evidence as applied in civil cases in the circuit courts
of this State. The hearing examiner may admit and give probative effect to
evidence of a type commonly relied upon by a reasonably prudent person in the
conduct of his or her affairs. All testimony shall be given under oath. All
hearings shall be recorded by means acceptable for use in courts of this State.
In case of the failure or refusal of a witness to appear and testify or to
produce evidence, the hearing examiner may invoke the aid of the circuit court
of Cabell County. Upon proper showing, the hearing examiner may apply for an
order requiring the witness to appear and give testimony and produce evidence
concerning the matter in question. All parties shall receive notice that the
hearing will be recorded and that each is entitled to receive a copy of the
recording at cost. A copy of the exhibits made part of the record shall be
available to any party upon request and payment of a reasonable fee. At such
hearing, evidence may be offered to support the assessment or to prove that it
is incorrect. After the administrative hearing, the hearing examiner may
request that proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from the parties
be submitted within thirty days and the Collector or hearing examiner shall,
within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of the decision. The decision
shall be made no later than six months after the administrative hearing unless
extraordinary circumstances exist, in which case the Final Order shall disclose
such extraordinary circumstances. The Final Order shall include notice of the
right to appeal, as stated in Section 733.19, and the bonding requirements for
such an appeal.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)

the Circuit Court of Cabell County, a copy of which petition and notice shall

questions of law or questions of fact, or both, and set forth with
particularity the items of the hearing examiner's decision objected to,
together with the reasons for the objections. The filing of the appeal shall
not stay the decision of the hearing examiner. The decision of the hearing
examiner shall be stayed if the taxpayer shall file with the clerk of the
circuit court a bond for the use of the City, with sureties approved by the
Clerk, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the total amount of the tax,
interest and penalties (to such date) appealed from, and conditioned that the
taxpayer shall perform the orders of the Court; except that in lieu of such
bond, the Collector may, upon proper showing, find and certify to the clerk
that the properties of the taxpayer subject to the liens imposed by this
article are adequate to secure the performance of the orders of the Court. Upon
receipt, the Collector shall forward a complete copy of the record, including
the Final Order, transcripts/recording of the hearing, papers, motions,
documents, exhibits, evidence and records as were before the hearing examiner
or supplemented prior to the decision, to the Circuit Court, the City Attorney,
the taxpayer, and counsel of record, in a manner consistent with Rule 4 of the
West Virginia Rules of Procedure for Administrative Appeals.
   (c)    The circuit court shall hear the appeal and determine all questions
submitted to it
on appeal from the determination of the Collector or hearing examiner. In such
appeal, a certified copy of the assessment of the Collector shall be admissible
and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the provisions
of this article. The Court shall render its decree thereon; and a certified
copy of such decree shall be filed by the Clerk of such Court with the
Collector, who shall than correct the assessment in accordance with the decree.
An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer or the Collector to the Supreme Court of
Appeals of this State.

paid, a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first

each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, however,
that if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the Collector may waive or
remit in whole or in part these penalties.
   (c)    If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this
article, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be added an administrative
civil penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax, exclusive
of penalties.
   (d)    The penalty so added shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner
as a part of the tax.

person at least five (5) days prior to the contemplated revocation or denial

place of a revocation/denial review meeting, the general grounds of said
contemplated action, and shall advise the affected person of its rights to
appear at said hearing in person and represented by legal counsel, and to be
heard orally upon the merits of the person's defense. The Collector may request
legal advice from the City Attorney, and adopt such procedures for its decorum
and the dispatch of business at such hearings as the Collector may regard
advisable. The revocation decision of the Collector will be final. Each license
or permit that has been revoked or denied pursuant to this section may be
issued or re-issued upon payment of all delinquent tax, interest or penalty due

conditions otherwise imposed by the Municipality.

after the due date of the return in respect of which the tax was imposed, and
not thereafter. If, as a result of the claim, the Collector shall be of the
opinion that the tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, was overpaid,
the Collector shall refund the same to the taxpayer. If the Collector denies
the claim, the taxpayer may within thirty (30) days after notice of denial file
with the Collector a petition for refund or credit, which shall be heard in
accordance with Section
733.18 of this article. A taxpayer's failure to abide by express procedures
contained in this section precludes taxpayer's right to any refund or credit of
tax, interest and penalties paid or collected under this article.
(Ord. 2025-02. Passed 6-17-25.)
   733.38 SEVERABILITY.

   There is hereby imposed and levied upon each and every purchaser of a public
utility service an excise tax upon the privilege of purchasing, using or
consuming, within the corporate limits of this Municipality, such public
utility service. Such tax shall be in the amount of two percent (2%) of the
charge (exclusive of any Federal or State tax thereon improved upon the
purchaser) made by the seller against the purchaser with respect to each public
utility service, which tax in every case shall be collected by the seller and
paid by the purchaser upon the amount of each periodic statement rendered such
purchaser by the seller, and shall be paid by the purchaser to the seller at
the time the purchase price or such charge becomes due and payable under the
agreement between the purchaser and the seller. The tax imposed and levied by
this article is in addition to all other taxes imposed and levied by this
Municipality. In the event the amount of the charge for any single public
utility service exceeds the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in any
given calendar month, to any single purchaser, no tax shall be imposed for such
additional purchase, use or consumption in excess of such amount of twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000). In the event more than one public utility furnishes
the identical public utility service to the same purchaser, such purchaser
shall be entitled to group the same as a single public utility service in
calculating the amount of the charges in any calendar month for the public
utility service.
(Ord. 4-30-71)

purchase price charged for its public utility service, and the amount of tax
actually collected during each calendar month shall be reported by each seller
to this Municipality and each seller shall remit the amount of tax shown by
such report to have been collected to this Municipality on or before the last
day of the first calendar month following the month in which collected,
together with the name and address of any purchaser who has failed or refused
to pay the tax so imposed and levied. The tax imposed and levied by this
article shall apply to periodic statements rendered after July 1, 1971 for
public utility service rendered subsequent to July 1, 1971 and when any such
periodic statement covers public utility service rendered both before and after
such date, only that portion of the charge for public utility service rendered
after such date shall be subject to the tax, and the portion subject to the tax
shall be such portion of the total charge as the number of days after June 30,
1971, within the period coverd by such periodic statement, bear to the total
number of days covered by such periodic statement. The required reports shall
be in the form prescribed by the official of this Municipality charged with the

741.06 NONLIABILITY OF UTILITY; REFUNDS; RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   There shall be no liability upon the seller for erroneously collecting the
tax hereby imposed and levied or for erroneously failing to bill for such tax
as a result of a good faith mistake on the part of the seller. When any
purchaser contends that such tax is not owed by such purchaser on the grounds
that the public utility service was not purchased, used or consumed within the
corporate limits of this Municipality, the seller shall refer the question to
the official of this Municipality charged with the responsibility of collecting
taxes due to this Municipality, and such seller shall thereafter collect or
refrain from collecting the tax from the purchaser for such public utility
service as instructed in writing to do by such officials of this Municipality.
Any and all claims for refunds of any such tax shall be presented to this
Municipality and not to the seller.
   The official of this Municipality charged with the responsibility of

utility service purchased, used or consumed during different periodic statement
periods shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

(6%) for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all taxes
collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the taxing authority as

of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first month or fraction thereof, of

right to inspect at all reasonable times.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 10-18-88.)

operator shall immediately make a report and pay the tax due the Director.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 10-18-88.)
761.12 ASSESSMENT WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Director of Finance believes that the tax imposed by this article has
been insufficiently returned by an operator, either because the operator has
failed or refused to properly collect or remit the tax, or has failed to make a
return, or has made a return which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise
erroneous, he may proceed to investigate and determine or estimate the tax
liability of the operator and make an assessment therefor. Assessments shall be
served upon the taxpayer either personally or by certified mail.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 10-18-88.)
761.13 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT.

assessment made pursuant to this article. Unless the operator to whom a notice
of assessment is given, within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by certified mail, files with the Director a petition in writing,
verified under oath by the operator or his duly authorized agent having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for the objections, the
assessment shall become final and not subject to administrative or judicial
review. The amount of an assessment shall be due and payable on the day
following the date upon which the assessment becomes final.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 10-18-88.)

   (a)   When a petition for reassessment provided for in Section
761.13 is filed within the time prescribed in such section for such filing, the
Director of Finance shall assign a time and place of a hearing thereon and
shall notify the operator of such hearing by written notice at least twenty
days in advance thereof. Such hearing shall be held within 100 days from the
date of filing the petition unless continued by agreement of the parties or by
the Director on his own motion.
   (b)   The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial
manner by the Director or a hearing examiner designated by the Director. The
burden of proof shall be upon the operator to show that the assessment is
incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part.
   (c)   After any such hearing, the Director shall, within a reasonable time,
give notice in writing of his decision.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 10-18-88.)

County within thirty days after service of the Finance Director's decision.
   (b)   The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the Director as
an original notice. When the petition and notice are so served, they shall,
with the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the office of the Clerk of
the Circuit Court of Cabell County and docketed as other cases with the
operator as petitioner and the Director as respondent. The filing of the appeal
shall not stay the collection of the tax. The collection of the tax shall be
stayed if the plaintiff files with such Clerk a bond, for the use of the
respondent, with sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the bond to be
not less than the total amount of the tax, interest and penalties, to such
date, appealed from and conditioned that the petitioner shall perform the
orders of the Court; provided, that a judge of the Circuit Court may stay the
collection of the tax without the requirement of a bond upon a proper showing
by the operator that the properties of the operator are sufficient to secure
performance of the Court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served
thereby.
   (c)   The Court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions
submitted to it on appeal from the determination of the Director. In such
appeal, a certified copy of the Director's assessment shall be admissible and
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the provisions of

after having been served with notice to do so, to put down a suitable curb of
concrete or other material along and for the footways and sidewalks of any of
the streets or alleys of the Municipality, or fail to lay, relay or repair any
sidewalks and gutters in, on or along any of such streets or alleys, or to
plant, replant and care for shade trees along any of such streets or alleys, at
such points, and in such manner as Council may have determined, or fail to keep
such sidewalks clean and in good repair, or to grade the plot of ground on

or noxious, such work may be done by the Municipality, or Council may let such
work to contract. In either case, the total cost of the work or such part
thereof, as Council may direct or determine, shall be charged and assessed upon
and against the land, lots or parts of lots abutting or fronting upon any of
such streets or alleys, which assessment shall be and remain a lien upon such
land, lots or parts of lots, the same as taxes levied upon real estate in the
Municipality, which may be enforced by a suit in equity before any court having
jurisdiction, as other liens against real estate are enforced, and shall also
be a debt against the owners or occupiers of such land, lots or parts of lots,
which may be collected as other debts are collected, in any court having
jurisdiction, and shall be due and payable in ninety days from the completion
and acceptance of such work as certified to by Council, with six percent (6%)
interest thereon from the date of such record acceptance, and in addition
thereto, such cost or expense, with interest at six percent (6%), may be
collected from the owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee, by distress or
sale in the same manner in which taxes levied against real estate are herein
authorized to be collected. The costs or expenses with interest thereon at six
percent (6%) for such work as may remain unpaid at the time of the making out
of tax tickets, covering the taxes due in any year by such owners of such lots
or lands, shall be placed on the tax tickets for that year along with the
statement of other taxes due by such owners, and the Director of Finance shall
collect such amounts at the time and in the manner as other Municipal taxes are
collected by him from such owner, without allowing any discount thereon, and
upon failure to pay the same on or before the last day of that year, there
shall be added thereto the same interest penalties as are provided for the
failure to pay other taxes assessed at such time against such owners. The
Director, upon the failure to pay such amounts, shall return the real estate,
against which such amount is a lien, delinquent for the nonpayment of taxes for
such year the same as in the case of returning such lands delinquent for the
nonpayment of other taxes assessed against such owner, and the real estate may
be sold, at the time and in the manner provided for in the case of delinquent
lands for the nonpayment of taxes.
   In ascertaining the amount to be assessed upon or against any corner lot for
the cost or expense of doing or causing to be done, any of the work herein
mentioned, Council may assess the total cost of such work in front or alongside
such lot and extended to the curb or gutter of the intersections of the streets
or alleys at that point.
909.07 COLLECTION OF ASSESSMENTS FOR WORK DONE BY MUNICIPALITY.
   When work is done by the Municipality under Section
909.06 and is not let to contract, Council shall certify such assessments to
the Director of Finance for collection, who shall account for the same in the
same manner as he accounts for Municipal taxes, and the Director shall accept
payment, when tendered, of the amount of such assessment with interest to the
date of payment, and unless the assessment is paid within ninety days from the
date of such assessment, then a copy of such report shall be certified by the
Village Recorder to the County Clerk, who shall record and index the same in
the proper trust deed book in the name of each person against whose property
assessments appear thereon. If any such assessment is not paid when due,
Council shall cause to be enforced the payment of such assessment and interest,
in all respects as herein provided, which such assessment shall be a lien on
the property liable therefor the same as taxes, and shall have priority over
all other liens except those for taxes due the State and the County, and shall
be on a parity with taxes or assessments due the Municipality. When such
assessment is paid in full, and a lien therefor is of record in the County
Clerk's office, the Director of Finance shall execute and deliver to the owner
of the property a release of the lien, which may be recorded in the office of
the County Clerk as other releases of lien are recorded.
909.08 SUPERVISION OF WORK DONE.
   All work done under Section
909.06 whether done by the Municipality direct or through contractors, shall be

alleys at the points and in the manner as Council may have determined, or fails

on either side of such sidewalks between the street curb and property line, and
to keep the same sodded with grass and free from weeds and obstructions and

lots abutting or fronting upon such streets or alleys of the Municipality free

existing sewer line shall be broken on the structure side of such sewage
disposal system or device, and attachment shall be made, with proper fittings,
to continue such sewer line as a customer service line. The Board may, at its
discretion, permit the utilization of an existing sewer line provided an
inspection discloses that it is reasonably true to grade and alignment and in
good condition. In case of an existing sewer line utilizing a type of sewer
pipe not specified herein, the Board shall have the right to require the owner
to uncover the full extent of the pipe to determine its condition and may
require its replacement with approved pipe as outlined herein, if the
inspection discloses such pipe to be deteriorated in any manner. The cost of
replacing the pipe where necessary shall be the sole responsibility of the
owner thereof.

   (d)   The following is applicable for all new and existing food service
establishments discharging fats, oils and grease into the sanitary sewer
system. Grease, oil and sand separators shall be provided by the entity causing
the discharge when, in the opinion of the Board, they are necessary for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive
amounts as specified in subsection (c), or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the Board and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
inspection and cleaning. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and
maintained as needed by the respective entity at their expense. The Board shall
require any restaurant, café, fast food chain, cafeteria, or other business
discharging grease or kitchen waste into the sewer system which would interfere
or be incompatible with the waste treatment works to install grease traps/
interceptors. Such interceptors shall not be required for private living
quarters or dwelling units. Failure to comply with this policy shall be
considered a violation of this Sewer Use Article and will be subject to
applicable penalties, fines or discontinuance of water and sewer service.
      (1)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers, which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and
watertight. Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at
all times.
      (2)   Any food service establishment, whose grease trap discharge is
found to contain floating oil and grease, may be required by the Board to
sample and test their grease trap discharge. The owner shall furnish a copy of
the test results to the Board for evaluation. All measurements, tests, and
analysis referred to in this article shall be determined in accordance with the
latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association. The cost of
sampling and analysis shall be at the expense of the owner. If the results of
the analysis indicate an oil or grease concentration in excess of 500 mg/l, the
Board will issue the owner a notice of violation.
      (3)   All grease traps/interceptors shall be designed, installed and
located in accordance with the West Virginia State Plumbing Code, International
Plumbing Code, and the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health.
      (4)   The plans, specifications and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Board for review and comment. The Board will review the plans
within sixty days and recommend any revisions or additions. The owner shall
secure all necessary building, plumbing permits, etc. required by the Board or
state agencies. The user shall construct or install the system within the time
limit provided by the Board. Upon completion of construction the owner shall
provide the Board with “As-Built” drawings.
      (5)   All construction and/or installation must be accomplished utilizing
properly licensed plumbing/utility contractors.
      (6)   All existing food service establishments shall have grease traps/
interceptors approved by the Board. Food service establishments without these
facilities will be given a compliance deadline not to exceed ninety days from
the date of notification.
      (7)   New food service establishments shall be required to install below
ground grease interceptors that are sized to provide adequate grease retention
capacity. Sizing will be determined in accordance with applicable plumbing
codes and EPA guidelines. If new or existing facilities are limited by space or
other constraints and cannot feasibly install a typical below ground
interceptor, an “under-the-counter” grease interceptor may be installed with
the Board’s approval. Sizing will be determined in accordance with UPA and
local guidelines.
      (8)   Wastewater from dishwashers, garbage grinders and toilet facilities
should not be discharged to grease traps/interceptors.
      (9)   Owners will ensure that each grease trap/interceptor is serviced
frequently so that there is not overflow into the sewer system, ground or
waters of the state. Servicing will be determined when the discharge is
determined to be at or above discharge limits, approximately thirty-three
percent (33%) of the retention capacity.
      (10)   The only acceptable method of cleaning the grease trap/interceptor
shall be to pump out the grease for disposal by a licensed waste disposal firm.
The use of chemicals, solvents, etc. in lieu of physical cleaning is
prohibited.
      (11)   The owner will be required to maintain an inspection/service log.
The log should include daily maintenance, disposal, contracts and inspections.
The log shall be posted in a conspicuous location in each establishment and be
made available for review. The owner will also be required to maintain records
a minimum of two years.
      (12)   Facilities will be periodically inspected by the Board. Any
deficiencies will be noted and provided to the owner, along with a schedule for
compliance. Additional inspections to ensure compliance will be at the owner’s
expense or as determined by the Board. Receipt of a second notice of deficiency
for the same violation will result in a fine as determined by the Board in
addition to any costs incurred as a result of the deficiency. Examples of
additional costs would include but are not limited to, pumping, disposal of
grease, sewer line and manhole cleaning, etc.
      (13)   Deficiencies/violations include but are not limited to: failure to
install an approved grease trap/interceptor, unauthorized discharges or waste
which is allowed to spill, overflow, or be discharged onto public or private
property, removal or disposal of waste from a facility by a nonlicensed waste
disposal firm, etc.
   (e)   No statement contained in this article shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the governing body and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Village for treatment.

929.12 ADMISSION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (a)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewer
system any industrial wastes except upon application to the Sanitary Board and
upon receipt of a written permit therefor. An industrial waste permit shall be
in addition to any other permit required for connection to the sewer system.
There is no fee required for an industrial waste permit.
   (b)   Any person desiring to make or use a connection to the sewer system
through which industrial wastes will be discharged into the sewer system shall
file with the Board an industrial wastes questionnaire, to be furnished by the
Village, which shall supply pertinent data, including estimated quantity, flow
characteristics and constituents, with respect to the industrial wastes.
   (c)   Any person who discharges industrial wastes into the sewer system,
when required by the Board, shall construct and thereafter properly maintain at
his own expense, a suitable and accessible control manhole and other devices as
may be approved by the Board to facilitate observation, accurate measurement
and sampling by the Board of industrial waste discharges.
   (d)   Any improved property discharging industrial wastes into the sewer
system and contemplating a change in the method of operation which will alter
the characteristics and/or volumes of wastes at the time being discharged into
the sewer system shall notify the Board, in writing, at least sixty days prior
to consummation of such change. The Board reserves the right to require
improved properties having large variations in rates of waste discharge to
install suitable regulating devices for equalizing waste flows to the sewer
system.
   (e)   The governing body reserves the right to impose surcharges on sewer
user charges and/or impose other requirements in connection with any high-
strength or industrial waste discharged into the sewer system by agreement with
the owner of the improved property, in accordance with the methods described in
this article or by modification or alterations to this article as may be
acceptable to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and/or require the pretreatment
of such industrial waste at the expense of such owner.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 7-5-22.)
929.13 CHANGE IN CUSTOMER.
   Each sewer service permit applicant shall give written notice to the Village

929.14 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   Any customer desiring discontinuance of sewer service due to the vacancy of
his premises shall make application therefor directly to the Sanitary Board.
Only premises which are both vacant and have had the water supply shut off for
one or more complete monthly billing periods are eligible for exoneration from
sewer user charges. No exoneration shall be granted for less than one full
month. In the case of premises with private water supply facilities, such
application shall be supported by an affidavit to the effect that such water
supply has been shut off. Application for exoneration shall be made at least
five days in advance of the beginning of discontinuance of service. In all
cases involving water service from the Village, such service shall not be
restored until the owner of the improved property has paid the necessary charge
for the reinstallation of the water meter and opening of the water service
line.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 7-5-22.)
929.15 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or
equipment which is a part of the Village wastewater facilities.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 7-5-22.)
   929.16  DOMESTIC WASTEWATER AND WASTEWATER QUALITY, GENERAL PROHIBITIONS.
   All users will only discharge to the sewer system domestic wastewater. No
user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the Village sewer system
any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These
general prohibitions apply to all such users whether or not they are subject to
categorical pretreatment standards or other national, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements. No user will deliver industrial or non-
domestic wastewater without the consent of the Village. No user shall
maliciously, willfully or negligently introduce or cause to be introduced any
hazardous noxious material, or pollutant to the sewer system that constitutes a

   929.17 DISCHARGE OF STORM WATER RUNOFF TO SANITARY SEWERS, TESTING AND
INSPECTION AUTHORIZED, SURCHARGES.
   The discharge of storm water runoff to sanitary sewers is prohibited and
persons presently discharging storm water runoff to sanitary sewers shall cease
and desist such practice. All persons connecting to the public sanitary
sewerage system shall provide adequate means for excluding storm runoff in the
event connection is made to sanitary sewers.
   The Sanitary Board may establish by smoke testing, dye testing, on-site
inspections, or such other reasonable means, that rain or surface water is
being introduced into the sanitary sewer.
   If the Sanitary Board establishes that rain or surface water is being
introduced into the sanitary sewer and that the customer has been notified of
the violation pursuant to Section
929.18 to divert this discharge from the sanitary sewer, the volume of the
resulting rain and/or surface water shall be measured or estimated from the
total monthly rainfall times the total drainage area in square feet. To the
extent permitted by law, the Sanitary Board may adopt charges and fees to
assess the customer a surcharge for the resulting volume of discharge at the
current base service rate, provided the applicable charges and fees are set
forth in the Sanitary Board’s schedule of charges and fees. (Ord. 2022-05.
Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.18 ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE OF VIOLATION(S).
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the Sanitary Board or the Sanitary Board
Director determines after reasonable observation or investigation that a person

SHOW CAUSE HEARINGS; COMPLIANCE ORDERS, CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Unless the person to whom the notice of violation is given shall
within thirty days after service thereof file with the Sanitary Board Director
a request for reconsideration, the notice of violation shall become final and
not subject to administrative or judicial review. A request for reconsideration
must be in writing verified under oath by the person or his duly authorized
agent having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items
of the notice of violation objected to, together with the reasons for the
objections. The request for reconsideration may be served to the Village
Sanitary Board Director by mailing said request to, Village of Barboursville,
Sanitary Board Director/MS4 Manager, P.O. Box 266, Barboursville, WV 25504 or
by hand delivering said request to the Village of Barboursville Sanitary Board
Director, 721 Central Avenue, Barboursville, WV 255.04. Upon receipt of a
properly filed request for reconsideration, the Sanitary Board shall assign a
time and a place for the person requesting a reconsideration to appear before
the Board and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for
the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
requesting that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the person. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.
   (b)   The Board may conduct the show cause hearing and receive the evidence,
or may designate a hearing examiner to:
      (1)   Issue in the name of the Board notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in any such hearings;
      (2)   Receive the evidence and testimony from witnesses; and/or

transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or
any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges.
   (d)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
(1) uphold the notice of violation (2) reverse the notice of violation or (3)
modify the notice of violation and (4) issue such further orders and directives
as are necessary and appropriate. When the Board finds that a person has
violated, or continues to violate any provision of this article and upholds the
notice of violation or modifies the notice of violation, the Board may order
and direct that the person come into compliance within a specified time. Orders
may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer system or to cease and remove
illicit connections to the sewer system. An order does not relieve the person
of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of
an order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the person. The order shall be served by certified mail to the
parties within thirty days from completion of the hearing unless otherwise
mutually agreed to by the parties. An administrative appeal of the order may be
taken by any party including by the Village in the Circuit Court of Cabell
County if it has jurisdiction or to the West Virginia Intermediate Court of
Appeals within sixty days after service of the Board’s Administrative decision
to the parties.
   (e)   Civil Penalties. To the extent permitted by law, when the Board finds
that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
article and upholds the notice of violation or modifies the notice of
violation, the Board may order that the person shall be liable to the Board for
a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000), but not less than
five hundred dollars ($500.00). For the purposes of this section, each day on
which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct offense. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge
limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   (f)   After sixty days of service of the Board’s decision upholding or
modifying a notice of violation, and if no appeal has been taken, the person
shall submit a progress report to the Sanitary Board Director demonstrating
compliance with the order.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.20  ENFORCEMENT MEASURES FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   If a notice of violation has not been corrected, and no request for
reconsideration made, no court appeal filed, or no consent order entered as
provided in Section
929.21, the Sanitary Board Director shall request the owner’s permission for
access to the subject private property to take any and all measures reasonably
necessary to abate the violation and/or bring the property into compliance; and
all associated costs will be due and payable to the Sanitary Board, which shall
be a debt due the Sanitary Board and shall constitute a lien on the real and
personal property of the person(s) responsible for noncompliance. Such lien
shall be filed in the same manner as provided by Section
929.09. If refused access to the subject property, the Village may seek an
order in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the
property to abate the violation and/or bring the property into compliance. In
any proceeding under this section, upon judgment or decree for the
municipality, the Village shall be awarded its costs to abate the violation and
bring the property into compliance and any court costs and attorney fees.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.21 CONSENT ORDERS; SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND COMPROMISES.
   The Sanitary Board Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by such person to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Section
929.19 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.22  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT MEASURES.
   In addition to, and not in lieu of, any other enforcement remedies provided
in this article, the Village may pursue the following:
   (a)   Legal Action. If any person violates a provision of this article, any
order of the Board, or any term or condition under this article, the Village
may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in Cabell
County Circuit Court, seeking damages and costs associated with damage to or
increased operating costs of the Village, payment of any fines or penalties
that the Village may be assessed by any regulatory agency, and attorney fees
and court costs.
   (b)   Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. If a
person has violated, or continues to violate the provisions of this article,
the Village may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a preliminary or
permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create
further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation
of the violation, including a requirement for the person to conduct
environmental remediation. Any such person against whom such an injunction is
issued shall be responsible for paying all costs of the Village in obtaining
and enforcing such injunction, including the court costs and attorney’s fees.

   929.23  VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   (a)   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided in
this article, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of
the provisions of this article shall be considered a threat to the public
health, safety, welfare and the environment, may be declared and deemed a
nuisance, and may be summarily abated and/or restored by, or at the direction
of the Village, by its Mayor. The Village may initiate any civil actions in the
Circuit Court of Cabell County as necessary to abate, enjoin or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance, including a requirement for the person
to conduct environmental remediation.
   (b)   The cost of such abatement and/or restoration shall be the sole
responsibility of the owner of the property and the cost thereof shall be a
lien upon and against the property. Such lien shall continue in existence until
the same shall be paid.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.24 CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND PENALTIES IN MUNICIPAL COURT.
   In addition to, and not in lieu of, any administrative remedy or judical
enforcement provisions provided in this article, any person who intentionally
violates provisions of this article shall constitute a criminal misdemeanor,
and be subject to a criminal warrant or citation in municipal court as provided
by Article Six of the Charter in the Codified Ordinances of the Village, and
upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Every
day or portion thereof that a person fails or refuses to remedy a violation
shall be considered a separate offense.
(Ord. 2022-05. Passed 9-5-22.)
   929.25  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS AND SERVICES.
   The Board may immediately suspend a person’s discharge, after informal
notice to the person, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Board may also immediately suspend a person’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
sewer system, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
   Any person notified of an emergency suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a person’s failure
to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Board may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the system, its receiving stream,
or endangerment to any persons. The Board may allow the person to recommence
its discharge when the person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless a termination of service
proceedings are initiated against the person through a show cause hearing as
provided by Section
929.19.
   A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Board prior to the date of any show cause

SCHEDULE IV
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN CASE WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE
IS CONNECTED TO THE TOWN'S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
APPLICABILITY
Wherever the Village has discovered that a customer's roof drain, down spout,
storm sewer or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the Village's sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
Sanitary Board, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public
Service Commission, to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed
upon the customer calculated on the basis of the following formula:
S = A x R x .006233 x C
S -       the surcharge in dollars
A -       the area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet
R -      the measured monthly rainfall in inches
.006233 -    the conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousand gallons of water
C -      The Town's approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage
The Village shall not impose the surcharge unless, and until, the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt request, or by hand delivery,
that it has been established by smoke testing, due testing, or on-site
inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer's location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water
from the sanitary sewer system.
Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give ruse to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
SCHEDULE V
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLISED IN THE CASES OF USERS
PRODUCING UNUSUAL WASTE
The charge for the treatment of industrial waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi +BoBi + SoSi
Ci =    charge to unusual users per year
Vo =      average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in
dollars per gallon
Vi =    volume of wastewater from unusual users in gallons per year
Bo =    average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen Demand
(BOD) in dollars per pound
Bi =       weight of BOD from unusual users in pounds per year
So =    average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment) chargeable
to total solids in dollars per pound
Si =       weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the Village, should not be introduced into
the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results of this preliminary
study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service
and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out above.
Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit
of the Village records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the
above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be paid
by the unusual user. Based on these audited figures, additional billing
covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or
refund given by the Village, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then
be used for preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which
an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.
SCHEDULE VI
APPLICABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CORPORATE LIMITS
OF THE VILLAGE OF BARBOURSVILLE
Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Village waste treatment
system by certain industrial plant or plants cannot be accurately determined by
the use of the plant's water meter or meters, and the said plant cannot install
a flow meter to measure such waste, a special formula will be used whereby such
plant or plants will pay to the Village sewer charge calculated at fifty (50)
gallons of water per each employee at the plant each working day.

adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
   P.   Freeboard.
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes
of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for unknown factors
that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights of any given flood and

either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   JJ.   State Coordinating Office.
The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
   KK.   Stream.
As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse, whether natural or man-

which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its volume.
   LL.   Structure.      
A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   MM.   Substantial Damage.
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to it's before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial
damage also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a 10 year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See "Substantial
Improvement."
   NN.   Substantial Improvement.
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the Start of Construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
   OO.   Top of Bank.
The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a stream indicate
the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar with fluvial
geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional is not
employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
   PP.   Violation.
The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant with all the
requirements of this article. Any structure or other development lacking the
certifications, finished construction elevation certificate or other evidence
of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   3.3 Changes in Designation of Area.
   A.   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by Village of Barboursville where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
   B.   Village of Barboursville's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, Village of Barboursville shall notify the NFIP Administrator
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
   C.   Village of Barboursville may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   3.4 Boundary Disputes.
   Should a dispute concerning the location of proposed development relative to
a special flood hazard area arise, an initial determination shall be made by
the Floodplain Administrator and any party aggrieved by this decision may
appeal to Village of Barboursville. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
   3.5 Elevations Prevail.
   Elevation data certified by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or Registered
Professional Engineer shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   A.   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood damage
reduction requirements of this ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent grade
(LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable base
flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The applicant
shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to
have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the structure or
specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the applicant
will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or excavation and
information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be provided.
   B.   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the special
flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is below
either; 1. The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance study,
or 2. The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by Village of
Barboursville in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then
be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of
this article.
      (Ord. 2014-01. Passed 1-21-14.)
1709.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   4.1 Floodway.
   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within Village of
Barboursville during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant
engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   A.   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property due
to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      1.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      2.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      3.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      4.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of Village of
Barboursville, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent
land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area
as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of
the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   4.2 Floodway Fringe.
   Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/or use of land shall be
permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions
contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   4.3 AE without Floodway.
   Within any AE without Floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of
the floodway where determined.
   4.4 Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
   A.   Within any Approximated Floodplain
      1.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      2.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all proposed
development to determine; 1. The amount being invested and, 2. The specific
flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the
applicant to determine the elevation above which the development will be
reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are
required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer
who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      3.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   See appendix 4.4 for Sample "Approximated floodplain (Zone A) techniques"
   4.5 Alteration or relocation of a stream.
   A.   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within the
special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified
mail, to Village of Barboursville, The Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval.
   See appendix 4.5 for Sample "Stream Alteration process and contact sheet"
   B.   The developer shall also assure Village of Barboursville in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   C.   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or other
stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of certain
"best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
   D.   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream crossings
shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
ordinance.
   E.   The developer is required to provide Village of Barboursville a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in this article.
   F.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose. (Ord. 2014-01. Passed 1-21-14.)

will suffice.
   5.3 Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the freeboard height
required by this ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
   A.   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation:
      1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its relation
to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
      3.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure

sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
      5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements of
the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it is
highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
      6.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared by a
Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications. The
elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question, together
with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
      7.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant whenever
Village of Barboursville determines that the area below the first floor could
be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall state:
         (i)   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
         (ii)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the

signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in this article.
   B.   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on dry
flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above the
Base Flood Elevation.
      1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by a
Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
      3.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA, shall
be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the plans in
(1) above, stating that the finished structure, together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
         (i)    The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         (ii)   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
   C.   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only)
      1.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others
of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground, proposed
finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of proposed
flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the floodway
boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present on the
site.
      2.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
         (i)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest structural
element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all utilities are
located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         (ii)   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      3.    In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in this article.
   5.4 Site Plan Criteria.
   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
   A.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
   B.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
   C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
   D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which are
proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
      1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the data
contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
      2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required data
may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
      3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the approximated
floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map, development of
detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to
be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary area as
scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed
Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   5.5 - Restrictions to Subdivision of land in special flood hazard areas.
   Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots
that include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and
be served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 2014-01. Passed 1-21-14.)

requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   E.   Fill. Village of Barboursville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
      1.   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      2.   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      3.   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      4.   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section 4.1 of this article. All fill placed in the special flood hazard area
shall meet or exceed the following standards:
         a.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. Village of Barboursville may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by Village of Barboursville During permit review Village of
Barboursville shall consider the following issues that have the potential to
cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            i.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            ii.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            iii.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            iv.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            v.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         b.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         c.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         d.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         e.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         f.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         g.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         h.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            i.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            ii.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         i.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         j.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   F.   Placement of Structures and other development.
      1.   All structures and other development shall be constructed or placed
on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and
shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height
of floodwater.
         i.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         ii.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   G.   Anchoring
      1.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      2.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks located
at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   H.   Flood Protection Setback
      1.   Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the watercourse
channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the opposite bank or
50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top of the banks of
all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be maintained in
this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the watercourse and
conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be given to
planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance flood
protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      2.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   I.   Storage.
      1.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      2.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or readily
removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      3.    Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   J.   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      1.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      2.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      3.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      4.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   K.   Drainage
      1.    Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      2.    Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   L.    Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area. (Ord. 2014-01. Passed 1-21-14.)

   7.9 Certificate of Compliance.
   A.   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to permit
the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or partly
altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of compliance
has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the building or
land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying or using a
building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the violator to
the penalties described in Section 8.3.
   B.   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and approve a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the inspector is
in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by the Local

inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section 8.3.
   C.   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a permanent
utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section 8.3.
   D.   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local Administrator
upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of special flood
hazard.
   E.   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this article or local administrative procedures, and
any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing
certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a
condition of permit approval.
   7.10 Fees.   
   A.   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by Village of Barboursville.
   B.   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to Village of Barboursville based upon a set schedule approved by

as determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
   C.   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing Village
of Barboursville for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
   D.   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this article is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse Village of Barboursville for the
additional cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully
recover this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent
occurrence by the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve
any person from complying fully with the requirements of this article in the
execution of the work or from other penalties prescribed herein. (Ord. 2014-01.
Passed 1-21-14.)
1709.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   8.1 Appeals.

be heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be final in all cases.
          8.2 Appeal Review Criteria.
   A.   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative substantial
damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or the freeboard
requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals Board.
   B.   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article shall
adhere to the following criteria:
      1.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board upon
(i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure
to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
      2.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination that
it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered sufficient
justification to grant an appeal.
      3.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      4.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a Village of Barboursville official that (i) the issuance of a
decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such
construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in paragraph (4) of this section; and
      5.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency

shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall expeditiously prosecute
all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to Village of
Barboursville of not less than fifty dollars or more than five hundred dollars
plus cost of prosecution. In default of such payment such person shall be
imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10 days. Each day during which any
violation of this ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense. In
addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved
including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The
imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-compliance with,
this ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance with the
ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to
correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time.
Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in
non-compliance with this ordinance may be declared by the Commission of Village

      (3)   The Land Owner/Developer shall control waste such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste at the construction site,
      (4)   The Land Owner/Developer shall demonstrate that the registration
under the WV /NPDES construction storm water general permit has been obtained
for those sites one acre and greater.
         A.   Provided the Department has approved the Land Owner/Developer as
a Qualifying Local Program, WV/NPDES construction stormwater permit will be
issued by the Village of Barboursville and not by the Department.
      (5)   The Land Owner/Developer shall incorporate the consideration of
potential water quality impacts and review of individual pre-construction site
plans to ensure consistency with local and State sediment and erosion control
requirements.
      (6)   The Land Owner/Developer shall recognize that the Village of
Barboursville inspectors have the authority for site inspections and
enforcement of control measures including steps to identify priority sites for
inspection and enforcement based on the nature of the construction activity,
topography, and the characteristics of soils and receiving water quality.
   (c)   The Land Owner/Developer shall manage the impact of stormwater on
receiving waters and the program shall include site and neighborhood design
elements implemented in tandem with watershed protection elements.
      (1)   The Land Owner/Developer shall keep and manage onsite the first 1
inch of rainfall from an average 24-hour storm preceded by 48 hours of no
measurable precipitation or that provide equal benefits for quality water.
      (2)   The first 1" of rainfall must be 100% managed with no discharge to
surface waters except when the Land Owner/Developer allows an alternative
approach as described below:
         A.   Stonnwater is treated before release to surface waters via
extended or engineered infiltration. Extended filtration practices that are
designed to capture and manage up to one inch of rainfall may discharge through
an underdrain system.
         B.   The VOB may develop and implement a program to collect payment in
lieu of on-site retention, provided in-lieu funds are used for stormwater
projects only.
         C.   The VOB may develop and implement an off-site mitigation program.
         D.   The Land Owner/Developer may propose and obtains approval of an
alternative method of managing the first 1" of rainfall. The method must be
equally protective of water quality as the methods spelled out in the permit.
      (3)   Run-off volume reduction can be achieved by:
      A.   Canopy interception,
         B.   Soil amendments,
         C.   Evaporation,
         D.   Evapotranspiration,
         E.   Rainfall harvesting such as rain tanks and cisterns,   
         F.   Grass channels and swales,
         G.   Reforestation,
         H.   Green roofs,
         I.   Rooftop disconnections, such as gutter drains,
         J.   Permeable pavers/pavement,
         K.   Porous concrete,
         L.   Engineered infiltration including extended infiltration via
bioretention cells with eventual release,
         M.   Release to groundwater may require an Underground Injection
Control Permit and Land Owner/Developer are required to list projects using
this practice in the annual report, or
         N.   Any combination of these methods.
      (4)   In instances where alternatives to complete on-site retention of
the first inch of rainfall are allowed, technical justification as to the
infeasibility of on-site retention is required, must be documented and approved
by WVDEP.
   (d)   The program shall require all new and redevelopment projects to
control stormwater discharge rates, volumes, velocities, durations and
temperatures.
   (e)   When considered at the watershed scale, certain types of development
can either reduce existing impervious surfaces, or at least create less
“accessory” impervious surfaces.
      (1)   Incentive standards may be applied to these types of projects.
      (2)   A reduction of 0.2 inches from the one inch runoff reduction
standard may be applied to any of the following types of development:
         A.   Redevelopment,
         B.   Brownfield redevelopment
         C.   High density (> 7 units per acre)
         D.   Vertical Density, (Floor to Area Ratio (FAR) of 2 or> 18 units
per acre)
         E.   Mixed use and Transit Oriented Development (within 1 mile of
transit)
      (3)   Reductions are additive up to a maximum reduction of .75 inches for
a project that meets four or more criteria.
      (4)   The Land Owner/Developer may choose to be more restrictive and
allow a reduction of less than 0.75 inches if they choose.
      (5)   In no case will the reduction be greater than 0.75 inches.
   (f)   Existing Land Owner/Developers shall continue to implement, assess,
and enforce site and neighborhood design elements in accordance with the
approved SWMP schedule.
   (g)   The Land Owner/Developer shall designate projects with reasonable
potential for pollutant loadings as Hot Spots. Water quality treatment
practices will be provided prior to infiltration or discharge and will be
designed for the specific pollutant and source, for example only, petroleum
hydrocarbons at a vehicle fueling island.
      (1)   A project that is a potential hot spot with reasonable potential
for pollutant loading(s) that cannot implement adequate preventive or water
quality treatment measures to ensure compliance with groundwater and/or surface
water quality standards, must properly convey stormwater to a NPDES- permitted
wastewater treatment facility or via a licensed waste hauler to a permitted
treatment and disposal facility.
      (2)   A project that discharges or proposes to discharge to any surface
water or ground water that is used as a source of drinking water must comply
with all applicable requirements relating to source water protection.
   (h)   For projects that cannot meet 100% of the runoff reduction requirement
on site, the Land Owner/Developer may allow an alternative approach for off-
site mitigation, payment in lieu, or for another approved method of capturing
or treating the subject first 1" stormwater.
      (1)   Prior to allowing an alternative, the Land Owner/Developer must
develop, implement, assess, and enforce criteria that can be consistently
applied.
      (2)   The Land Owner/Developer's SWMP must be modified and approved by
the Director and the governing body to allow for approval of alternative
approaches.
      (3)   The Land Owner/Developer must develop and apply criteria for
determining the circumstances under which these alternatives will be approved.
      (4)   A determination to allow an alternative to on-site stormwater
retention and treatment may be based on the difficulty or cost of implementing
measures. For example only:

West Virginia registered professional engineer by the method approved by the
Planning Commission or Planning Officer, and a copy of the design computations
shall be submitted along with plans; and
   (g)    Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across
or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred (600)
feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are
exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that
point and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
      (Ord. 2005-10. Passed 1-3-06.)
1915.02 NATURE OF STORM WATER FACILITIES.
    (a)    Location. The Applicant may be required by the Planning Commission
or Planning Officer to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface
water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of the construction
of an Adults Only Establishment. Such drainage facilities shall be located in
the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the construction
standards and specifications. Junction boxes and/or drop inlets may be
required, if warranted.
   (b)    Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers. Where a public storm sewer is
accessible, the Applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no
outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provisions shall be made for
the disposal of storm waters, subject to the specifications of the Planning
Commission or Planning Officer. Where a future connection to a public storm
sewer is probable, because such a system is currently in the planning stages,
the Applicant shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a
public utility system at the time the site plan receives final approval.
Provisions for such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the
performance bond required for the site plan.
   (c)    Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other drainage
facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff
from its entire upstream drainage area. The Applicant shall employ a registered
professional engineer to determine the necessary size of the facility, based on
the provisions of the construction standards and specifications assuming
conditions of maximum potential watershed development.
   (d)    Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The Applicant's engineer shall
also study the effects the site plan may have on existing downstream drainage
facilities outside the area of the site plan. County drainage studies together
with such other appropriate studies shall serve as a guide to needed
improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the site plan may overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Planning Commission or Planning Officer may withhold issuance of
Permit or Certificate of Compliance, or revoke said issuance if applicable,
until provisions are made for the improvement of said potential condition in
such a manner as the Planning Commission or Planning Officer shall determine.
No site plan shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an
adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   (e)    Areas of Poor Drainage. Whenever a site plan is submitted for an area
which is subject to flooding, the Planning Commission or Planning Officer may
approve the site plan provided that the Applicant fills the affected area of
said site plan to an elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and
lots above the FEMA one hundred (100) year base flood elevation or known
flooding elevations. The site plan shall provide for an overflow zone along the
bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width which shall be sufficient in
times of high water to contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed
in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or placed therein. The
boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the Planning
Commission or Planning Officer. Development of areas of extremely poor drainage
shall be discouraged. The Applicant's engineer shall design the site plan so
that drainage from underdeveloped lots shall not be directed onto developed
lots.
   (f)    Floodplain Areas. The applicant shall comply with all requirements of
the Floodplain Management Program Ordinance of the County/Village of
Barboursville.
   (g)    Wetlands. Developments which have a negative impact on wetlands shall
be discouraged. The existence of wetlands shall be determined by the
appropriate federal, state or local agency.
(Ord. 2005-10. Passed 1-3-06.)
1915.03 DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
    (a)    General Requirements. Where a site plan is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right- of-way confirming substantially to the lines
of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width
reserved for discharge of the base flood.
   (b)    Drainage Easements. Where topography or other conditions are such as
to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-
way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for
such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road
lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on
the site plan. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities. A ten (10) foot drainage easement
for lot drainage shall be required on lot lines (five (5) feet on each side)
when not being used as part of the drainage plan improvements.
      (1)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the Premises, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the site-plan.
       (2)    The Applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Planning Commission or Planning Officer, which
shall be at a minimum the distance from the top of the slope of the stream bank
to the center of the channel.
      (3)    Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the average density nor for computing the area requirement of any
lot.
         (Ord. 2005-10. Passed 1-3-06.)
1915.04 CERTIFICATION.
   The Applicant's engineer shall inspect the Premises after the provisions of
this Article have been fulfilled and, upon a demonstration of compliance
herewith, issue a letter to the Planning Officer certifying compliance with
this Article.
