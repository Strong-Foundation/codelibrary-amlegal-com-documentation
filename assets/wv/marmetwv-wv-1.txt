EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

law shall not be revived without express words for that purpose.
(WVaC 2-2-9)
   (b)   The repeal of a law, or its expiration by virtue of any provision
contained therein, shall not affect any offense committed, or penalty or

only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform as far as practicable to the
laws in force at the time such proceedings take place, unless otherwise
specially provided; and that if any penalty or punishment be mitigated by the
new law, such new law may, with the consent of the part affected thereby, be
applied to any judgment pronounced after it has taken effect.
(WVaC 2-2-8)
   (c)   The repeal by any provision of the Codified Ordinances of an ordinance

   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified
Ordinances, such reference shall extend to and include any amendment of or
supplement to the section or group of sections so referred to or any section or
sections hereafter enacted in lieu thereof; and unless otherwise provided,
whenever a reference to a section or group of sections is made in any amendment
or supplement to any section of the Codified Ordinances hereafter enacted, such
reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended.

or an inclusive group of sections, such reference shall be construed to mean a
violation of any provision of the section or sections included in such
reference.

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

121.20 VACANCIES IN APPOINTED POSITIONS.
   (a)   Statement of Policy and Findings.
      (1)   Council recognizes the importance of providing the highest level of
services to our residents within our budgeted means. Council also recognizes
that when vacancies occur in budgeted positions it is of the utmost importance
to not only fill those positions in a fair and equitable manner with the most
qualified candidates but also to fill those positions in as expeditious a
manner as possible so that no essential services are interrupted or lessened.
      (2)   Council also recognizes that, according to §8-5-11 of the West
Virginia Code, the power to determine how vacancies are filled is vested
exclusively with this Council. To this end Council enacts this section to
establish procedures for the filling of vacancies, not previously addressed in
these ordinances.
   (b)   Notice of Vacancy. Once a vacancy is created in any appointed position
of the City of Marmet, Council shall be notified immediately by either the
Mayor or the Department or Division head. It is preferred that this Notice be
made in writing to the City Clerk and said Notice identify the reason for the
vacancy and the amount of salary budgeted for the position. If a vacancy occurs
and Council is not notified in this manner it may still commence the process
for filling said vacancy.
   (c)   Vacancy Declared. Once an employee has separated from employment with
the Town of Marmet, it is within the Council’s purview to declare the vacancy.
If Council determines that fiscal prudence dictates that the position not be
filled immediately then it may delay filling the position, choose not to fill
the position or remove the position from the budget, in its sole discretion. If
Council determines that the vacancy will be filled within a reasonable time
frame it may authorize the search for qualified candidates. Council may utilize
any mode of applicant pool creation it deems advisable. This may include any of
the following methods:
      (1)   A review of applications currently of file;
      (2)   Advertisement of the position in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Marmet area inviting interested applicants to apply;
      (3)   Advertisement in a trade magazine or journal inviting interested
applicants to apply;
      (4)   Advertisement of the position on a relevant on-line job placement
site inviting interested applicants to apply;
      (5)   Posting the position on a local job board inviting interested
applicants to apply, or,
      (6)   Any other method that the Council deems reasonable depending on
existing exigencies.
   (d)   Review of Applications. Upon receipt of applications, Council may meet
as a body and determine the best and most qualified applicant/applicants from
the applicant pool. Council may elect to offer the position to the most
qualified candidate based on review of the applications only or, Council may
choose to interview one or more qualified candidates in order to ascertain the
most qualified.
   (e)   Background Checks/Reference Checks. Council may, if it deems
advisable, conduct background and/or reference checks to insure that an
applicant meets the requirements of the position. Council may reject any
candidate who fails to meet the requirements of a background check.
   (f)   Council to Determine Fitness and Qualifications of Candidates. Council
shall be the sole judge of the fitness and qualifications of any candidate. In
exercising this judgment Council may enlist the assistance of department heads
in order to develop an understanding of the qualifications and skills needed to
perform the duties of the vacant position. Council may also determine what
skills, education, training and experience are necessary to fulfill the
requirements of the vacant position.
   (g)   Appointments to be Made by Resolution. Once a prospective employee
accepts an offer of employment with the Town of Marmet, Council shall pass a
resolution confirming that appointment. This provision shall not apply to
temporary appointments not exceeding six (6) months.
   (h)   Equal Opportunity Employer. The Town of Marmet is an Equal Opportunity
Employer and shall not discriminate against anyone on the basis of age, sex,
race, creed, national origin, color, disability or any other impermissible
category.
   (i)   No Enforceable Rights. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
giving any prospective employee of the Town of Marmet any contractual rights of
employment. Further, all employees of the Town of Marmet are at-will employees
and may be terminated for any reason that is not discriminatory under
applicable local, state and federal law.

161.01 ALCOHOL, DRUG AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY.
   (a)   Pre-Employment Testing:
      (1)   Once an applicant has been approved for employment, the department
head or participating elected official will contact the potential employee
providing details of the drug testing procedure. A conditional offer of
employment will be made to the applicant. The applicant must provide a negative
drug test result before reporting to work. The potential employee will need to
report to the facility selected by the Town of Marmet for testing no more than
five (5) days prior to the first date of actual employment.
      (2)   The applicant will be asked to sign a consent form prior to the
testing procedure. If the applicant refuses to sign the consent form, said
action will automatically disqualify the applicant for employment with the
Town. The applicant will be given a copy of the procedures and guidelines the
testing facility follows with regard to testing.
      (3)   The applicant will be given the opportunity to list any medications
(prescription or non-prescription) currently being used or taken within the
past forty-eight (48) hours prior to any testing procedures. In addition, the
applicant may list any foods that may arguably alter such testing results. A
portion of the samples collected will be set aside so that in the event of a
positive test result, a second test might be performed.
      (4)   Test results will be provided by the testing facility to the Town
of Marmet or the appropriate participating elected official or their designee.
A positive drug test will disqualify the applicant for employment.
   (b)   Reasonable Suspicion Testing.
      (1)   Once it has been determined that an employee needs to be tested due
to Reasonable Suspicion using the proper protocol as outlined in the Policy,
the employee is to be immediately removed from duty by the appropriate
participating elected official or department head until drug testing is
completed and the results certified. The Town of Marmet or the appropriate
participating elected official will notify the employee that testing is
required and make arrangements to have the employee immediately escorted by a
designated person to the facility selected by the Town for testing. In the
event that medical attention is necessary, testing may be delayed for the time
required for medical attention, however, testing may not be delayed for more
than twenty-four (24) hours from the time the employee was informed that
testing is required.
      (2)   The employee will be asked to sign a consent form prior to the
testing procedure. If the employee refuses to sign the consent form, said
employee will automatically be suspended without pay and may be subject to
termination. The employee will be given a copy of the procedures and guidelines
the testing facility follows with regard to testing.
      (3)   The employee will be given the opportunity to list any medications
(prescription or non-prescription) currently being used or taken within the
past forty-eight (48) hours prior to any testing procedures. In addition, the
employee may list any foods that may arguably alter such testing results.
      (4)   A portion of the samples collected will be set aside so that in the
event of a positive test result, a second test might be performed. The Town of
Marmet or the appropriate participating elected official reserves the right to
place any person undergoing testing on suspension with pay pending the return
of such results.
      (5)   Test results will be provided by the testing facility to the City
or the appropriate participating elected official or their designee. A positive
drug test will be handled by the City or the appropriate participating elected
official as outlined in the Policy.
   (c)   Random Testing.
      (1)   Federal DOT guidelines provide that twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Safety-Sensitive pool be tested annually. Monthly random testing is
recommended using the formula of dividing the annual total to be tested by
twelve (12) to determine the number to be tested monthly. The Town of Marmet
will adopt the Federal DOT guidelines. At date of implementation this would
equate to three (3) to four (4) employees from the random Safety-Sensitive pool
to be tested monthly.
      (2)   The testing facility selected by the Town will provide to the Town
on a random monthly basis the list of employees randomly selected from the
Safety-Sensitive pool to be tested. The appropriate participating elected
official will notify the randomly selected employee and make arrangements to
have the randomly selected employee escorted by a designated person to the on-
premises testing site.
      (3)   The employee will be asked to sign a consent form prior to the
testing procedure. If the employee refuses to sign the consent form, said
employee will automatically be suspended without pay and may be subject to
termination. The employee will be given a copy of the procedures and guidelines
the testing facility follows with regard to testing.
      (4)   The employee will be given the opportunity to list any medications
(prescription or non-prescription) currently being used or taken within the
past forty-eight (48) hours prior to any testing procedures. In addition, the
employee may list any foods that may arguably alter such testing results.
      (5)   A portion of the samples collected will be set aside so that in the
event of a positive test result, a second test might be performed. The Town of
Marmet or the appropriate participating elected official reserves the right to
place any person undergoing testing on suspension with pay pending the return
of such results.
      (6)   Test results will be provided by the testing facility to the Town
of Marmet or the appropriate participating elected official or their designee.
A positive drug test will be handled by the Town of Marmet or the appropriate
participating elected official as outlined in the Policy.
   (d)   Return to Duty Testing.
      (1)   Before an employee returns to work after engaging in conduct that
is prohibited under this Policy, the employee will undergo a return to duty
test. The employee will need to report to the facility selected by the Town for
testing no more than five (5) days before the actual return to work date.
      (2)   Any employee who has been off from work for thirty (30) days or
more will be required to undergo a return to duty test. The employee will need
to report to the facility selected by the Town for testing no more than five
(5) days before the actual return to work date.
      (3)   The returning employee will be asked to sign a consent form prior
to the testing procedure. If the returning employee refuses to sign the consent
form, said returning employee will automatically be disqualified from returning
for employment. The returning employee will be given a copy of the procedures
and guidelines the testing facility follows with regard to testing. (11-9-09.)

week, at such reasonable hours as shall be specified by the Municipal Judge, in
a suitable court room in the City; and all sessions shall be open to the

to do and is consistent with law.
   (b)   The Chief of Police shall designate a police officer to attend each
session of the Municipal Court to serve as bailiff of the court, to preserve

willfully refuse to attend as required by such summons shall be punished as
provided in Section
101.99.
181.08 BAIL BONDS.
   (a)   Except as may be provided otherwise in any case by the provisions of
Article 1C, Chapter 62 of the Code of West Virginia, as amended, whenever any
person is arrested for any violation of an ordinance of the City or for any
offense of which the Municipal Judge has jurisdiction, it shall be lawful for
the Municipal Judge, City Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk, Mayor, Chief of
Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police headquarters to
admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the City in such an
amount as in the discretion of the officer will secure the prisoner's presence,
conditioned that the accused will appear upon a day named, before the Municipal
Judge, to await trial; and every such bond taken shall be filed as soon as
practicable with the Municipal Court Clerk by the officer approving and taking
such bond; and the Municipal Judge, City Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk,
Mayor, Chief of Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police
headquarters shall each have the power to approve any bond taken under the
provisions of this section, precedence being given to the ranking officer
present at police headquarters when such bond is presented. No person shall be
accepted as surety upon any penal bond unless he shall acknowledge the bond
before some official duly authorized by this Code or by State law to administer
an oath, and shall make oath that he is the owner in fee of real estate situate
in Kanawha County and worth the amount of the bond over and above his debts and
liabilities; but the officers hereinbefore named in this section are hereby
authorized and empowered to accept a deposit in cash of an amount which, in the
judgment of the officer accepting the deposit, will be sufficient to cause the
prisoner's appearance upon the day required to him before the Municipal Judge
to await trail upon the charge against him. The amount of such deposit shall
not be less than a sum sufficient in the judgment of the officer accepting the
same to satisfy any reasonable fine and costs which may be imposed by the
Municipal Judge. In the event any person so released upon bond or such deposit
shall fail to appear before the Municipal Judge for trials at the appointed
time, or, having appeared, shall leave the court without waiting trials, his
bond shall be forfeited thereby to the City, and if a cash deposit has been
made to secure his release, the sum so deposited shall be delivered to the
Municipal Judge as soon as may be practicable, no later than the following
morning, and by him promptly turned into the City Treasury to the credit of the
general fund and accounted for by him in the same manner that fines collected
by him are accounted for; and in the event of the forfeiture of a penal bond,
the City Treasurer shall forthwith take the steps necessary at law for the
collection thereof.
   (b)   Bail bond cards issued by automobile associations to their members
shall be accepted for traffic violations in accord with the terms of such
cards.
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the admission
of a person to bail upon his own recognizance when such is authorized by law
and when the officer, in the exercise of sound discretion, considers it proper
to do so.
181.09 CONTEMPT.
   (a)   When Punishment Authorized.  The Municipal Judge may issue attachments
for contempt, and punish summarily, only in the following cases:
      (1)   Misbehavior in the presence of his court, or so near thereto as to

officer, witness or party going thereto, attending or returning from court, for
or in respect of any act or proceeding had or to be had in such court.

warning light visible from in front of the vehicle.

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

street or highway construction maintenance work, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.
(WVaC 17C-3-9)
313.08 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES.

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C- 5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense

impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating

other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time

afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the

appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01  or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,

he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his
or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in
response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any
inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01 .
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

registration plate or removable windshield placard may park the vehicle for
unlimited periods of time in parking zones unrestricted as to length of parking
time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or

a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be fined two
hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred
dollars ($300.00); and upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in
addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined
five hundred dollars ($500.00).

the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.

plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be fined two
hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred
dollars ($300.00); and upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in
addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined
five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (j)   Parking enforcement personnel who otherwise enforce parking violations
may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (k)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   The Municipality in enforcing this section shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions

authority, or governing body of a state agency that has jurisdiction over the
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail expressly permits that
operation.

373.09(b), the court may waive the fine upon receipt of satisfactory proof that
the person has a helmet or within a reasonable time from the date of the
violation, purchased or otherwise obtained, a protective bicycle helmet.
   (c)   It is an absolute defense to a charge for a violation of Section

bicycle helmet. Inability to pay may be demonstrated by the filing of a
financial affidavit in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 59-

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

725.01 TITLE; FINDINGS.
   (a)   Title. The Ordinance shall be known as the Adults Only Establishment
Location Ordinance of 2003.
   (b)   Findings. The Town of Marmet finds:
      (1)   That it has a substantial government interest in protecting the
public health, safety and welfare of its citizens; and
      (2)   That Adults Only Establishments require special supervision from
public safety agencies to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare
of the employees, patrons and neighbors of Adults Only Establishments and the
citizens of the County; and
      (3)   That there is convincing documented evidence that Adults Only
Establishments, because of their very nature, have deleterious effects on
existing and future business establishments and residential areas, causing
increased crime and the deterioration of property values; and
      (4)   That Adults Only Establishments, because of their very nature, have
serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are
located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to blight and
downgrading the quality of life in adjacent areas; and
      (5)   That the regulation of the location of Adults Only Establishments
is necessary to prevent undesirable secondary effects on surrounding areas,
including, without limitation, a tendency to attract an undesirable quantity of
transients; to adversely affect real property values; to cause an increase in
crime; to contribute to the blighting of residential and commercial areas; and
to impede the development of businesses and residences; and
      (6)   Through enactment of a land use ordinance the Town desires to
minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the
health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of adjacent areas; and deter the spread of blight; and
      (7)   Although concerned about these adverse effects, the Town upholds
constitutionally protected speech and expression and does not desire to
infringe on constitutionally protected speech and expression; and
   The Town wishes to enact a content neutral ordinance that addresses only the
secondary effects of Adults Only Establishments within the Town Limits.

sale thereof for money; every closed transaction constituting a sale.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" means any person liable for any tax hereunder.
   (d)   "Gross income" means the gross receipts of the taxpayer: received as
compensation for personal services and the gross receipts of the taxpayer

accruing from the sale of tangible property (real or personal) or service, or
both, and all receipts by reason of the investment of the capital of the
business engaged in, including interest, discount, rentals, royalties, fees or
other emoluments however designated and without any deductions on account of
the cost of property sold, the cost of materials used, labor costs, taxes,
royalties, interest or discount paid or any other expense whatsoever.
   (e)   "Business" as used in this article, shall include all activities
engaged in or caused to be engaged in with the object of gain or economic
benefit, either direct or indirect. The production of raw materials or
manufactured products, which are used or consumed in the main business, shall
be deemed business engaged in, taxable in the class in which it falls.
   (f)   "Gross proceeds of sales" means the value actually proceeding from the
sale of tangible property without any deduction on account of the cost of
property sold or expenses of any kind. The words "Gross Income" and "Gross

taken on sales; the proceeds of sales of goods, wares or merchandise returned
by customers when the sale price is refunded in cash or by credit; or the sale
price of any article accepted as part payment on any new article sold, if the
full price of the new article is included in the gross income of gross proceeds
of said sale.
   (g)   "Service-business or calling" shall include activities engaged in for
other persons for a consideration, which involves the rendering of a service as

quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.

of the operation of the business by the former owner.

assessment of taxes under this article, for recordation, which shall thereafter
constitute binding notice of the lien created by this article upon all lands of

any case; and other parties in interest may also appear and be heard under
oath.
   (b)   After hearing all the facts in the case, if in the opinion of the
Mayor, no good and sufficient cause be shown why such nuisance should not be
abated, discontinued, or removed within the time allotted, which shall be
within the discretion of the Mayor, but shall in no case be less than ten (10)
days from the date of service of the initial order directing the nuisance be
abated, discontinued or removed, provided however, that if the initial order

permits for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (40)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-
related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event
equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (41)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the Start of Construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (42)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (43)   Violation.  The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all the requirements of this Ordinance. Any structure or
other development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
1717.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the Town of
Marmet which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) prepared for the Town of Marmet by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) dated February 6, 2008, or the most recent revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the
Town of Marmet which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the Town of
Marmet by use of historic or other technical data and shown on the Town of
Marmet Local Flood Hazards Map. These areas shall be designated as appropriate
with the level of technical data described below and shall be managed
accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas.  The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include floodway areas
identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed in subsection
(b)(4) below.
In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated, the
regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating
significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the community, be
considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from the top of
the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100 year floodplain
boundary.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the Town of Marmet where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more
detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a
River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual document the
necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the community shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The Town of Marmet may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived technical
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1717.06 . Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to
apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood
Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to Council. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
1717.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood
Elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) any development and/or use of land
shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related
provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)   AE Area Without Floodway (F3).
      (1)   Within any AE area without floodway, no new construction or
development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood
more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by
utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the Town of Marmet Floodplain Administrator, The State Coordinating Office, any
adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
Contact information for State and Federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate County, State & Federal
government agencies are contained in the Town of Marmet Stream Alteration
administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the Town of Marmet in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1717.08 (c).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
   (e)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone “A”).
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain area:
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine:
            1.   The amount being invested and
            2.   The specific flood risk at the site.
The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to determine the
elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe from flooding
using the techniques set forth in the Town of Marmet Approximate A zone
administrative procedures. When hydrologic and hydraulic analysis are required,
they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   C.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all
such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources
Conservation Service or State and local water resource department.
         B.   If the technical data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
1717.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain

of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications. The
elevation certificate must confirm that the structure in question, together
with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.

Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.      
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. hereof, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials - used
solely for parking of vehicles, or storage, (Appurtenant Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion Agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion Agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1717.08 (c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including Subdivisions Commercial development and Manufactured
Home Parks, shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain
Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fills. In
addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other proposed new
developments which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within
the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or
two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data
and shall delineate a floodway. If FEMA has completed a Flood Insurance Study
(FIS), that data must be used to substantiate the base
flood. Otherwise, the developer may submit data provided by an authoritative
source, such as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, state and local water resource departments, or
technical data developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those
contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lie partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the floodplain area and all proposed development including fill will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the floodplain boundary
depicted on the map, development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not
be necessary. In these cases the site plan for the proposed development must
show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate
the area to be developed and the location of the floodplain areas as depicted
on the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Floodplain Areas. Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than 1 foot below the
elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. All new structures must
be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of the
identified flood hazard area.

stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a
copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1717.08 (c).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.
         Recreational vehicles to be placed within any floodplain area shall
either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   Fill.  The Town of Marmet officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized.
In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1717.04 (a).
All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the following
standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The Town of Marmet may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Town
of Marmet. During permit review the community shall consider the following
issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted, no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use. Particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area must
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.
         A.   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
         B.   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Backflow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.
1717.07 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of Floodplain Administrator. The Mayor is hereby appointed
as Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement this local law by
granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
   (b)   Duties and Responsibilities of Floodplain Administrator.

the signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a decision to
allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in

violation of, or non-compliance with, this ordinance shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and

Ordinance which shall remain in full force and effect and for this purpose the
provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)   Liability. The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or

representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the Town of Marmet, or by
any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
