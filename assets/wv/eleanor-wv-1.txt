EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification.  Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number.  For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06.  The code and article numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the article number being all digits left of the decimal.  The
section number appears right of the decimal.  As another example, 113.10
indicates the code number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article
within code 1), and the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections.  For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinances, such reference shall extend to and include any amendment of or
supplement to the section or group of sections so referred to or any section or
sections hereafter enacted in lieu thereof; and unless otherwise provided,
whenever a reference to a section or group sections is made in any amendment or
supplement to any section of the Codified Ordinances hereafter enacted, such
reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended.
   Whenever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a section
or an inclusive group of sections, such reference shall be construed to mean a
violation of any provision of the section or sections included in such
reference.
References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
 
101.08  SEPARABILITY.
   Each section of the Codified Ordinances and every part of each section is an
independent section and part of a section, and the holding of any section or a
part thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause does not
affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.
 
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any

provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be fined not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.

105.01  THE GOVERNING BODY.
    State law sets up the basic form of the municipal governing body. It
consists of a mayor, recorder and council members, with each of the officers
having a vote. When the municipality has not been divided into wards or
election districts, there must be at least five council members. The Town of
Eleanor is authorized to establish additional elective offices by ordinance,
and may determine the offices or positions which are to be filled by
appointment or employment.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.02  TERMS OF OFFICE.
   All officers serve two-year terms in the Town of Eleanor if holding biennial
elections, and four-year terms in the Town of Eleanor if holding quadrennial
elections. Terms may be increased from two to four years by approval by a
majority of votes cast in a regularly scheduled election of the Town of
Eleanor. The officers may be elected to the longer terms at the same election
in which the amendment or proposition for four years terms is passed, providing
the ballot labels for the officers so indicate. 
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.03  VACANCIES OF OFFICES.
   When a vacancy occurs in the Town of Eleanor elective office, the governing
body fills the vacancy by appointment until the next election. A vacancy occurs
when a resignation is accepted by the governing body, except that a member's
resignation will not be effective if it deprives the governing body of a
quorum. After a resignation is accepted, the governing body should give notice
of its intention to fill the vacancy by appointment at a regular or special
meeting. When a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor, or the mayor is unable
to perform the duties due to absence or illness, the recorder performs the
duties of mayor until the mayor can resume the duties or a new mayor is
appointed and qualified.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.04  GENERAL ELECTION.
   Every municipal general election which is not set by charter provision must
be held on the second Tuesday in June. The West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals has held that a general election held on any date other than the date
authorized could be ruled invalid.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.05  CANDIDATES ELIGIBILITY.
   The West Virginia State Supreme Court of Appeals has ruled that municipal
elective officers are subject only to the eligibility requirements of a voter.
Therefore, officers must be a minimum of 18 years of age, be a resident of the
municipality, and not be under conviction of a felony or other
disqualification. The eligibility requirements are generally applied as of the
election day. 
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.06  PROHIBITIONS AGAINST CANDIDACY/CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (a)   Municipal Employees. Except for prohibitions against candidacy
established by ordinance, and those for municipal police and fire department
employees under civil service plans, there is no state prohibition against
municipal employees becoming candidates or holding office.
   (b)   State and County Classified Employees.    Persons employed in
"classified" positions (formerly called "civil service") with the state or
county, including all employees of the Department of Highways, correctional
officers, deputy sheriffs in covered counties, and other covered employees are
prohibited from becoming a candidate for any office, whether partisan or non-
partisan.
   (c)   Federal Hatch Act Employees.  Covered federal employees and certain
covered state and local employees in programs funded by the federal governments
are generally prohibited from seeking partisan political office, but may seek
non-partisan office.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.07  CHALLENGING A CANDIDATE’S ELIGIBILITY.
   Neither the Town of Eleanor's recorder nor the governing body have the
authority to make judgments about whether a candidate meets the eligibility
requirements. Eligibility can be challenged in two ways, either by a court
proceeding seeking to have the candidate's name removed from the ballot before
the election, or afterwards by an election contest if the candidate in question
wins.  (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.08  NOMINATION OF CANDIDATES.
   The Town of Eleanor shall hold non-partisan elections, and shall dispense
with a separate nominating process. Candidates simply file a certificate of
announcement for an office, and the persons receiving a plurality of votes for
mayor and recorder in a single general election are the winners. The candidates
for Council receiving the highest votes fill the available seats.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.09  CANDIDATE FILING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Certificate of Announcement; Filing Period.  The Town of Eleanor shall
require a candidate file a certificate of announcement between the second
Monday of January and the last Saturday of January before the election. The
filing is made with the municipal recorder, and may be made by mail, but must
be postmarked by the U. S. Postal Service no later than midnight of the last
day of filing. The form of the certificate is set out by law, and must be
notarized. An incomplete certificate of announcement which lacks essential
information may be rejected. Public notice of the candidate filing times and
requirements should be made at least two weeks before the filing period. Forms
and written information about candidate filing should also be available by that
time. Before distributing these forms, the recorder should enter the date of
drawing for ballot position on reverse side of the certificate of announcement,
in order to meet the requirement that candidates be given notice of the drawing
at the time of filing.
   (b)   Filing Fees.  Candidate must pay a filing fee of five dollars ($5.00).
The fee must be paid within the filing period. An alternative to the filing fee
must be provided.  Under state law, the candidate may have the filing fee
waived by filing an oath that he/she is unable to pay the filing fee and a
petition containing signatures of four registered voters of the municipality
for each $1 of the filing fee. The completed petition must be filed no later
than the close of candidate filing.
   (c)   Prohibition Against Running for Two Offices.  The law prevents a
candidate's name from appearing on the ballot for any office if that candidate
files a certificate of announcement for more than one office and does not
formally withdraw from all but one office before the close of the filing
period.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.10  WITHDRAWAL OF CANDIDATES.
   A candidate who files a written statement of withdrawal received by the
recorder by the third Tuesday following the close of filing is to be removed
from the ballot.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.11  FILLING BALLOT VACANCIES.
   The Town of Eleanor, having non-partisan elections and having no established
executive committees, vacancies on the ballot can be filled by the Governing
Body.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.12  WRITE-IN CANDIDATES.
   Write-in candidates are required to file a certificate of announcement at
least 20 days before the general election in order to have their votes counted.
Once they announce the intention to run a write-in campaign, they are required
to file campaign financial statements, just as other candidates are. No filing
fee is required for official write-in candidates. Only votes for certified
write-in candidates are to be counted.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
   105.13  RECORDER AND BOARD OF BALLOT COMMISSIONERS.
   The recorder assumes the responsibilities for ballots which are assigned to
the circuit clerk in state law. When the law refers to the board of ballot
commissioners, the duties are to be performed by the municipal board of ballot
commissioners, consisting of the recorder and two appointed members, one of
each party. The recorder appoints the two other ballot commissioners between
January 15 and January 30 of the election year. The ballot commissioners should
represent the Democratic and Republican parties, and the recorder should work
with the municipal council to identify those persons to appoint. The primary
factor in the selection of ballot commissioners is their availability to serve
at the time of ballot certification. The duties of the board of ballot
commissioners include certification and ordering of the ballots.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.14  DRAWING FOR BALLOT POSITIONS.
   Ballot positions are determined by a required drawing for ballot position
for an office whenever more than one candidate has filed. State law sets the
drawing on "the fourth Tuesday after the close of candidate filing". The Town
of Eleanor shall mark the drawing date on the back of the candidate filing form
and to notify candidates of the drawing date. Once the drawing has been held,
the ballot commissioners should meet to certify the ballot before it goes to
the printer.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.15  PRINTING BALLOTS.
   (a)   Authorized Printers.  Only those printers which have applied and
received approval as authorized ballot printers may contract with a
municipality to print ballots. The secretary of state provides the list of
authorized printers at the beginning of each election year, and updates the
list as new printers become authorized.
   (b)   Ballot Layout and Printing Specifications.  The law sets out the
requirements for ballot layout and printing, and the secretary of state issues
detailed specifications for ballot printing in the various voting systems. The
specifications include the requirements for paper, type sizes, layout,
instructions and other details and must be followed closely.
   (c)   Ballot Number and Packaging. The number of ballots printed must be
calculated exactly based on the number of registered voters in the
municipality. The number of each different ballot to be printed is as follows:
      (1)    Regular official ballots (paper) or ballot cards (punch) = 105% of
(l.05x) the number of registered voters eligible to vote the ballot; with 5%
packaged as office extras and ballots equaling 100% of the number of voters in
each precinct packaged for the precincts.
      (2)    Absentee ballots = The number of absentee and early ballots are
not specified in state law. 20 days prior to election, ANY voter may vote early
voting in-person.
      (3)    Sample ballots = 10 per precinct plus sufficient number for office
distribution. The ballots purchased for office extras are packaged and not
opened unless those ballots are required for use in an emergency. If the office
extra package is opened, careful documentation of the use of those ballots must
be made.
         (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.16  DESTRUCTION OF BALLOTS.
    No used or unused ballots may be destroyed until 22 months following the
election. This schedule allows you to destroy ballots (by fire or otherwise)
immediately before the next comparable election if you have elections each two
years. All voted ballots (including counted, spoiled, challenged and absentee
ballots) are not destroyed until 22 months following the election. However, a
determination is made on election night whether the number of unused ballots
remaining after voting corresponds to the number which should remain after the
voted, spoiled, challenged and absentee ballots are accounted for. If there is
a discrepancy, the unused ballots are kept secure until the discrepancy is
resolved in the canvass. The voting device ballot labels remain in the voting
device and sealed until they are needed for another election. In voting machine
systems, all voted paper ballots (absentee, challenged) are kept for 22 months
following the election. The voting machines remain sealed until seven days
after the canvass is concluded, after which time the counters may be reset to
zero, unless a court has ordered otherwise.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.17  PUBLICATION OF BALLOT.
   The sample ballot is required to be published as a Class I-O legal
advertisement in a qualified newspaper between 20-26 days prior to the day of
the election. A second publication, again as a Class I-O legal advertisement,
is required in the last day that the qualified newspaper is published before
the election. The second publication can be either the sample ballot or a list
of the candidates. If Eleanor has 2 or more daily qualified newspapers, you
must publish in the 2 newspapers of opposite political parties with the highest
circulation. If Eleanor only has one daily qualified newspaper or 1 or more
weekly qualified newspaper, the Town of Eleanor will be required to publish in
the newspaper with the highest circulation. Qualified newspapers must file with
the secretary of state's office. A qualified newspaper can accept legal
advertisements and must charge the rate as prescribed by West Virginia Code.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.18  REGISTRATION BOOKS.
   All voter registration records are processed by the clerk of the county
commission, regardless of whether the Town of Eleanor uses county registration
books or has separate municipal registration books. The municipal recorder can
supply voter registration mail in forms but has no authority to alter, transfer
or purge registrations. All of these functions are the duty of the county
clerk.
   (a)   Voter Registration Books.  At least one day before the Town of Eleanor
election, the registration records for the municipality must be picked up from
the county clerk's office. Within 10 days after the municipal election, the
registration records must be returned to the county clerk's office.
Registration records necessary for contests will be made available by the
county clerk. County precinct voter registration books are used in municipal
elections when the precinct boundaries are the same and all registrants are
entitled to vote in all elections. When only part of a county precinct is
within a municipality, voter registration records may be placed in a separate
book or section of the county precinct book. If a county precinct book does not
contain all registration records needed for a municipal election precinct,
precinct books may be used in combination with other precinct books to make up
a complete set of registration records for the municipal election precinct.
Separate municipal precinct books should only be used when county precinct
boundaries are divided by municipal or ward boundaries to the extent that it is
impossible to use county precinct books or separate municipal sections of those
precinct books. Separate registration books can cause serious problems if they
are not properly maintained. The municipal books must be an exact duplicate of
all voter registrations of persons living within the municipality.
   (b)   Changes Made to Registration Records.  Within thirty days following
the entry of any annexation order or change in street names or numbers, the
governing body of the Town of Eleanor must file with the clerk of the county
commission a certified current official municipality boundary map and a list of
streets and ranges of street numbers within the municipality to assist the
clerk in determining whether a voter's address is within the boundaries of the
municipality. The clerk of the county commission is responsible for processing
the voter registration records for both county and municipal precincts. No
registration record may be removed from a municipal registration record unless
the registration is lawfully transferred or canceled pursuant to West Virginia
Code. According to law, a person is only required to register once in order to
vote in all elections in which he or she is eligible. State law allows a
registered voter to change his/her name and/or address on the polling slip at
the polls on election day. If the registered voter has moved within the
municipality but outside his/her precinct, he/she must vote a challenged ballot
at his/her new precinct. An "inactive" voter may vote an unchallenged ballot at
his/her precinct. By voting, the voter restores his/her voting status to
"active". Remember, any change or correction to a voter's record is made by the
county clerk.
   (c)   Municipal Poll Slips.  After an election is certified, the recorder
should deliver the poll books containing the signatures of voters in that
election to the county clerk so the voting records may be corrected. This
process is necessary to be able to properly purge voter registration records.
   (d)   Registering Voters.  The Town of Eleanor recorder may distribute mail-
in voter registration forms to individuals. The deadline to register to vote in
any election is 20 days before that election. To do a registration drive before
a town election, you may contact the county clerk to see if a special
registration sitting can be offered by the clerk's staff within the town. Mail-
in voter registration applications may also be ordered from the supplier.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.19  ABSENTEE VOTING.
   The Town of Eleanor shall require a period for absentee voting by mail -
- beginning 42 days before the election. This six-week mandatory period exists
to accommodate military personnel and others who must apply for, receive and
return ballots from far away.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.20  ABSENTEE BALLOTING MATERIALS.
   All absentee balloting forms, envelopes and other material must be ordered
from the election supplier early in the year. The Town of Eleanor must supply
applications on request as early as 12 weeks before the election. If a local
form is used, it must be submitted it to the Secretary of State for approval.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.21  ABSENTEE VOTING BY MAIL SCHEDULE.
   (a)   After January 1 of election year, for any and all elections in that
year--from persons
outside the continental U. S. and all voters in the uniformed services
(including dependents). Those who use the federal application form and request
all ballots may receive the general and any special election ballots with just
one application. 84 days (12 weeks) before election -- from all other persons
Beginning 42 days before the election until the sixth day before the election.
After receiving the absentee ballot application the recorder sends the ballot:
      (1)    To a military or overseas voter,
      (2)    To a person voting absentee because of being out of the county on
election day and throughout the period of voting in person.
      (3)    To a person voting absentee because of physical illness,
disability or hospitalization making them unable to vote in person.
      (4)    To a person incarcerated in a detention facility but not under
conviction of a felony.
      (5)    To a person on personal or business travel, if the ballot is
mailed to an out of county address.
   (b)   When an application for a ballot by mail is received, the recorder
examines the application to determine if it is complete and that the voter
meets the requirements for voting by mail. The recorder then mails the ballot
to the voter. All voting materials must accompany the ballot according to the
voting system used. When voting by mail, two envelopes must also be sent to the
voter. One will contain the voter's information and the other will be a blank
envelope that is placed inside the voter information envelope. This will serve
to protect the voter's privacy. The permanent absentee voting record must be
maintained for all persons requesting an absentee ballot by mail. This record
should reflect all activity for the election cycle.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.22  GENERAL PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Applications.  Although requests for application forms may be accepted
by phone, a ballot may not be sent until the recorder receives a written
application giving the reason for voting absentee and the voter's signature.
Once a written application is received, a ballot must be sent, although it
would be challenged if the voter did not appear to be eligible to receive a
ballot.
   (b)   Special Absentee Voting List. A voter who is permanently disabled may
apply to be placed on the special absentee voting list (a physician's
certificate is required). Once this form is properly completed and filed, the
recorder is required to send voters on this list an application for voting
absentee. Municipal officials should request and use the county's special
absentee voting list for the town.
   (c)   Receiving Absentee Ballots by Mail. To be counted, ballots by mail
must be received by the close of the polls on election day -- or if postmarked
by the U. S. Postal Service by election day, received no later than the
beginning of the canvass. The recorder will be required to check at the post
office on election day to make sure all absentee ballots have been delivered. A
mailed ballot may be accepted without postmark if received on the day after the
election. No reference to postmark is made for military and overseas voters. A
person may hand deliver the absentee ballot of an absentee voter -- this is
especially useful when the voter is ill and has requested the ballot fairly
late. However, the ballot must be delivered to the recorder's office no later
than the day before the election, and one person may not hand deliver more than
two ballots. When a ballot is received, the date and manner received is entered
into the permanent absentee voting record. If the ballot is provisional, the
ballot is placed in a separate envelope to be kept secure until the canvass,
when the recorder will deliver it to the canvassing board. If the ballot is not
a provisional ballot, it is placed with other ballots according to procedures
for the voting system used.
   (d)   Emergency Absentee Voting.  Beginning seven days before the election
and ending on election day, with the request received no later than 12:00 noon
on election day. Voters in the hospital on election day, and depending on
county policy, those who reside in nursing homes, are eligible. This service is
only available to the patient, not family members. If there is a hospital in
the same county as the municipality, emergency absentee voting must be
available. If a voter is in the hospital on election day, he/she may request an
emergency absentee ballot.
   (e)   Ballots are Returned. No later than the close of polls on election
day, or if postmarked by the U. S. Postal Service no later than election day
and received before the beginning of the canvass.
      (1)   By mail to the recorder; no later than the day after the election
if there is no postmark
      (2)    By mail to the recorder; or no later than the day before the
election (for example, the Saturday before a Tuesday election).
   (f)   Provisional Absentee Ballots. When the voter is not eligible or the
requirements of law designed to protect the integrity of the ballots are not
met, the ballot is provisional. Judgment on the validity of the ballot is
determined at canvass. Absentee ballots may be marked provisional by the
recorder at several points in the process -- before a ballot is mailed or when
the mailed ballot is returned, or when a voter votes in person. The challenge
and the reason for it are entered on envelope #2, the record of the challenge
is entered in the permanent absentee voting record and the ballot is held by
the recorder to go directly to the canvassing board. It is the duty of the
recorder to provide a provisional ballot before the ballot is issued when:
      (1)    The application has not been completed as required by law (Note:
The key requirements for applications for ballots by mail are the voter's name,
residence address, an address outside the county to which the ballot is to be
mailed, if required, a valid reason for voting absentee, affidavit of the
sheriff if incarcerated, and signature. The absence of the precinct number or
correct election date are not reasons for challenge. For voting in person, the
recorder or clerk should check before issuing the ballot to make sure the
application is complete.); or
      (2)    The recorder has evidence the statements contained in the
application are not true; or
      (3)    The applicant is not registered in the town of Eleanor. The
recorder is required to provide a provisional ballot to a voter who votes in
person if the person receives assistance in voting but would have been able to
vote without assistance. The recorder is required to mark the absentee ballot
as provisional upon receipt of the ballot when:
         A.   The ballot envelope is not signed by the voter;
         B.   The person voted absentee by mail because of being out of town on
election day but the ballot was not mailed from out of town which is evidenced
by postmark or statement of voter (except for voters whose hours and distance
worked make it impossible to vote in- person);
         C.   The ballot is hand delivered after the day before the election,
or one person hand delivers more than two ballots;
         D.   The ballot is received after the close of the polls, with no
valid postmark, or after the beginning of canvass if postmarked by election
day.
            (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.23  EARLY VOTING IN PERSON.
   Early Voting In-Person: ("no excuse") Beginning 20 days before the election
and ending 3 days before the election (Note: For elections held on a Tuesday,
the recorder's office must be open on the last 2 Saturdays before the election
from 9 am - 5 pm.), any voter is permitted to vote during the early in person
voting period. A voter does not have to provide a reason for voting during this
time. This is very beneficial to voters who will be out of town on election
day, those who are scheduled to be hospitalized on election day, and those who
are working as election officials in a different precinct. There can be no
electioneering in recorder's office or property of town hall during this time.
   (a)   Issuing Ballots: When a voter appears in person to vote during the
early voting period, the procedure is much like that on election day. The voter
will complete and sign the poll slip. The ballot is then issued according to
procedures established for the voting system used. After voting, the voter cast
the ballot into the ballot box. The permanent absentee voting record must be
maintained for all persons voting early in person. This record should reflect
all activity for the election cycle.
   (b)   Processing Absentee and Early Voting Ballots.   At the close of polls,
ballots voted early in person and absentee ballots are processed according
procedures for the voting systems used. If you use paper ballots, absentee
ballots and ballots voted during the early voting period are processed at the
polling place. These ballots should be included in the precinct supplies for
the polling place. If paper ballots are used and if a counting board is used,
specific procedures must be followed. It is extremely important in this
situation that No one is allowed in the counting board room during the day or
that members of the counting board speak to persons outside of the counting
board room about the tally of votes being cast. This is a violation of the oath
and is, therefore, a misdemeanor.  If you use an electronic voting system,
absentee ballots and ballots voted during the early voting period are processed
at the central counting center. Ballots must be reviewed for write-in votes by
a resolution team that consists of two persons of opposite political parties.
The counting center is open to the public. However, no one except authorized
election workers may handle election materials and ballots.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.24  ELIGIBILITY OF ELECTION OFFICIALS.
   To work as an election official, a person may not be a candidate in the
election, or be the parent, child, sibling or spouse of a candidate, may not be
a person prohibited from serving by any statute or may not have been previously
convicted of a violation of any election law. State and county classified or
civil service employees are not permitted to work as election officials.
Employees of the county commission and board of education and other non-
classified employees may serve. Federal Hatch Act employees are not prohibited
from serving as election officials.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.25  NUMBER OF ELECTION OFFICIALS.
   (a)   Receiving Boards.  For the Town of Eleanor elections, there must be a
receiving board consisting of four officials -- two poll clerks and two
election commissioners. For all elections, the poll clerks working with the
registration records cannot be from the same political party. The election
commissioners working at the ballot box cannot be from the same political
party.
   (b)   Counting Boards. In the Town of Eleanor when using paper ballots, the
governing body may determine whether a counting board will be appointed for
more than 200 registered voters. The counting board consists of two clerks and
three commissioners. The receiving board performs the duties of the counting
board after the election if no counting board has been appointed. In this case,
counting cannot begin until the polls close.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.26  APPOINTMENT OF OFFICIALS.
    The Town of Eleanor governing body appoints election officials no later
than the 49th day before the election. The governing body should also appoint
additional alternates, and determine how many alternates should attend
training.
   (a)   Notice of Appointment. The recorder is required to mail notices to
every person appointed as an election official within seven days following the
appointment. The appointed offficial must respond within fourteen days
following appointment and state whether or not they will serve. If a person
fails to respond in time, the recorder appoints a replacement from the
alternate list or, after all alternates have been used, any eligible voter.
   (b)   Training Requirements.  No person may serve as an election official
unless he or she has attended instruction, which includes a showing of the
election training program produced by the secretary of state. Written notice of
the date on which the training will be given and notice that they must attend
the training in order to work at the polls should be included with their notice
of appointment. Those who fail to attend (except in emergency circumstances)
should be replaced. A make-up training session should be held before the
election if any officials are untrained. In a last minute emergency, such as a
cancellation immediately before or on election day, a person may be appointed
who has not received the training. The regular training must be held at least 7
days before the election.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.27  PAY OF ELECTION OFFICIALS.
   The town council sets the pay of election officials, and the maximum allowed
by law is $175.00 for election day and $125.00  for training. Alternates are
compensated for election training if appointed as an election official. If the
recorder instructs an alternate to attend a training session and they do so,
and are available to serve at the polls on election day, they may receive
election training pay. Alternates who refuse to serve may not receive election
official pay.
   (a)   Contributions and Loans. Campaign finance reporting is that every cent
received must be reported by name of contributor and the amount, no matter how
small. Some other requirements are:
      (1)   Contributions are limited to $1000.00 per person, per election,
except that candidates may contribute as much of their own personal funds as
they want to their own campaign.
      (2)    Contributions over $50.00 must be made by check, money order or
credit card. Cash over $50.00 can not be accepted.
      (3)    Single or aggregate contributions (the total amount contributed
for one election year) of $250.00 or more require that the name, address, and
occupation of the contributor be listed in the financial report.
      (4)    Corporate contributions, whether in cash, materials or services,
are prohibited. However, registered corporate political action committees can
donate money.
      (5)    When having fundraisers, all money collected must be itemized by
contributor and amount. Otherwise, it is considered to be an anonymous
contribution and must be paid over to the state general fund.
      (6)    Non-monetary contributions -- known as in-kind contributions -
- such as material for signs, office space, postage, photocopies, food,
transportation or services paid for by the contributor -- are subject to the
same limits, prohibitions and reporting requirements as money.
         (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.28  CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS.
   (a)   Reporting Periods.  Candidates, political committees, and individuals
who spend money to support a candidate or group are required to file reports
detailing their financial activity with the city clerk or recorder's office.
The campaign finance statement is used for campaign finance reporting.
Depending on the type of activity, candidates or committees may use the long
form (F-7) or the short form (F-7A). Those who hold fundraisers, or who make or
receive loans or in-kind contributions must use the long form. Reports must be
filed according to the following timelines:
      (1)    Pre election 10-17 days before election
      (2)    Post-election 25-31 days after election
   A campaign account cannot be closed unless it has a zero balance and all
loans and bills are paid. 
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.29  POLLING HOURS.
   State law requires that the polls be open from 6:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. for
all elections.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.30  WHO MAY ENTER POLLS.
   Unauthorized people are not allowed to enter the polling place during the
hours the polls are open or the ballots are being counted. The law limits those
authorized to enter, specifying only the following:
   (a)    A person entering to vote.
   (b)    A person providing assistance to an illiterate or disabled voter who
cannot vote alone.
   (c)    The recorder or clerk, on official business.
   (d)    The county clerk, county prosecutor, or secretary of state, or full
time employees of those officials.
   Family members of poll-workers, candidates, people delivering lunch, members
of the press, and political workers are not allowed to enter the polling
building, except when entering to vote. Voters should not be allowed to loiter
in the polling place after casting a ballot.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.31  300-FOOT CAMPAIGN FREE ZONE.
   (a)   No electioneering is permitted within 300 feet of the entrance door of
the polling building. On election morning, election officials are required to
measure this area and post a sign designating the boundary. The measurement is
made along normal access ways, but the zone refers to the entire area within
300 feet of the door in all directions. This prohibition means workers may not
pass out campaign literature or approach voters, whether to advocate a
candidate or issue or to simply "check" the name or party of those voting. It
also prevents campaign signs, stickers or other paraphernalia within the zone.
Drivers may deliver voters within the 300-foot area, but any campaign signs
(except bumper stickers) must be taken off before entering the zone, and the
driver must immediately leave the zone and wait until the voters have finished
to reenter to pick them up. Drivers who deliver handicapped voters who will
need assistance entering the polling place may park within the zone while
helping the voter. Media representatives with credentials (including reporters
and-photographers from newspapers, television, radio, and representatives of
polling services) may be positioned within the 300-foot zone to interview
voters coming and going to the polls. However, they may not campaign and they
may not enter the polling building or photograph through windows into the
polling room.
   (b)   Violations of the 300-foot rule are punishable by prosecution.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.32  PROCEDURES AT THE POLLS.
   The process of checking in voters, issuing ballots, handling assisted
voters, issuing provisional ballots, closing the polls, counting ballots and
other steps for election commissioners and poll clerks are spelled out in
detail in the election training program produced by the secretary of state. If
the Town of Eleanor uses the same voting system as the county, the county clerk
can loan this training program early so the recorder can review these
procedures. If the Town of Eleanor uses a different voting system than the
county, the training information can be obtained from the secretary of state.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.33  COUNTING BALLOTS.
   (a)   Paper Ballot Systems. Paper ballots are to be counted at the polling
place. If a counting board is used, the counting begins at 9:30 a.m. or as soon
after that as 25 ballots are in the box. If a single board is used, the ballot
box is not opened and no counting occurs until after the poll is closed. In
counting paper ballots, a ballot which is not signed by the two poll clerks is
not counted at the polls. It is marked provisional and counted at canvass
according to those procedures. A vote is counted for a candidate if the
intention of the voter can be determined. The  courts have given some basic
guidance about this:
      (1)   The mark need not be an X in the box, but any mark which clearly
shows the voter's choice must be counted.
      (2)   If two votes are cast for a single office, this is an over vote and
both must be rejected.
      (3)   For write-in votes, the write-in vote must be placed on the face of
the ballot; the write-in vote must include the name and the office:
      (4)   The intention of the voter shall be deemed to be clear if the
write-in vote cast for an office contains both the first and last name of an
official write in candidate for that office;
      (5)   If no two of ficial write-in candidates for an of fice share a
first or last name, either the first name or last name alone shall be deemed to
express the clear intention of the voter;
      (6)   The office intended may be shown by the position where the write in
is placed or be specifically written in.
   Stickers and stamps are acceptable means of making write-in votes.
   (b)   Electronic Ballot Systems.  The ballot box is not opened at the
polling place. When all ballots are inside, the opening is covered with a paper
seal and returned to the central counting center, At the central counting
center, the ballot box is opened and ballots in envelopes which do not contain
write-in votes are separated and prepared for tabulation. Ballots containing
write-in votes are handled according to proper procedures.  Valid write-in
votes are tallied and the ballot cards added to those ready for tabulation. The
rules for counting write-ins are basically the same as those described above
for paper ballots. The voter's intent must be considered when making a
determination.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.34  WHO CONDUCTS THE CANVASS.
   Elections ordered and held by the Town of Eleanor, including elections of
officers and special elections, are canvassed by the governing body of the Town
of Eleanor. All voting members of the governing body (which includes the mayor
and recorder) act in the capacity of a board of canvassers. There must be a
quorum to conduct the canvass. If there is not a quorum, the meeting must be
rescheduled when a quorum can be present. The canvass is a public meeting.
Although some of the sitting members of the governing body may also be
candidates on the ballot in the election, they still participate in the
canvass, for which they have an official responsibility.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.35  SCHEDULING THE CANVASS.
   The canvass of the general election begins on the fifth day, not counting
Sunday, following the election. Do not begin the canvass on a Saturday, Sunday
or legal holiday, but do count a Saturday or holiday when counting the five
days.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.36  CONVENING, RECESSING AND ADJOURNING THE CANVASS.
   The canvass is called as a special meeting for the appropriate day. If the
canvass cannot be completed on the first day, it must continue from day to day
(reconvening on each business day) until it is completed. Notice of the date
and hour of convening the canvass should be given in the normal manner for
giving the required notices of special meetings, and all meetings must be open
to the public. A quorum of the governing body must be present to conduct the
canvass as the board of canvassers. If a quorum is not present at any session,
the meeting should be recessed until the next business day (not a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday), at which time the board of canvassers must reconvene
and begin again. When the canvass is completed, the results of the election are
declared, and the canvass is recessed for at least 48 hours (excluding any
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday which falls within that period). After the 48
hours is past, the board of canvassers convenes to certify the results of the
election for any office or issue for which no recount request has been filed.
If no office or issue is the subject of a recount request, all results are
certified and the board of canvassers adjourns.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.37  CONDUCTING THE CANVASS.
   The goal of the canvassing process is to obtain the true result of the
election. However, in this process, ballots are not re-tallied and allegations
of fraud or improprieties are not heard -- those steps come later. The steps of
a canvass are designed to create a record verifying that the ballots are
properly accounted for, and to make a determination about whether provisional
ballots can be counted based on information available within the election
materials. The board of canvassers may call in and question the election
officials from the precinct if necessary, but they may not accept testimony
from voters, candidates or other relating to matters outside the documents
pertaining to the election. Every municipal election canvass must be conducted
according to the Procedural Rules of the Secretary of State. All the materials
of the election are brought before the board of canvassers.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.38  THE ESSENTIAL STEPS OF THE CANVASS.
   (a)   Verifying the Ballots.
      (1)   In all systems, the first step is to make sure the precinct record
showing the number of voters (the poll book) and the number of voted ballots
(including both counted and provisional ballots) correspond.
      (2)   For paper ballots, count the actual voted and provisional ballots
by hand (without examining them) and compare that total number to the number of
signed poll slips.
      (3)   For electronically counted ballots, compare the number of signed
poll slips to the total number of ballots tabulated plus the provisional
ballots (these numbers will also appear on the precinct 'Statement of Ballots
Used').
      (4)   For lever machines, compare the number of signed poll slips to the
total number of voters on the return sheet plus the provisional ballots. If the
numbers don't correspond, the board of canvassers must try to resolve the
discrepancy.
   The board of canvassers will also check to make sure the record of the
number of provisional, spoiled and unused ballots, along with all voted
ballots, corresponds to the total number of ballots.
   (b)   Verifying the Precinct Election Results.  The board of canvassers
checks to make sure the number of votes reported for each candidate corresponds
to the other records of votes cast. In paper ballot systems, the votes for each
candidate marked on the two tally sheets are compared to the votes reported on
the certificate of returns. If they don't match, the board must try to
determine where the discrepancy lies, without recounting the ballots. In lever
machine systems, the counters on the voting machines must be examined and
compared to the return sheets. If they don't match, the returns should be
corrected to match the counters on the voting machines.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.39  DETERMINING THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS. 
   The board of canvassers must examine each provisional ballot envelope and
associated records (such as the registration record or application for absentee
ballot). After examining the reason for voting provisional and the voter's
registration card, they must determine whether there is evidence to remove the
challenge and count the ballot, or whether the challenge should be sustained.
The key to this decision is whether the voter is properly registered, is
eligible to cast a ballot in the election, and has followed proper procedures.
The board of canvassers may not simply decide to count or not count all
provisional ballots on the theory it won't make any difference to the outcome.
Voters who are legally registered, entitled to vote and have met the
requirements of law as to procedure (such as the requirement to show ID in the
first election after registering by postcard registration, or absentee voting
requirements) must have their ballots counted.  (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.40  CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION RESULTS.
    All offices, except those subject to a recount request, should be certified
as soon as possible after the 48-hour period has passed. Those subject to
recount are certified at the conclusion of the recount. The certification of
the results of the election must be made in the form set out in West Virginia
Code.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.41  BREAKING A TIE.
   If the results of any election are tied, and no recount is requested or the
tie is not broken during a recount, the tie shall be decided by lot. The
drawing or other procedure by lot is conducted by the board of canvassers. The
board then certifies the winner as being elected.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.42  THE REQUEST FOR A RECOUNT.
   Only a candidate may request a recount, and when a candidate wants a recount
in his or her race, the candidate must do two things:
   (a)   File a written request for a recount within 48 hours after the
declaration of the results (again, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays are
excluded);
   (b)   File, also within 48 hours, a bond "in a reasonable amount with good
sufficient surety to guarantee payment of the costs and the expenses of such
recount," but not to exceed $300. This may be a cash, personal property or
other bond, with the amount set by the Town of Eleanor. To make this process
fair, the Town of Eleanor governing body should determine at the canvass the
amount of the bond to be required in case of a recount request. The law does
not appear to allow the bond to be waived.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.43  NOTICE TO OTHER CANDIDATES.
   When a recount request is properly filed within the 48-hour period, the
board of canvassers has an additional 24 hours at the end of the 48 hours in
which to send notice to all candidates for the office for which the recount is
requested, giving the date, time and place of the recount. The time for the
recount can be no sooner than three days after the notice is served. The
sheriff of the county (or the sheriff's designee) is required to serve and make
return of the notice according to the procedure set out in West Virginia Code
§3-6-9.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.44  OTHER CANDIDATES PRESERVE RIGHT TO RECOUNT.
   Although a losing candidate requests a recount, that candidate has the right
to stop the recount at any point in the process. Suppose the losing candidate
is one vote behind the winner, and after recounting one precinct the loser
pulls ahead by one vote. This candidate could stop the recount at that point
and become the winner, unless the original winning candidate has preserved the
right to continue the recount. After the other candidates in the race have
received notice of the recount, any of those candidates (usually the winner or
winners) who want to protect their rights in the recount must also file, within
24 hours of receiving the notice:
   (a)    A written notice to the board of canvassers of their intention to
preserve the right to demand a recount of precincts not requested by the
candidate originally requesting the recount; and,
   (b)    A bond in the same amount as required of the first candidate.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.45  CONDUCTING THE RECOUNT.
   When recount is conducted by the board of canvassers, these basic rules
apply:
   (a)   Only the votes cast for the one race which is the subject of the
recount are tallied.
   (b)   Each precinct may only be recounted one time.
   (c)   The recount is conducted in the same manner as the votes were
originally counted, except that in electronically tabulated ballot systems, the
person requesting the recount may specify that the ballots be counted by hand.
   (d)   If the candidate who originally requested the recount stops the
process, any other candidate who has preserved the right to a recount may then
request that the recount continue. This request must be made at the completion
of the recounting a precinct.
   (e)   When the recount is stopped or completed, the board of canvassers then
certifies the result.
      (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.46  WHO BEARS THE COST OF THE RECOUNT.
   The actual cost of the recount should be determined by calculating any
municipal employees' salary and/or officials pay or expenses specifically for
the meeting conducted for the recount. If no staff time is used and officers do
not receive "per meeting" pay or expenses, the recount may not cost anything.
If the entire recount is conducted based on the original request, that
candidate must pay the costs only if the outcome of the election is not
changed. In other words, if the losing candidate requesting the recount still
loses, that candidate pays the cost. If that person wins, the municipality
bears the cost. If the original candidate stops the recount and another person
asks that it continue, the costs of each portion of the process are divided
proportionally between the two -- but again, each candidate is responsible for
paying only if the winner does not change during the portion for which they are
responsible. The bond is refunded or released after costs, if required, are
paid.  (Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.47  CONTEST.
   When a losing candidate wishes to contest certain matters in the election,
the contest
procedure must be used. Contests usually must be very specific. For example,
the contestant may challenge the decision of the board of canvassers to count
or reject  particular provisional ballots or, the decision whether to count or
reject a certain mark or vote on a ballot. If the issue is the eligibility of
the winning candidate, the contestant may specify that issue. In some rare
cases, the overall integrity of the election may be challenged, but a contest
may not be based on general allegations of fraud unless the contestant is
prepared to present specific evidence leading to the conclusion that the fraud
was sufficient to change the outcome of the election.
   For example, a candidate has evidence that two ineligible persons were
allowed to cast ballots which were counted. However, the smallest difference
between the winning and losing candidates in any office is 100 votes. Even
though some fraud may have occurred, in this example, it would not have changed
who was elected. A candidate who wishes to contest the results of his or her
race must file a notice of contest within 10 days following the certification
of the results of the election for that office. The law (and a number of court
cases) require that the notice of contest be quite specific and properly
written, so candidates should consider contacting a lawyer. If a notice of
contest is filed, the municipal governing body should also contact an attorney
to assist them in complying with the procedures, notice requirements, and
contest proceedings. A candidate may appeal the results of an election contest
to circuit court.
(Ord. 05-07.  Passed 10-20-05.)
105.48  TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE; BEGINNING THE NEW TERMS; BONDS.
   Every elected official must take the oath of office before beginning their
duties. The oath
must be taken after the certification of the election and before the date of
the beginning of the term of office. The oath may be taken before the mayor,
recorder, or any official authorized to give oaths (a judge, magistrate, clerk
of any court of record, notary public), and must be filed with the recorder of
the municipality. A certified copy of the oath is also filed with the clerk of
the county commission. Persons elected to full terms take office on July 1, and
persons elected to fill unexpired terms take office as soon as the election is
certified. Municipal officers and employees who handle public funds or property
shall give bond, with good security, to be approved by the Council, and in such
penalty as the Council prescribes. If a candidate elected decides to vacate the
office, this is now considered a vacancy and will be filled by Council, the
candidate with the next highest votes does not automatically take office.

141.01  RACIAL PROFILING POLICY.
   (a)   Policy.  The West Virginia legislature has declared that racial
profiling, as a law enforcement tactic is contrary to public policy and should
not be used as an investigative strategy. No officer employed by the Eleanor
Police Department shall engage in racial profiling. At the same time, it is the
policy of the Town of Eleanor to patrol in a proactive manner, to aggressively
investigate suspicious persons and circumstances, and to actively enforce all
laws. The Town of Eleanor insists, however, that citizens will only be stopped
or detained when there exists reasonable suspicion to believe they have
committed, are committing, or are about to commit, an infraction of the law.
   (b)   Purpose.    The purpose of this policy is to unequivocally state that
profiling based solely on race in law enforcement is unacceptable, to provide
guidelines for officers to prevent racial profiling, and to protect our
officers from unwarranted accusations when they act within the dictates of the
law and policy.
   (c)   Procedures.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   Racial profiling. The practice of a law enforcement officer
relying, to any degree, on race, ethnicity, or national origin in selecting
which individuals to subject to routine investigatory activities, or in
deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement activity following the
initial routine investigatory activity. Racial profiling does not include
reliance on race, ethnicity, or national origin in combination with other
identifying factors when the law enforcement officer is seeking to apprehend a
specific suspect whose race, ethnicity, or national origin is part of the
description of the suspect.
         B.   Reasonable suspicion. Also known as articulable suspicion,
suspicion that is more than a mere hunch, but is based on a set of articulable
facts and circumstances that would warrant a person of reasonable caution in
believing that an infraction of the law has been committed, is about to be
committed, or is in the process of being committed, by the person or persons
under suspicion. This can be based on the observation of a police officer
combined with his or her training and experience, and/or outside sources.
      (2)   Operations.
         A.   The Eleanor Police Department will be directed toward assigning
patrol officers to those areas where there is the highest likelihood that motor
vehicle accidents will be reduced and or crimes prevented through proactive
patrol.
         B.   Officers should receive training in proactive enforcement
tactics, including training in officer safety, courtesy, cultural diversity,
the laws governing search and seizure, and interpersonal communication skills.
         C.   Training programs should emphasize the need to respect the rights
of all citizens to be free from unreasonable government intrusion or police
action.
         D.   Supervisory oversight will be provided consistently to ensure
that officers comply with this policy.
         E.   Citizens shall only be subject to traffic stops, stop and frisks,
questioning, search and seizures upon reasonable suspicion that they have
committed, are committing, or are about to commit an infraction.
         F.   The Eleanor Police Department recognizes that with experience,
individual officers may develop individualized approaches that they find work
best for them in minimizing conflict during officer/violator contacts. Given
some better approach, the following is recommended, in the order specified
below:
            1.   Give a greeting, such as "Good Morning ma'am" or sir, etc.
            2.   State the reason why the person was stopped.
            3.   Politely ask for identification and any required documents.
            4,   After completing any necessary paperwork, inform the citizen
as to what action is being taken and what, if any, the person must do as a
result.
            5.   Be polite within the realm of reasonableness while paying
attention to officer security. Never use the trite expression, " Have a nice
day".
         G.   No citizen, once cited or warned, shall be detained  beyond the
point where there exists no reasonable  suspicion of further criminal activity,
and no person or vehicle shall be searched in the absence of a warrant, a
legally recognized exception to the warrant requirement, or the person's
voluntary consent. In each case where a search is conducted, this information
shall be recorded, including the legal basis for the search, and the results
thereof. A case report or incident report shall be initiated for each search.
         H.   In the absence of a specific, credible report containing a
physical description, a person's race shall not be a factor in determining
probable cause for an arrest or reasonable suspicion for a stop.
         I.   If at any time the citizen expresses concern or alludes to racial
profiling the officer shall continue his duty, search,  etc. In addition:
            1.   The officer shall notify his immediate supervisor of the
incident as soon as possible.
            2.   The officer shall explain to the citizen the process of filing
a complaint with the Chief Administrative Officer.
      (3)   Complaints of Racial/Ethnic Profiling.
         A.   Any person may file a complaint with the Town of Eleanor if they
feel they have been subject to racial profiling, and no person shall be
discouraged, intimidated, or coerced from filing such a complaint, or
discriminated against because they have filed such a complaint.
         B.   Any officer contacted by a person who wishes to file such a
complaint, shall provide the citizen with the name and number of the officer
who receives complaints. The officer shall make an effort to gain the name and
address of the citizen requesting the information. This information shall be
given to the officer who receives complaints before completion of the officer's
shift.
         C.   Any officer receiving a written report shall mark same with a
date and time notation and forward it to the officer who receives complaints.
Receipt of the complaint shall be acknowledged in writing.
         D.   All racial profiling complaints shall be reviewed and an
investigation conducted by the Police Commission. The resulting report, with
the Commission's conclusion, shall be filed with the Chief Administrative
Officer, and may contain suggestions for disciplinary action or changes in
policy, training, or tactics. The complainant shall be notified in writing of
the results and findings of the investigation.
         E.   Supervisors shall review complaints, periodically review a
sampling of in car video tapes of stops, reports filed on stops by officer, and
respond at random to back up officers, and shall take appropriate action
whenever it appears that this policy is being violated, being particularly
alert to any pattern of practice of possible discriminatory treatment by
individual officers.
         F.   Officers who engage in racial profiling will be disciplined in
accordance with departmental policy and civil rules as appropriate.

jurisdiction, it shall be lawful for the Municipal Judge, Mayor, Chief of
Police or the Town Recorder to admit such person to bail upon the execution of
a bond to the Town in such an amount as in the discretion of the official will

accounted for; and in the event of the forfeiture of a penal bond, the Town
Recorder shall forthwith take the steps necessary at law for the collection
thereof.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the admission
of a person to bail upon his own recognizance when such is authorized by law

to do so.

security for any person’s appearance shall be deposited with the Town Recorder
to be by him safely kept until the next regular session of the Municipal Court,
when it shall be turned over to the Judge of the Municipal Court and disposed
of by the Judge as required by the bond and this and the preceding section.

any process, order, or notice therein.
      (4)   Disobedience or resistance of an officer, witness, party or other
person to any lawful process, judgment, order or notice of the Municipal Judge.
   (b)   Arrest and Prosecution.  An order to arrest may be issued by the
Municipal Judge on which the person charged with the contempt may be taken and
brought before him, or such person may be taken into custody by any officer or
any person upon the oral order of the Municipal Judge and held to answer for
the contempt.  An opportunity must be given the person charged to be heard in
defense or explanation of his conduct, and the Municipal Judge may thereupon
discharge him, or adjudge him guilty of the contempt and punish him therefor,
by fine or imprisonment, or both.  The fine shall not be exceed fifty dollars
($50.00), nor the imprisonment of five days.  The Municipal Judge shall not
impose a fine for contempt unless the defendant be present in court, or shall
have been served with a rule of the court to show cause, on some certain day,
and shall have failed to appear and show cause.
   (c)   Judgment and Commitment.  The conviction for contempt, specifying the
particular circumstances of the offense and judgment thereon, must be entered
by the Municipal Judge in his docket.  A warrant of commitment for the term of
imprisonment adjudged may be issued by the Municipal Judge commanding an

imprisonment of Town prisoners, and the keeper thereof to imprison him therein

      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:

or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be

can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.

the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)

movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection

signs.

declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other

   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses under this
section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of this section or under a prior enactment of this section for an
offense which occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the
date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)   Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this State or any
other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an

ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) for violation of subsection (c) of this section, which
violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant or indictment or information for
a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   For purposes of this section, the term “controlled substance” has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.
   (o)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or
subsequent offense:  provided, however, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of second offense under this
section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five days of
the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave
home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code
62-11B-5:  provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered
for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation  of this section,
electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten days of the total
period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for
those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5. 
(WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (p)   As used in subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this
section, the words “drives a vehicle in this Municipality” do not mean or
include driving or operating a vehicle solely and exclusively on one’s own
property.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (q)   For purposes of this section, the phrase "in this Municipality" means
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this Municipality, including, but
not limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision
streets or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use
of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (r)   When used in this section, the terms or phrases "driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor," "driving or operating a motor vehicle while
intoxicated," "for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor
to drive any vehicle," or any similar term or phrase shall be construed to mean
and be synonymous with the term or phrase "while under the influence of
alcohol...drives a vehicle" as the latter term or phrase is used in this
section.
   (s)   A warrant or indictment which charges or alleges an offense,
prohibited by the provisions of this section, and which warrant or indictment
uses any of the terms or phrases set forth in subsection (r) hereof, shall not
thereby be fatally defective if such warrant or indictment otherwise informs
the person so accused of the charges against him.  (WVaC 17C-5-2a)
333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under Section
333.01 or any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (c) of Section
333.01, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any
provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which
conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-
3a.  Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165 days after he
or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to
West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-2.
   
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.   
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Test and Lock
Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statue of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provision, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objection on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01  or West Virginia Code 17C- 5, discharge and dismissal under this
section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for
purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of
a crime except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1, et seq. 
Except as provided in subsection (j), (k) and (l) of Section
333.01  regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and
discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status
he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing or otherwise giving false statement by reason of his or
her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response
to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made
in connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in subsection
(l) of Section
333.01 .
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (g)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of
Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s);
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(a) or under any statute of the United States
or of any state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any
controlled substance or any other drug; or
      (4)   If the person refused the secondary chemical test pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-7.
   (h)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of subsection (c) of Section
333.01, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court cost assessable against a person convicted of
subsection (i) of Section
333.01.  Payment of such costs may be made a condition of probation.  The costs
assessed pursuant to this subsection, whether as a term of probation or not,
shall be distributed as other court costs in accordance with relevant municipal
ordinances and state statutes.

   (a)   No person shall drive any vehicle upon any street or highway, or upon
any residential street, or in any parking area, or upon the ways of any

of the Board of Education, or upon any property within the Municipal park and
public recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of
persons or property.
   (b)   The provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to those areas

345.35  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (a)   A person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years
of age, and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is
restrained by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety
standards.  For the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor
vehicle which is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including
the driver, except that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or
any motor vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this
section under a federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a
belt system.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger
vehicles manufactured after the first day of January, 1967, and being 1968
models and newer.
   (b)   The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.
   (e)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to abrogate or
alter the provisions of Section
345.31 relating to the mandatory use of child passenger safety devices.

Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers

illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on

365.01  SHORT TITLE.
   This article may be cited as "Junked Vehicle Ordinance".
(Ord. 11-02.  Passed 2-17-11.)
365.02  PURPOSES AND INTENTS.
   It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally
clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance
of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and
businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept
community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy
environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live.
Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean,
remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from
occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage
a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores,
and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article
seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and
aesthetics of properties against a person's actions or property constituting a
violation of the conditions of this article.

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

following acts of the minor child:

   (d)   The willful taking, stealing and carrying away of the property of
another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.
   For purposes of this section, "custodial parent or parents" means the parent
or parents with whom the minor child is living, or a divorced or separated
parent who does not have legal custody but who is exercising supervisory
control over the minor child at the time of the minor child's act.

taxable court costs, and interest from date of judgment.  The right of action
and remedy granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any
rights of action and remedies therefor against a parent or parents for the

representative shall contact the property owner by first class mall or in
person. Such property owner is according to the owner of record as listed on

30 days of the date of address notification or number delivery, whichever
applies.
      (6)   Street renaming procedures: If a street renaming is required, it
should occur prior to official assignment of a street address to ease property

929.09  GREASE TRAPS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to control discharges into
the public sewerage collection system and wastewater treatment plant that
interfere with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of
pipelines, interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and
contribute waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment
difficulties or is beyond the treatment capability of the wastewater treatment
plant.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Grease - Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease (FOG)
from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and grease shall be
deemed as Grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleum based
products.
      (2)   Grease Trap -A device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and  grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also
serve to collect settable solids, generated by and from food preparation
activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer
collection and treatment system.
      (3)   Food Service Facilities - Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and that use one of more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing,
rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting,
toasting, or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing,
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food
product in or on a receptacle that requires washing, These facilities include
restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing
plants, or any other sewer users as determined by the Town's Wastewater
Collection System Superintendent (WCSS) who discharge applicable waste.
      (4)   User  - Any person or establishment including those located outside
the jurisdictional limits of the Town who contributes, causes, or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater in the Town's wastewater collection or
treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
      (5)   Oil/Water Separator - An approved, industry standard system that is
specifically designed, and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system
shall allow the oil to  be collected and removed on a regular basis as to
prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only
oil/water separators manufactured for that specific operation will be
approved.  Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required
so as to allow a proper review by the WCSS.
   
   (c)   Control Plan for (FOG) and Food Waste. 
      (1)   Any new construction, renovation or expansion of Food Service
Facilities shall be required to submit to the Town a FOG and food waste control
plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into
the wastewater collection system.
      (2)   Any existing Food Service Facilities shall also be required to
submit a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the
discharge of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
Existing facilities shall not be exempt from the requirement of this article.
There will be no "Grandfathering".
   (d)   General Criteria.
      (1)   Installation Requirements.  All existing, proposed, or newly
remodeled Food Service Facilities that are tied onto our sanitary sewer lines
service area shall be required to install, at the user's expense, an approved,
properly operated and maintained grease trap.
      (2)   Sanitary Sewer Flows.  Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows
shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
      (3)   Floor Drains.  Only floor drains which discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
      (4)   Garbage Grinders/Disposers.  It is recommended that solid food
waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal
means. If a grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap.
The use of grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity
of the grease trap and will require an increase pumping frequency to ensure
continuous and effective operation.
      (5)   Dishwashers.  Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the
grease trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and
allow it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized
accordingly to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to
solidify and float to the top of the trap.
      (6)   Location.  Grease traps shall be installed outside the building
upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow
easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at
any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building
without written approval by the WCSS.
      (7)   Pass Through Limits.  No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from grease trap to exceed 100MgPL (milligrams per liter) as
identified by EPA method 413.
   (e)   Design Criteria.
      (1)   Construction.  Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with
The Town of Eleanor's standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments
with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal devises or
technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the WCSS or Plant
Superintendent. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal
efficiencies of the proposed technology.
      (2)   Access.  Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to
allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to trap shall be provided by
two manholes (one on each compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast
iron frame and cover.
      (3)   Load-Bearing Capacity.  In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas).
      (4)   Inlet and Outlet Piping.  Wastewater discharging to a grease trap
shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall
have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
      (5)   Grease Trap Sizing.  The required size of the grease trap shall be
calculated using EPA-2 model. All grease traps shall have a capacity of not
less the 500 gal. nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gal. If the calculated
capacity exceeds 3,000 gal., multiple units plumbed in series shall be
installed.
   (f)   Grease Trap Maintenance.
      (1)   Cleaning/Pumping.  The user at the user's expense shall maintain
all grease traps to assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain
compliance with the Town's Pass Through Limits. Maintenance of grease trap
shall include the complete removal of all content, including floating
materials, wastewater, and bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be
performed by a qualified and licensed hauler. Decanting or discharging of
removed waste back into the trap from which it was removed or any other grease
trap, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.
This service shall also include a thorough inspection of the trap and its
components.  Any needed repairs shall be noted. Repairs shall be made at the
user's expense.
      (2)   Cleaning/Pumping Frequency.  The grease trap must be pumped out
completely a minimum of once every four months, or more frequently, as
determined by the WCSS, as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the
sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Disposal.  All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed
of at a facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the
provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any
private or public portion of the Town's sanitary sewer collection system. All
pumpage from grease traps must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms
pumping, hauling, and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and retain a
copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
      (4)   Maintenance Log.  A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating
each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each Food
Service Facility. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler,
and disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location of inspection.
Said log shall be made available to the WCSS or his representative upon
request.
      (5)   Submittal of Records. 
         A.   Each user shall submit all cleaning and maintenance records to
the WCSS. The maintenance records shall include the following information:
            1.    Facility name, address, contact person, and telephone number.

         B.   The user shall be required to submit maintenance records to the
WCSS on a biannual basis (twice per year). Records shall be  submitted by March
1st and September 1st of each year. The records shall be submitted to: The Town
of Eleanor, Attn: Wastewater Collection System Superintendent, P.O. Box 185,
Eleanor, WV 25070
         C.   The WCSS will perform periodic inspections of these facilities
and shall notify the user of any additional required maintenance or repairs.
Upon written notification by the WCSS, the user shall be required to perform
the maintenance and records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. Upon
inspection by the WCSS, the user may be required to install, at his own
expense, additional controls to provide a complete system which prevents
discharges of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
   (g)   Additives.  Any biological additive(s) placed into the grease trap or
building discharge line including but not limited to, enzymes, commercially
available bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb, purge, consume,
treat, or otherwise eliminate fats, oils, and grease shall require written
approval by the Plant Superintendent, or WCSS prior to use. The use of such
additives shall in no way be considered as a substitution to the maintenance
procedures required herein.
   (h)   Chemical Treatment.  Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, acid,
or other chemical solvents designed to dissolve or remove grease shall not be
allowed to enter the grease trap.
   (i)   Sand, Soil, and Oil Interceptors.  All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, car and truck maintenance facilities, fabricators,
utility equipment shops, and other facilities (as determined by the WCSS) that
have sources of sand, soil, and oil shall install effective sand, soil and oil
traps, interceptors, and/or oil/water separators. These systems shall be sized
to effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the expected flow rates. These
systems shall be, at the user's expense, cleaned or pumped on a regular basis
to prevent impact upon the wastewater collection and treatment systems. Users
whose systems are deemed to be ineffective by the WCSS shall be asked to change
the cleaning frequency or to increase the size of the system. Owners or
operators of washing facilities will be required to prevent the inflow of
detergents and rainwater into the wastewater collection system. Oil, water
separator installations shall be required at facilities that accumulate
petroleum oils and greases and at facilities deemed necessary by the WCSS.
   (j)   Laundries.  Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an interceptor
with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that prevents
passage (into the wastewater collection system) of solids ½ inch or larger in
size such as rags, strings, buttons, or other solids detrimental to the system.
   (k)   Control Equipment.  The equipment of facilities installed to control
FOG, food waste, sand, soil, oil, and lint must be designed in accordance with
the Plumbing Code, the WV Department of Environment and Conservation
guidelines, most current engineering standards, or other applicable guidelines
approved by the WCSS. Underground equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent
inflow of rainwater and shall be easily accessible to allow regular maintenance
and inspection. Control equipment shall be maintained by the owner and/or
operator of the facility as to prevent a  stoppage of the wastewater collection
system, and the accumulation of FOG, food waste, sand, soil, oil and lint in
the collection lines, pump stations, and wastewater treatment plant. If the
Town of Eleanor is required to clean out the wastewater collection lines, as a
result of a stoppage resulting from poorly maintained control equipment (or
lack thereof) the owner or operator shall be required to refund the labor,
equipment, materials, and any overhead costs to the Town including any fines
incurred due to any sanitary sewer overflow due directly to the stoppage. The
Town retains the right to inspect and approve any and all installations of
control equipment.
   (l)   Alteration of Control Methods. The Town of Eleanor, through the WCSS,
reserves the right to request additional control measures if existing control
equipment is shown to be insufficient to protect the wastewater collection
system and wastewater treatment plant from interference due to the discharge of
FOG sand, soil, lint, or any other undesirable materials.
   (m)   Enforcement and Penalties.   Any person who violates this ordinance,
in part or whole, shall be subject to a written warning for the first
violation, a $1,000 civil penalty for the second violation, a $1,500 civil
penalty for the third violation, and a $2,000 civil penalty for the fourth
violation within a two- year period. Consistent violations will result in a
$500 increase in civil penalty and may result in termination of service.

1109.01  PURPOSES AND INTENTS.
   It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally
clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance
of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and
businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept
community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy
environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live.
Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean,
remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from
occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage
a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores,
and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article
seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and
aesthetics of properties against a person's actions or property constituting a
violation of the conditions of this article.

include areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or
otherwise described in this article.
      (35)   Start of Construction:
The date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (38)   Substantial Damage:
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to it's before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial
damage also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a 10 year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See "Substantial
Improvement."
      (39)   Substantial Improvement:
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the Start of Construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does 
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank:
The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a stream indicate
the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar with fluvial
geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional is not
employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation:
The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant with all the
requirements of this article. Any structure or other development lacking the
certifications, finished construction elevation certificate or other evidence
of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

1771.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the Town Of Eleanor which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the Town Of Eleanor by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) dated 02/02/2012 or the most recent revision thereof
including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the Town Of Eleanor by use of historic
or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local Flood
Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of
technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.  The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the Town Of Eleanor where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Anny Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   A Town Of Eleanor's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable  but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the Town Of Eleanor shall notify the NFIP Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The Town Of Eleanor may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as  flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Town Of Eleanor. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.  Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this article if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either;
         A.   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or
         B.   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
Town Of Eleanor in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then
be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of
this article.
            (Ord.  11-03.  Passed 1-5-12.)
1771.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the Town Of Eleanor during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the Town Of
Eleanor, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land
areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area as
measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the
1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway  Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Approximated Floodplain
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine;  The amount being invested and,  The
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the Town of Eleanor, The Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA ). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval..
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the Town of Eleanor in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/ or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the Town of Eleanor a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1771.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         (Ord.  11-03.  Passed 1-5-12.)

materials and labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the
estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.  All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
   (a)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation:
      (1)   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its relation
to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      (2)   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered

the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it is
highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
      (6)   A  finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared by
a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications. The
elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question, together
with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
      (7)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Town of Eleanor determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall
state:
         A.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.

penalties set forth in Section
1771.08(c).
   (b)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on dry
flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above the
Base Flood Elevation.
   (1)   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by a 
Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      (2)   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
      (3)   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA, shall
be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the plans in
(1) above, stating that the finished structure, together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
         A.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable
to  the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
   (c)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only)
      (1)   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others
of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground, proposed
finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of proposed
flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.  The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
      (2)   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
         A.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest structural
element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all utilities are
located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not  less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1771.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator, that includes the following information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
      (2)   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a 
floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood 
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study  is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision Of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord.  11-03.  Passed 1-5-12.)

2  shall be used in the portions of the structure below BFE.
         G.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         H.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (a) hereof are a
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1771.08(c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.
      (1)   Recreational vehicles to be placed within any special flood hazard
area shall either:
         A.    Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill.  The Town Of Eleanor officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1771.04(a) of this article. All fill placed in the special flood hazard area
shall meet or exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The Town of Eleanor may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Town of Eleanor During permit review the Town of
Eleanor shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or flood ways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued.  After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be
issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development.
      (1)   All structures and other development shall be constructed or placed
on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and
shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height
of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to  varying other
siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.
      (Ord. 11-03.  Passed 1-5-12.)

agent to:
         A.   Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of Putnam County to
restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not limited
to  requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the property
involved; and
         B.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in magistrate court or circuit
court.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1771.08(c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by

being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1771.08(c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1771.08(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this article or local administrative procedures, and
any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing
certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a
condition of permit approval.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the Town Of Eleanor
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the Town Of Eleanor based upon a set schedule approved by the Town
Of Eleanor using the estimated value of the proposed construction as determined
by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
Town Of Eleanor for any additional costs for services necessary for review and/
or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not limited

reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this article is started or proceeded with ptior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this article in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Ord. 11-03.  Passed 1-5-12.)
1771.08  APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals.   Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the

the right of that person to appeal to the Town Council of the Town Of Eleanor
which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be filed with the
Town Council of the Town Of Eleanor, in writing, within thirty (30) days after
notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Board
shall set a time and place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be
heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. 
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a Town Of Eleanor official that (i) the issuance of a decision to
allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such construction below the
Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications
shall be maintained with a record of all decisions; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties.  Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the Town Of Eleanor, shall
be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the Town Of Eleanor of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this article shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and
all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance with this article may be
declared by the Town Council of the Town Of Eleanor to be a public nuisance and
abatable as such.
