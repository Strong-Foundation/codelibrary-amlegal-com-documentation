§ 30.05 INDEMNIFICATION OF CERTAIN OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide authority for the Mayor
with the concurrence of Council by resolution or motion, to indemnify with city
funds or provide liability insurance for any officer, agent or employee of the
city.
      (2)   It is the intent of this section to provide indemnification and
liability insurance coverage as extensive as permitted by W.Va. Code § 8-12-7,
as amended unless otherwise restricted or limited by this section.
   (B)   Indemnification.
      (1)   The city shall indemnify all of its elected or appointed officers,
agents or employees against any and all legal liability, including, not limited
to, expenses, costs, damages, judgments, fines, settlements, court costs,
reasonable attorney fees and any other amounts actually and personally incurred
in connection with, arising from, growing out of, by reason of or in any way
connected with, any acts or omission of the city, or its officers, agents or
employees while acting within the scope of their official duties.
      (2)   Such indemnification shall extend to any officer, agent or employee
of the city who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any
proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer, agent
or employee of the city, without regard to the period of time in which such
official duties were performed, and without regard to the fact that the
performance of such official duties may have been professional in nature.
      (3)   Such indemnification shall be provided to the officers, agents or
employees of the city by the purchase of insurance as provided in division (C)
below, or by the expenditure of funds from the General Fund of the city as
provided in division (C) below.
   (C)   Insurance. The Mayor, with the concurrence of Council, shall have
plenary power and authority to contract and expend public funds for the
purchase of one of more policies of public liability insurance, which may
include professional liability insurance, providing the city and its officers,
against and employees, insurance coverage for any and all legal liability,
including, but not limited to, expenses, costs, damages, judgments, fines,
settlements, court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and any other amounts
actually and personally incurred in connection with, arising from, growing out
of, by reason of or in any way connected with, any acts or omissions of the
city, or its officers, agents or employees while acting within the scope of
their official duties.
   (D)   Expenditures from General Fund. If the insurance coverage provided
pursuant to division (C) above is deemed to exclude an act or omission of the
city or any of its officers, agents or employees, or if an insurance carrier
refuses to provide coverage for city or any of its officers, agents or
employees for any reason, expenditures from the city’s General Fund shall be
made for payment of any and all of the legal liability contemplated by division
(B) above.
   (E)   Exclusions. No indemnification shall be made under this section to any
officer, agent or employee of the city for any conversion or diversion of
public funds; any criminal act as defined by the laws of the United States, any
state, municipality or other governmental body; any criminal act which could or
does result in civil liability to any third party or the city; any act or
omission committed by such officer, agent or employee while the same was insane
or mentally incompetent; any amounts in settling or otherwise disposing of a
threatened or pending proceeding without approval of the city; any expenses
incurred in defending a threatened or pending proceeding which is settled or
otherwise disposed of without approval of the city; provided however, none of
the exclusions contained herein shall be interpreted to inure to the benefit of
any liability or other insurance carrier of the city, unless specifically
contained in the contract of insurance by between the city and such carrier.
   (F)   Indemnification by independent agencies. Any of the independent
agencies of the city, such as the Sanitary Board and the city’s Parks and
Recreation Commission, shall likewise have plenary power and authority to adopt
a resolution at a regular or special meeting called for that purpose providing
for the expenditure of the public funds of such agency to indemnify its elected
or appointed officers, agents or employees for any acts or omissions while
acting within the scope of their official duties in the manner and to the
extent provided in this section.

COMPETITIVE BIDDING
§ 30.20 WHEN REQUIRED; PUBLICATION OF NOTICE.
   (A)   Every contract for the procurement of materials, supplies, equipment,
or services by the city, except as hereinafter provided, shall be by
competitive bidding and shall not be approved and let until after at least 14
days public notice made as 1) the public posting at City Hall of the notice for
bids, request for proposal, or other written solicitation by the city, 2) the
public posting of such notice, request, or solicitation on the city’s website
and social media accounts, and 3) a Class I legal advertisement in compliance
with the provisions of W.Va. Code §§ 59-3-1 et seq., and after a public opening
for bids. Provided that the Council, or the Administrative Officer having
issued such request for competitive bidding, may reject all bids and advertise
again; further provided, that the above requirements shall not apply to any
contract for a gross amount of less than $25,000; further provided, that
purchases of materials, supplies, equipment, or services costing $25,000 or
more shall in all cases be memorialized by a contract, or other writing,
authorized by City Council prior to execution, even in the event that the above
requirements concerning competitive bidding are waived under the provisions of
division (B), below; further provided that the City Council may by motion
subsequently ratify purchases made by its employees or agents in the event of a
mistake of law or fact. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use by the
city of or be applicable to the purchasing of goods or services through the
State Director of the Purchasing Division of the State Department of Finance
and Administration as provided by the W.Va. Code § 5A-3-9.
   (B)   (1)   The provision of division (A) above, concerning competitive
bidding, shall not be applicable when the Council, by vote, finds that:
         (a)   Compliance therewith would be inimical to the public welfare;
         (b)   Procurement of the contemplated goods or services is of such
urgency as to brook no delay;
         (c)   Other circumstances exist which would render the interests of
the city better served by noncompliance than by compliance with division (A)
above;

one supplier of the goods or services sought to be obtained;
         (e)   The goods or services sought to be obtained are for the purpose
of maintenance or repair of existing city goods or equipment; or
         (f)   No suppliers of goods or services sought to be obtained are

§ 36.01 COSTS FOR COLLECTING DELINQUENT AMOUNTS DUE MUNICIPALITY.
   If any person responsible for paying or remitting any municipal tax, fee or
other charge fails to timely pay and remit amounts due the municipality, such
person shall be liable and shall pay to the municipality all reasonable costs
and amounts incurred by the municipality in collecting the delinquent amounts.

or charge. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, reasonable costs
and amounts for which a delinquent person shall be liable include, but are not
limited to, filing and recording fees, release fees, court costs, bad check
charges, postage, copy charges, court reporter charges, search costs and
similar items incurred by the municipality reasonably attributable to the
delinquency as determined by the responsible municipal official. (Alternative:
the responsible municipal official may waive collection of all or any party of
such costs for good cause shown.)
(Ord. 065, passed 10-18-2007) Penalty, see §
36.99
PUBLICATION OR DISCLOSURE OF DELINQUENT FEE INFORMATION
§ 36.15 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Treasurer of the city collects fees. It is a goal of the office of the
Treasurer to achieve the effective collection of current and delinquent fees
while providing quality customer service. This policy provides procedures for
collecting delinquent municipal fee accounts by publishing or disclosing
delinquent account information to aid in the collection of fees enacted by city
ordinance, authorized by W.Va. Code § 8-13-13 and any other operative laws of
the state.
(Ord. 066, passed 9-20-2007)
§ 36.16 PUBLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Treasurer of the city may, from time to time in his or her
discretion, prepare one or more lists of those certain service fee accounts for
the previous period(s) which are reflected as delinquent in the city’s records
and to be included for publication, which list shall be published as a Class I
legal advertisement in compliance with W.Va. Code §§ 59-3-1 et seq., and the
publication area for such publication shall be the county.
   (B)   The delinquent account information published or disclosed pursuant to
this policy may show the name of any person(s) associated with the delinquent
account, including business name and owners thereof (if applicable), address
of, and the amount or amounts due from each delinquent account in the aggregate
or by period. The published list shall display the applicable period(s) to
which the delinquency relates. The list may be presented in any sequence,
format or grouping the Treasurer may determine and may omit accounts with de
minimus delinquencies.
   (C)   The Treasurer, after ascertaining which accounts are delinquent,
shall, at least ten days prior to publication or release of a list, send notice
to the last known name and address on record with the city associated with the
account. The notice shall identify the delinquent account and/or responsible
person(s) of last record, the applicable period(s) covered, aggregate amount
due and the procedures for settling the account. Any account that is delinquent
may be removed from the delinquent list prior to publication or release by
paying the city the full amount of fees and all related costs owed by such
account before the list is delivered for publication or release.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a regular fee billing
statement showing that an account is more than 60 days overdue shall satisfy
the notice requirement of this division (C).
   (D)   The Treasurer, prior to the delivering a delinquent list to the
newspaper or otherwise releasing such list, shall review the same and be
satisfied that the list is correct.
(Ord. 066, passed 9-20-2007)
§ 36.17 EFFECT OF IRREGULARITY AS TO DELINQUENT LOANS.
   No irregularity, error, omission or mistake in respect to anything provided
by this policy to be done concerning the delinquent lists shall invalidate any
fee administered by the city. No irregularity, error, omission or mistake shall
invalidate any collection or enforcement procedures used by the city with
respect to any delinquent account. Nor shall any person be allowed to enjoin or
otherwise question the validity of any subsequent step in the collection and
enforcement procedures by reason of any irregularity, error, omission or
mistake. Any action by the Treasurer in good faith reliance on this policy
shall relieve the Treasurer and the city from any claim by any person aggrieved
by any publication or disclosure hereunder. The Treasurer may, without any
investigation or inquiry, rely upon the city’s existing and future regular
procedures and systems, including computerized collection systems, in
determining the name(s), amounts, periods and nature of purported delinquent
accounts for purposes of this policy.
(Ord. 066, passed 9-20-2007)
§ 36.18 EFFECT ON OTHER COLLECTION METHODS.
   The promulgation of this policy does not in any way limit the city from
utilizing other methods of collection, including without limitation,
administrative or judicial actions, liens, boot/tow orders, cease and desist
orders, payment plans, collection agencies and credit bureaus and all other
methods permitted by law.

collect or refrain from collecting such tax from such purchaser for such public

payment, may reduce or remit the amount of the fine or costs or the unpaid

determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the Court shall take
account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the
burden that payment of costs will impose.
   (C)   A defendant who has been sentenced to pay costs and who is not in
willful default in the payment of the costs may at any time petition the
sentencing Court for remission of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion
of the costs. If it appears to the satisfaction of the Court that payment of
the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the

of the amount due in costs, or modify the method of payment.

§ 51.49 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The water purveyor will establish, operate and promote a cross-
connection and backflow prevention control program, to include the keeping of
necessary records, which fulfills the requirements of the WVBPH Cross-
Connections and Backflow Prevention Regulations.
   (B)   The owner shall allow his or her property to be inspected for possible
cross-connections and backflow conditions, and shall follow the provisions of
the water purveyor’s program and the WVBPH Cross-Connections and Backflow
Prevention Regulations where a cross-connection is permitted.
   (C)   If the water purveyor requires that the public water system be
protected by containment, the owner shall be responsible for the installation
and maintenance of the required backflow preventer assembly(blies) and for
water quality beyond the outlet end of the containment assembly(blies) and
could utilize fixture isolation protection for that purpose, The owner may also
seek local public health officials, or personnel from the water purveyor, or
their designated representatives, or certified/licensed private sector
personnel to assist him or her in the survey of their facility(ties) and to
assist him or her in the selection of proper containment assemblies and/or
fixture isolation devices, and the proper installation of these assemblies/
devices.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)
§ 51.50 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Water purveyor.
      (1)   On new installations, the water purveyor will provide an on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer assembly(blies), if any, that will be required based on
actual or potential cross-connections and the degree of health hazards.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the water
purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises for
actual and potential cross-connections and backflow conditions and inform the
owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of
achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made.
Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed. However, this time period may be shortened
depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s)/
assembly(blies) already in place.
      (3)   The water purveyor will not allow any actual or potential cross-
connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved air gap or backflow
preventer assembly(blies) and which must be regularly tested or inspected to
ensure satisfactory operation,
      (4)   The water purveyor shall inform the owner by letter of any failure
to comply prior to a re-inspection. The water purveyor will allow an additional
15 days for the correction(s). In the event the owner fails to comply with the
necessary correction(s) by the time of a second re-inspection, the water
purveyor will inform the owner by letter, that the water service to the owner’
      (5)   If the water purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The water purveyor will conduct initial and follow-up inspections
to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. The main focus will
be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (7)   The water purveyor must report any backflow incident(s) occurring
in the public water system as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after
the incident to the WVBPH.
   (B)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all actual or potential cross-connections and/or backflow conditions on his or
her premises.
      (2)   The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the water
purveyor, shall at his or her expense, install, maintain and test, or have
tested, any and all backflow preventer assemblies on his or her premises.
      (3)   The owner shall correct within 30 days any malfunction of an air
gap or backflow preventer assembly(blies) which is revealed by periodic
inspection or testing. This may also involve the removal and/or replacement of
the backflow preventer assembly(blies).
      (4)   The owner shall inform the water purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
owner is aware, but have not been found by the water purveyor.
      (5)   The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
assembly unless there is a backflow preventer assembly of the same type on the
bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the assembly
(blies) must supply additional assemblies necessary to allow testing to take
place.
      (6)   The owner shall install only backflow preventer assemblies approved
by the water purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (7)   The owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies in a manner
approved by the water purveyor and general industry standards.
      (8)   Any owner having a private well or other auxiliary water source
must have be approval of the water purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or source
is cross-connected to the water purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-connect
may be denied. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer
assembly at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the water purveyor’s system.
      (9)   In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide portable water
for domestic purposes which is on the water purveyor’s side of a backflow
preventer assembly, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer assembly
installed.
      (10)   The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
service, permits, periodic assembly testing, retesting in the case that a
backflow preventer assembly fails to operate correctly, and follow-up re-
inspections for noncompliance with water purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
      (11)   The owner must maintain for a minimum of three years records of
installation and removal, all testing, repair and maintenance for all
assemblies/devices in the owner’s water distribution system(s).
      (12)   The owner will report any backflow incident(s) occurring in their
facility(ties)/building(s) as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after
the incident to the water purveyor and to the WVBPH. Also, the owner must
maintain for a minimum of three years all records and reports of all backflow
incidents occurring in their facility(ties)/building(s). These records and
reports are to be made available to the water purveyor and/or WVBPH upon
request.
      (13)   The city strongly recommends that the owner install vacuum
breakers on all hose-bib faucets (i.e., garden hose or outdoor faucets) that do
not have an anti-siphon unit or are not anti-siphon protected.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)
§ 51.51 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   (A)   The water purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system
arising from cross-connections and backflow conditions.
   (B)   All threats will be classified by degree of hazard which will
determine the requirements for the installation of approved backflow preventer
assemblies.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)
§ 51.52 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer assembly shall be allowed by the water
purveyor to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to
supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer assembly, or
there is an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard
has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow preventer assemblies must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure
principle assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow preventer
assembly is present.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)
§ 51.53 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (A)   Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (B)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner’s expense.
   (C)   Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the owner’s expense to ensure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than 30 days after the test date may be established. The owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts or
a replacement assembly. Parallel installation of two assemblies is an effective
means of the owner ensuring uninterrupted water service during testing or
repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the owner
desires such continuity.
   (D)   Backflow preventer assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in division (A) above in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the water purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
born by the owner.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)
§ 51.54 RECORDS.
   (A)   The water purveyor will initiate and maintain (update) the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer evaluations and/or inspections of cross-
connections and backflow conditions;
      (2)   Master files on all customer backflow preventer assemblies;
      (3)   Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs and
replacements. Records for replaced backflow preventer shall be maintained for a
period of one year after the date of removal from service;
      (4)   Records and reports of any backflow incident(s) occurring in the
public or consumer water systems shall be maintained for at least three years
after the date of the incident; and
      (5)   Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH. This material shall be maintained for at least three
years after submission.
   (B)   Upon request, the water purveyor will submit records of inspection and
noncompliance, surveys, tests results and/or corrective actions, and backflow
incident reports to the State Bureau for Public Health.
(Ord. O-27, passed 3-3-2005)

      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters; or
      (11)   Any waters or wastes having a five-day BOD greater than 300 parts
per million by weight; containing more than 350 parts per million by weight of
suspended solids; or having an average daily flow greater than 2% of the
average sewage flow of the city, shall be subject to the review of the
Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator. Where necessary in the opinion of the
Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator, the owner shall provide, at his or
her expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the
biochemical oxygen demand to 300 parts per million by weight; reduce the
suspended solids to 350 parts per million by weight; or control the quantities
and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any
other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment
facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the Wastewater
Superintendent/Chief Operator and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing.
   (E)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (D) of this section, and which in
the judgement of the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life to constitute a public
nuisance, the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator may:
         (a)   Reject the wastes;
         (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
         (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provision
of division (J) of this section.
      (2)   If the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator permits the
pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator, and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective.
   (H)   When required by the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator, the
owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes
shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters
and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained
by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling
shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a 24 hours composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all
outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial concern.

including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper, or other
industries beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of
discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste treatment.
   (B)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in division (A) of this section, the Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator
or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the company and the company shall be
held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city shall
indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city employees
and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company
to maintain safe conditions as required in §
52.05(H) of this chapter.
   (C)   The Wastewater Superintendent/Chief Operator and other duly authorized
employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of

MUNICIPAL TRAFFIC SCHOOL
§ 70.35 FINDINGS OF THE COUNCIL.
   The Council of the city hereby makes the following findings.
   (A)   There exists within the city, various problems resulting from the
improper use and operation of motor vehicles which seem to increasingly result
in the commission of offenses, sometimes popularly referred to as “moving”
violations, and all being violations of the statutes of the state and/or the
traffic ordinances of the city.
   (B)   An appropriate manner of:
      (1)   Addressing the problems associated with the improper use and
operation of motor vehicles; and
      (2)   Reducing the commission of “moving” violations by operators of
motor vehicles within the corporate limits of the city, is through additional
education of operators of motor vehicles in safe driving practices.
   (C)   An efficient, reasonable and proper manner of providing the additional
education to operators of motor vehicles would be through the city’s
establishment of a Municipal Traffic School.
   (D)   Any and all persons possessing a valid motor vehicle operator’s
license shall be deemed to be eligible for enrollment and participation in the
Municipal Traffic School.
   (E)   In certain instances, the operators of motor vehicles who are charged
with certain “moving” violations of the city’s traffic ordinances but only in
the sound discretion and with the prior and express approval of the city’s
Municipal Court Judge, may be afforded an opportunity before any formal and
final adjudication of such charged, “moving” traffic violations, to enroll in
the City’s Municipal Traffic School, and upon full and successful completion
thereof, to have one charged, but non-adjudicated “moving” traffic violation
dismissed without the transmittal by city authorities of any notice respecting
the violation to the Division of Motor Vehicles of the West Virginia Department
of Transportation; provided, that no more than one such traffic violation shall
be eligible for dismissal in the event that multiple violations are committed
within any 12-month period, all in lieu of any further judicial proceedings
thereon.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (E) above, that certain
offenses, being more particularly:
      (1)   Driving under the influence of alcohol or other controlled
substance;
      (2)   Reckless driving;
      (3)   Any school zone offense;
      (4)   Vehicular homicide; or
      (5)   Any offense involving an accident wherein any property is damaged
or any person is injured, then the enrollment in and successful completion of
the Municipal Traffic School course shall not under any circumstances result in
the dismissal of such pending traffic violation.
   (G)   Further notwithstanding the provisions of division (E) above, that any
person who either at the time of the commission of any offense which may be
subject to dismissal as a consequence of the operator’s successful completion
of the aforesaid course, or who otherwise at the time of application for
enrollment in the said course is shown according to the records maintained by
the Division of Motor Vehicles of the state’s Department of Transportation as
having then currently accrued more than six points upon the operator’s driving
records, then there shall be no dismissal of any pending traffic violation as
charged against the motor vehicle operator.
   (H)   The discretion hereby vested with the city’s Municipal Court Judge is
intended by the Council to be at all times exercised in a nonarbitrary and
nondiscriminatory manner in compliance with the statutory provisions of W.Va.
Code § 8-11-2, as amended, and in no event shall the herein vested discretion
be deemed to invalidate the provisions of this subchapter.
   (I)   Except as otherwise expressly limited or prohibited herein, the Judge
of the city’s Municipal Court may establish such other administrative
procedures, rules and/or regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of
this subchapter, which the Municipal Court Judge may deem to be necessary,
however, prior to effectuation, any such administrative procedures, rules and/
or regulations shall be reduced to written form and further shall be subject to
the approval by motion of the Council, and following the Council’s approval of
any such administrative procedures, rules and/or regulations, the same shall be

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and said terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “go”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
W.Va. Code § 17C-12-2, may proceed straight through or turn right or left
unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent
crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)   Yellow alone or “caution” when shown following the green or “go”
signal.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “stop”
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
   (C)   Red alone or “stop”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or “go” is
shown alone except as provided in divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3) below.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or “stop” signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at said intersection, except that local
authorities in their respective jurisdictions may by ordinance prohibit any
such right turn against a red or “stop” signal at any intersection within such
jurisdiction, which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at such
intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or “stop” signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into said one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at said
intersection, except that local authorities in their respective jurisdictions
may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn against a red or “stop” signal at
any intersection within such jurisdiction, which ordinance shall be effective
when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (D)   Red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (E)   Traffic-control signal located in a place other than an intersection.
In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a
place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be
applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no
application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the
pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (F)   Streetcars. The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals
as applicable to vehicles.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles.

of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

traffic-control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic-
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the

effectiveness of any official traffic-control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any highway any traffic-control device bearing thereon any
commercial advertising.

Enforcement Officer, is equal to or greater than 90°F or equal to or less than
20°F;
      (2)   In such a manner as to cause injury, strangulation or entanglement
on fences, trees or other human-made or natural obstacles;
      (3)   For a continuous period of time; or
      (4)   That is sick or injured.
   (B)   Animals may be restrained by means of a trolley system, or a tether
attached to a pulley on a cable run, if the following conditions are met.
      (1)   Only one animal may be tethered to each cable run.
      (2)   The tether must be attached to a properly fitting collar or harness
worn by the animal, with enough room between the collar and the animal's throat
through which two fingers may fit. Choke collars and pinch collars are
prohibited for purposes of tethering a dog to a cable run. There must be a
swivel on at least one end of the tether to minimize tangling of the tether
with stoppers on either side of the cable to ensure the animal is not able to
entangle himself or herself.
      (3)   The tether and cable run must be of adequate size and strength to
effectively restrain the animal. The size and weight of the tether must not be
excessive, as determined by the Enforcement Officer, considering the age, size
and health of the animal.
      (4)   The length of the tether from the cable run to the animal's collar
should allow access to the maximum available exercise area and should allow
continuous access to water and shelter. The trolley system must be of
appropriate configuration to confine the animal to the owner's property, to
prevent the tether from extending over an object or an edge that could result
in injury or strangulation, and to prevent the tether from becoming tangled
with other objects or animals. The tether must be long enough for the animal to
move around or be able to urinate or defecate in an area separate from where it
must eat, drink or lie down and allows the animal convenient access to food,
water, dry ground or shelter. No vegetation or obstacles can restrict the
movement of the animal on the tether.
   (C)   (1)   All tethered animals must have access to shelter which is
defined as any natural or artificial area which provides protection from the
direct sunlight when that sunlight is likely to cause heat exhaustion. Metal
barrels as well as any uninsulated metal structures are prohibited for use as
shelter.
      (2)   Animal shelter shall be a wind-proof and moisture-proof structure
and shall include four walls, a roof, a door flap for winter and a solid floor
raised off the ground, containing a sufficient quantity of suitable dry bedding
material.
      (3)   The containment area of any shelter shall be free of accumulated
debris so that the animal shall be free to walk or lie down without coming in
contact with any such waste or debris. A suitable method of draining shall be
provided to eliminate excess water or moisture inside the shelter.
(Ord. 316, passed 7-6-2023) Penalty, see §
90.99
§ 90.10 BARKING OR HOWLING.
   No person shall keep or harbor any dog, cat or other animal within the city
which, by frequent and habitual barking, howling, yelping, crying or squalling
creates unreasonably loud and disturbing noises of such character, intensity
and duration as to disturb the peace, quiet and good order of the city. Any
person who shall allow any dog, cat or other animal habitually to remain, be
lodged or fed within any dwelling, building, yard or enclosure which he or she
occupies or owns, shall be considered as harboring such dog, cat or other
animal. Any person in violation of this section shall, upon conviction, be
fined in accordance with §
90.99(D).

alleged infected animal, by a licensed veterinarian, to determine if the animal
is in fact infected with a potentially harmful communicable disease.
      (3)   If, upon hearing, the Judge finds that such animal is vicious,
dangerous or infected with a potentially harmful communicable disease, he or
she may order a fine or may order the animal a menace to public safety and

animal's prosecution under this section.
   (D)   Upon finding of the Judge of the Municipal Court that an animal is
vicious, dangerous or infected with a potentially harmful communicable disease,
and ordered destroyed, and if the owner or keeper of said animal appeals the
Municipal Court Judge’s ruling, said animal shall be impounded, at the cost and
expense of the animal's owner or keeper, until such appeal hearing is
concluded. If the owner or keeper of such animal fails to pay the costs and
expenses within ten days, the animal shall be deemed surrendered.

The Fire Chief shall have discretion in issuing these permits and may require

life and property.
         (b)   Before such fires are ignited, the area immediately surrounding

distance sufficient to ensure that the fire will be contained. This safety
strip shall in no event measure less than ten feet from all sides of the
material to be burned.
         (c)   Fires shall be attended at all times. The issuance of permits
does not relieve holders thereof from their responsibility to monitor wind and

otherwise permitted fires. Elkins Fire Department personnel also have the
authority to order the extinguishing of any fire, permitted or not, when in
their judgment it poses a risk to life or property.

   (F)   Any person who sets or causes to be set any fire that escaped the
safety strip and causes damage to the lands or property of another is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined an amount set forth
by Council from time to time.

§ 93.010 MATTERS INCIDENTAL TO STREET IMPROVEMENTS; CONNECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Whenever the city shall determine to permanently pave or improve any
street, 30 days before the paving shall be begun, property owners having gas,
water, sewer or other lines or conduits in the street where the paving is to be
done shall connect or have their property connected with such lines and
conduits, and where such connections have already been made, all property
owners shall have examined or examine and test the connections thoroughly, and
renew or repair them wherever such renewal or repair is deemed necessary by the
Public Works Director, and put them in good order and condition; and, at least
two feet below the surface, all the way from the mains to the inner side of the
curb line and where deemed necessary by the Public Works Director, shall fit
the pipe with the new valves, cut-offs, and the like of the weight, thickness,
diameter and style prescribed by the Public Works Director. These connections
shall be of such size and according to such regulations as are prescribed by
the Council or the Public Works Director and shall extend from the respective
lines to a point beyond the curb line.
   (B)   One such connection shall be made in front of every lot abutting on
the proposed permanent pavement or improvement and, in the business section of
the city, such connections shall be spaced more closely as directed by the
Council or Public Works Director, but such connections shall be no less than 25
feet apart. Where a permanent improvement is to be made along the side of any
corner lot, such connection shall be made as may be required by the Council or
Public Works Director upon notice. Where a permanent pavement or improvement is
to be made along vacant land not laid off into lots, the connections shall be
made at intervals of 40 feet; provided, that in such cases where the Council is
satisfied that there is no probability of the land being laid off into lots in
the future, the connections may be more distantly spaced.
(1991 Code, § 18-11)
§ 93.011 MATTERS INCIDENTAL TO STREET IMPROVEMENTS; NOTICE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS;
FAILURE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.
   Notice to property owners to make connections with gas, water, sewer or
other lines and conduits prior to the construction of permanent pavements or
improvements may be made by service of notice upon the respective property
owners or may be given by publication, in a newspaper published in the city,
for two successive weeks, designating therein the streets along which the
permanent improvements are to be made and if, after giving such notice, the
property owner fails to install such connections within 30 days after notice is
served or within 30 days after the first issue of notice appears in such
newspaper, the city may put in the necessary connections, and the expense
thereof shall be assessed against the abutting property and the owners thereof
and placed in the hands of the City Collector and Treasurer for collection, and
such expenses may be collected, with interest, as are taxes, and the costs
shall be a lien upon such abutting property; provided, that the failure of the
city to give notice in either form shall not release the property owners from
the obligation of putting in connections prior to the construction of a
permanent pavement or improvement. In no event shall any property owner be
permitted to connect with or use any connections until the cost thereof has
been paid to the city; but this last provision shall not release any property
owner from the payment of the costs thereof even if he or she does not use such
connection.
(1991 Code, § 18-12)
§ 93.012 PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS REQUESTED BY PETITION.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   All permanent improvements to streets, roads or alleys
requested by petition of persons owning property abutting such streets, roads
or alleys shall be made in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by
the city.
         (b)   Such plans and specifications shall provide for adequate grading
and drainage, including the construction of curbs and gutters in such cases as
curbs and gutters are deemed necessary to properly preserve and protect the
paving or surfacing improvements so made.
      (2)   In those cases where curbs and gutters are not deemed necessary to
properly preserve or protect the paving and surface improvements contemplated,
the city may construct said improvements, as herein provided, without curbs and
gutters, and shall thereafter maintain said improvements, pursuant to division
(C) below.
   (B)   In the event that the petition for improvements is directed only to
the paving or surfacing of the streets, roads or alleys and does not request
curbs, gutters or related improvements, and the plans and specifications for
the project require the construction of curbs, gutters or related improvements,
then the city will so advise the petitioners. If the petitioners agree that
these related improvements are necessary and are willing to pay for the same,
then petitioners will submit an amended petition requesting the city to
construct such curbs, gutters or related improvements as are necessary;
thereafter, the city will make the improvements requested by the petition or
amended petition.
   (C)   Where the permanent improvements are made by the city in accordance
with division (B) above, the city will bear the expense of resurfacing such
street, road or alley in the future when such resurfacing becomes necessary.
   (D)   In the event that the petition for surfacing or paving improvements
does not request any improvements other than the actual surfacing or paving of
any street, road or alley, and in the event that is determined by the city that
curbs, gutters or related improvements are necessary to preserve and protect
the surfacing or paving so requested and the petitioners, being so advised,
refuse to submit an amended petition as set forth in division (B) above and
decline to agree to bear the expense of such improvements, then the city will
proceed to make the improvements only as requested by the petition.
   (E)   Where improvements are made in accordance with division (D) above, the
city shall not bear the expense of resurfacing or repaving the street, road or
alley so improved at such time as such resurfacing or repaving might become
necessary.
   (F)   Any of the foregoing provisions notwithstanding, the city will
continue to perform ordinary and routine maintenance of all streets, roads and
alleys within the city.
   (G)   This section applies only to petitions for the surfacing or paving of
those streets, roads or alleys which heretofore have not been permanently
improved by surfacing or paving with asphalt or concrete.

CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS
§ 93.025 OBLIGATION OF OWNER; EXCEPTION.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of all persons owning land or lots which front
upon a street which is maintained and kept by the city to put down and keep in
good repair a suitable sidewalk or footwalk along the entire part of such land
or lot which fronts upon any such street.
   (B)   When, in the opinion of the Council, it has become necessary, the
property owner shall repave the sidewalk, in such a manner, of such width and
of such suitable material as the Council shall direct; provided, that before
any permanent sidewalk or footwalk is laid, it shall be the duty of the Public
Works Director to fix the grade thereof, and such sidewalk shall be laid in
conformity to such grade; and should the city, after the walk is laid, change
the grade, the cost of laying a new walk to conform to such changed grade shall
be paid by the city, as well as all damages the owner of the land or lot may
sustain by reason of such change of grade.
   (C)   The Public Works Director, after establishing of the grade of any such
walk shall report to the Council at the next regular meeting or sooner, if the
Council shall so require, what is necessary for the protection and preservation
of such walks to be laid in pursuance of this subchapter; and the Council,
having made such provision for the protection and preservation of the walks as
it deems necessary and proper, may thereupon direct that such walks be laid.
(1991 Code, § 18-13) (Ord. 097-03, passed 3-26-1997)

   Assessments by city to improve streets and sidewalks, see W.Va. Code §§ 8-
18-1 et seq.
   Low cost street and sidewalk improvements, see W.Va. Code §§ 8-17-1 et seq.
§ 93.026 OBLIGATION OF OWNER; FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   (A)   Notice; authority of city. If at any time any sidewalk or footwalk
needs repair, or if any land or lot owner fails to build such walk or repave
any walk when repaving, in the opinion of the Council, has become necessary, it
shall be the duty of the Mayor to cause the owner of the land or lot adjacent
thereto to be notified in writing of such need of laying or repair of the walk
and of the character of repaving needed to be done and, if such repairs are not
made by the land or lot owner within ten days after the service of such notice
or if such new walk is not laid or repaving done within 30 days after the
service of such notice, the Council shall then have the power and authority to
repair or repave any such sidewalk or footwalk.
   (B)   Alternate arrangements. The Council shall have the authority and it
shall be within it sole discretion whether to repair or repave such walk by
force account or by contract.
      (1)   Force account. If the Council elects to repair or repave the walk
by force account, it shall keep an accurate account of the labor and materials
used in making such repairs or repavement, which statement of costs shall be
filed in the office of the City Clerk.
      (2)   Contract. If the Council determines to repair or repave by
contract, the Council shall advertise for bids by publication in one of the
newspapers of the city once a week for not more than two weeks, and all
contracts let in pursuant of such advertisement shall be to the lowest
responsible bidder; but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the
Council rejecting any and all bids made in pursuant of such advertisement.
   (C)   Costs. After any sidewalk is repaired, constructed or repaved in
pursuance of the power herein granted, the cost thereof shall be paid out of
the city treasury in the first instance and the Council, after allowing such
costs, shall lay an assessment against the lot benefitted thereby, with a
penalty of an amount set forth by Council from time to time added, and this
assessment shall be placed in the hands of the City Collector and Treasurer, to
be collected by him or her from such land or lot owner as city taxes are
collected; and the cost of such work shall be a lien against such land or lot
abutting on such walkway, taking priority over all other liens, except taxes,
and shall be enforced as city taxes and assessments are enforced against real
estate, or by other appropriate procedure.
   (D)   Fines. If the owner of any such land or lot, after having been given
notice by the Mayor, as herein provided, to lay, repave or repair said sidewalk
shall fail to do so within the time as herein provided, the Mayor may cause any
such land or lot owner to be summoned before the Municipal Court Judge to show
cause why a fine should not be imposed for such failure to repair, repave or
construct the sidewalk as herein provided.
   (E)   Service of notices to nonresidents. If the owner of any such land or
lot is not a resident of the city, the notice to him or her required by this
regulation may be served upon him or her as notices are served under the laws
of this state.
(1991 Code, § 18-14) Penalty, see §
93.999
§ 93.027 LIABILITY OF ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to relieve the adjacent
property owner from liability for personal injury or property damage sustained
by any person on account of any sidewalk becoming out of repair, and it shall
be the duty of the property owner to keep the sidewalk adjacent to his or her
property repaired, in good order, free and clean and, in case any damage is
sustained by the city or recovered against it on account of such sidewalk not
being kept repaired, in good order, free and clean, the damages, including
costs and expenses, shall be recoverable by the city from the adjacent property
and the owner thereof. In case any suit is brought against the city by any
person on account of any sidewalk being out of repair, it shall be the duty of
the Mayor to notify the owner of the property adjacent to the sidewalk where
the accident on which such suit is based is alleged to have occurred, and such
property owner shall have the right to employ counsel and to come in and defend
the suit if he or she so desires; provided, that the provision for the giving
out of notice by the Mayor is only directory, and shall not preclude the right
of the city to recover as aforesaid from the property owner, although such
notice is not given.
(1991 Code, § 18-15)
§ 93.028 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   No permanent sidewalk or footwalk shall be constructed within the city by
any person unless it conforms to the specifications therefor on file in the
office of the Mayor of the city; provided, that under special circumstances the
Council may, by an order entered of record, specify any change or variation
from such specifications. All permanent sidewalks or footwalks built by the
city, where the owners have failed to construct them, shall be built in
accordance with those specifications; but if any variation is made in the
construction of such sidewalks by the city, such variation shall not deprive
the city of its right to recover the cost of the construction of the sidewalk,
and such variation in the specifications shall be deemed to have been made
under the authority of the Council if the sidewalks, after being so
constructed, are accepted from the contractor by the Council.
(1991 Code, § 18-16)

§ 110.085 ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS CONCERNING CONTRACTING.
   (A)   Without limiting the generality of the administrative and collection
powers granted to the Treasurer in this subchapter, the Treasurer is also
empowered to require any person engaging or continuing within the municipality
in the business of contracting to furnish a list of the names, addresses and
amounts paid by them to any subcontractors employed and suppliers of materials
used upon any job or to do any work within the municipality. The Treasurer may
also require every person engaging or continuing within the municipality in the
business of contracting who is a nonresident of the state to pay or guarantee
the payment of the amount of the tax imposed by this subchapter for the
privilege of engaging in the business of contracting within the municipality,
such payment of such tax to be based upon the amount of the building permit
issued by the municipality for the work to be performed by such person, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of such building permit. In lieu of such
prior payment in cash of such tax, any such nonresident may guarantee the
payment of such privilege tax provided for herein by delivering to the
municipality a bond, with good and adequate surety, payable to the
municipality, and conditioned to pay such tax on or before the estimated date
of the completion of the work to be performed by such person within the
municipality.
   (B)   Any person engaging a contractor or subcontractor within this
municipality shall withhold payment in sufficient amount to cover taxes
assessed by this subchapter in the final settlement of such contracts until the
receipt of a certificate from the Treasurer to the effect that all taxes levied
and accrued under this subchapter against the contractor have been paid. If any
person fails to withhold as provided herein and the contractor or subcontractor
fails to timely pay such tax, such person shall be personally liable for the
payment of such taxes, and the same shall be recoverable by the Treasurer by
appropriate legal proceedings.

§ 110.086 CLAIMS FOR REFUND OR CREDIT.
   (A)   Any taxpayer claiming to have overpaid any tax, interest or penalty
imposed by this subchapter shall file its claim with the Treasurer within three
years after the due date of the return in respect of which the tax was imposed,
and not thereafter.
   (B)   If, as a result of the claim, the Treasurer shall be of the opinion
that the tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, was overpaid, the
Treasurer shall refund the same to the taxpayer. If the Treasurer denies the
claim, the taxpayer may within 30 days after notice of denial file with the
Treasurer a petition for refund or credit, which shall be heard in accordance
with §
110.079. A taxpayer’s failure to abide by express procedures contained in this
section precludes taxpayer’s right to any refund or credit of tax, interest and
penalties paid or collected under this subchapter.

   (B)   If any person fails to make the return or any quarterly installment
required by this subchapter, or makes its return but fails to remit, in whole
or in part, the proper amount of tax, there shall be added to the amount of tax
unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of 5% of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency, and
1% of the tax for each succeeding month, or fraction thereof of delinquency;
provided, that if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the Treasurer may
waive, in whole or in part, these penalties. Additionally, if the failure to
pay is due to fraud or intent to evade any such tax there shall be added an
additional penalty of 25% of the tax owed, exclusive of penalties. Interest and
penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax imposed by this
subchapter.

chapter fifty-nine of this code, on the city’s website or in such other
reasonable manner as determined by the city to provide notice of the
delinquency without incurring unnecessary costs related to the publication.

shall be given 30-day written notice that his or her name is on the list to be
published unless the delinquent taxes are paid prior to the date upon which the

      (3)   To cover the costs of preparing, publishing and posting a

      (1)   Class A. In the case of a Class A retail dealer, the license fee
shall be an amount set forth by Council from time to time for each place of
business; the license fee for social, fraternal or private clubs not operating
for profit and having been in continuous operation for two years or more
immediately preceding the date of application, shall be an amount set forth by
Council from time to time; except, that railroads operating in the city may
dispense nonintoxicating beer upon payment of an annual license tax of an
amount set forth by Council from time to time for each dining, club or buffet
car in which such beverage is dispensed. Class A licenses issued for social,
fraternal or private clubs and for railroad dining, club or buffet cars, as
herein provided, shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at
retail, for consumption only on the licensed premises where sold. All other
Class A licenses shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at
retail, for consumption on or off the licensed premises.
      (2)   Class B. In the case of a Class B retailer, there shall be two
types of Class B license. The fee for a Class B license authorizing the sale of
unchilled beer only shall be an amount set forth by Council from time to time.
The fee for a Class B license authorizing the sale of both chilled and
unchilled beer shall be an amount set forth by Council from time to time. A
Class B license shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at
retail in bottles, cans or other sealed containers only, and only for
consumption off the licensed premises. Sales under this license, to any person
at any one time, must be in lesser quantities than five gallons. Such license
may be issued only to the proprietor or owner of a grocery store. For the
purposes of this subchapter the term GROCERY STORE means and includes any
retail establishment commonly known as a grocery store or delicatessen, where
food or food products are sold for consumption off the premises.
   (B)   In the case of a distributor, the license fee shall be an amount set
forth by Council from time to time; for each place of business.
   (C)   In the case of a brewery with its principal place of business located
in the city, the license fee shall be an amount set forth by Council from time
to time for each place of manufacture.

the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this subchapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protect by the
First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the distribution

   (F)   Nonpayment of fines. All fines imposed by citations under this section

shall constitute a failure to appear or otherwise respond under W.Va. Code § 8-

notice of violation for a violation contained in division (A)(3) above, whether

days of service of such citation, file a petition for appeal of the citation,
along with the required bond, with the Municipal Court Clerk in accordance with
the following.
         (a)   In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation,
within ten days of service of the citation, the recipient of the citation shall

Clerk, which amount will be held by the Municipal Court as bond pending hearing
and resolution of the case by the Municipal Court and the Municipal Court Clerk
shall issue a receipt to the recipient of the citation showing the amount of
the bond paid. In addition to the bond, the recipient of the citation shall
file with the Municipal Court Clerk a petition for appeal of the citation. If
any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely
filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the recipient of the
citation shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the
citation, and such petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed;
provided, however, that nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the
Municipal Court Judge from finding, upon a proper application and showing, that
the recipient of the citation suffers from financial hardship, and, as a
result, waiving the requirement that the bond be posted.
         (b)   Any petition for appeal filed with the Municipal Court Clerk
must be in writing, on the form to be provided by the Municipal Court Clerk,
and must be signed by the recipient of the citation affirming that the contents
of the petition are true and accurate to the best of the recipient of the
citation’s knowledge at that time. Such petition for appeal shall state the
facts and reasons in support of the petition. Upon filing any such petition for
appeal with the Municipal Court Clerk, the recipient of the citation shall
serve a copy of the petition and receipt showing proof of bond, or application
for waiver thereof, upon the City Attorney.
      (2)   Upon filing of a petition for appeal with the Municipal Court
Clerk, the Clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the Municipal
Court docket, set the case for hearing within 30 days from the date of the
filing of the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the recipient
of the citation, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement official
who issued the citation. Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement official
shall cause a copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the Municipal
Court Clerk who shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation
indicated therein.
      (3)   (a)   The Municipal Court shall treat the citation itself as the
original complaint before the court.
         (b)   At the close of all of the evidence presented at the hearing on
the petition for appeal, should the Municipal Judge find against the recipient
of the citation, the bond posted by the recipient of the citation shall be
applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation.
         (c)   In the event the Municipal Court Judge finds that the recipient
of the citation suffers from financial hardship, the Municipal Court Judge may
permit alternative sentencing.
         (d)   Should the court find in favor of the recipient of the citation,
the bond, if applicable, shall be refunded to the recipient of the citation by
the Municipal Court Clerk, and the citation shall be dismissed.

VACANT STRUCTURES
§ 150.150 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the city.
(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.151 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (B)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the city, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (C)   This subchapter ensures that, through a registration, inspection and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather-tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings and will not present otherwise a
public hazard.
   (D)   The city, by and through its departments, shall inspect and monitor
vacant buildings, shall assess the effects of the condition of those buildings
on nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate and
develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (E)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing
procedure (that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders,
fines, liens, appeals and due process lien enforcement), by placing the
responsibility to register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner
before a building’s condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a
complaint.
(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.152 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BOARDED. A building or structure subject to the provision of this section
shall be deemed to be BOARDED if in place of one or more exterior doors, other
than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a sheet or sheets of
plywood or similar material covering the space for such door or window.
      EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE AND MAJOR SYSTEMS. The safe and lawful maintenance
of the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior of the
building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the roof, the
electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer system, and
the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable and as enforced
by the Code Enforcement Officer, particularly in connection with codes adopted
by the city as well as all applicable local, state and federal laws.
      OCCUPIED. Any building or structure shall be deemed to be OCCUPIED if one
or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or any
part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or
equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis,
or any combination of the same. For purposes of this section, evidence offered
to prove that a building is so OCCUPIED may include, but shall not be limited
to: the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid city business license, or the most recent, federal, state or
city income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official
business or residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or
proof of bona fide pre-rental inspection.
      OPEN. A building or structure subject to the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to be OPEN if any one or more exterior doors other than a storm
door is broken, open and/or closed but, without a properly functioning lock to
secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not capable of being locked
and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the same.
      OWNER. An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser estate
therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents, receiver,
executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or corporation that
is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to the provisions of
this subchapter, and as set forth herein.
      VACANT. A building or structure shall be deemed to be VACANT if no person
or persons actually, currently conducts a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully resides, dwells or lives in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed
VACANT and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the Building Codes or Health and Sanitation Codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service and the like. CONTINUED is meant to
be without more than one 30-day interruption in any given 360-day period. In
order for such continual utility service to be considered as being actually in
use as described in this section, it must be more than merely registered to the
owner for purposes of billing and must be utilized, at a minimum, in order to
keep the property and the major systems of the building in compliance with
Building and Safety Codes. The person or entity asserting that there has been
continued utility service has the burden to produce actual bills evidencing
utility service for the relevant period.
   (B)   Criteria. All vacant structures shall also comply with the following
criteria.
      (1)   Exterior property areas are to be mowed regularly and non-
cultivated gardens maintained at no more than 17 inches of growth. All noxious
weeds are prohibited.
      (2)   Structure is to be broom swept and cleared of all contents, not
including building materials or components to be used in the future renovation
at that structure.
      (3)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed. Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
      (4)   Using wood sheet goods, all loose, deteriorated and broken windows
and doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to
prevent the unwanted entry of trespassers. Such wood sheet goods are to be cut
and neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening.
      (5)   All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions
(masonry or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
      (6)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the
owner to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above
items.
      (7)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   The requirements of this section shall be applicable to each owner
of any building that is found to be vacant pursuant to the language contained
herein. Each such owner shall cause to be filed a notarized registration
statement, which shall include the street address and parcel number of each
such vacant building, the names and addresses of all owners, as hereinafter
described, and any other information deemed necessary by the Code Enforcement
Officer. The registration fee(s) as required by this section shall be billed by
the city and shall be paid by last day of the month when the property has been
registered.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the following shall also be
applicable:
         (a)   If the owner is a corporation, the registration statement shall
provide the names and residence addresses of all officers and directors of the

(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.153 INSPECTION.
   At the time of registration, the Building Inspector, Code Enforcement
Officer, Fire Chief and Police Chief shall determine whether it is necessary
for any or all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any public
safety issues needing addressed. Inspections shall also be available to verify
the status of any property concerning occupancy, vacancy and the like. If an
internal inspection is deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same
and arrangements made for the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent to
and arrange for an inspection, the city will seek an administrative search
warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include the
Municipal Court, to authorize inspection of the premises for the purpose of
determining the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to
ensure its structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by
firefighters and police officers in time of emergency, and that the build in
and its contents do not present a hazard to the public during the time that the
building remains vacant.
(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.154 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for Life, Safety and Building Code matters by city officials,
the applicable code provisions or regulations, and will be afforded a
reasonable time to the corrective action. Corrective action concerning the
occupancy of vacant structures is discussed later herein.
(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.155 REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   (A)   Generally. At the time of adoption of this subchapter, all owners of
realty within the city that contain a vacant structure, as defined above, shall
register the same with the office of code enforcement of the city. For those
structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of this
subchapter, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure with
the code enforcement office within 30 days after the structure is found to meet
the definition of a vacant structure. The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the Code Enforcement
Officer, Building Inspector, Fire Chief and Police Chief of the city, so as to
ensure that the purpose of this subchapter is met. Specifically, the above-
named city officers shall have the authority to require that the property owner
provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer and the like) to determine
the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to ensure its
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by firefighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time the building remains vacant.
The above- named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to the owner
for corrective action deemed necessary. The Building Inspector and Fire Chief
shall rely upon the State Building Code and Fire Code, as well as other
applicable law, for guidance during any such structural review.
   (B)   Registration statement and fees; local agent.
      (1)   If none of the persons listed, as above, is shown at an address
within the state, the registration statement also shall provide the name and
address of a person who resides within the state and who is authorized to
accept service of process on behalf of the owners and who shall be designated
as a responsible, local party or agent, both for purposes of notification in
the event of an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare and
for purposes of service of any and all notices or registration statements as
herein authorized and in connection herewith. Registration shall be required
for all vacant buildings, whether vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant
and boarded, and shall be required whenever any building has remained vacant
for 45 consecutive days or more. In no instance shall the registration of a
vacant building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate
the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other Building
Code or Housing Code requirement. One registration statement may be filed to
include all vacant buildings of the owner so registering, but each structure
constitutes a separate fee. The owner of the vacant property as of the last day
of the month when the property has been registered of each calendar year shall
be responsible for the payment of the non-refundable registration fee.
      (2)   Said fee shall be billed by the city; and based on the duration of
the vacancy as determined by the following scale:
         (a)   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
         (b)   Two hundred dollars for properties that are vacant for at least
one year but less than two years;
         (c)   Four hundred dollars for properties that are vacant for at least
two years but less than three years;
         (d)   Six hundred dollars for properties that are vacant for at least
three years but less than four years;
         (e)   Eight hundred dollars for properties that are vacant for at
least four years but less than five years; and
         (f)   One thousand six hundred dollars for properties that are vacant
for at least five years, plus an additional $300 for each year in excess of
five years.
   (C)   Failure to register. If the owner fails to register the building, the
Code Enforcement Officer may register the building as herein. Upon registration
by the Code Enforcement Officer, the owner shall be notified of the
registration and billed by the city, if applicable and at the appropriate rate.
(Ord. 131, passed 9-1-2011; Ord. 213, passed 6-16-2016)
§ 150.156 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (A)   Appeal rights. The owner shall have the right to appeal the imposition
of the registration fees to the Code Enforcement Officer upon filing an
application in writing to that Department no later than 15 calendar days after
the date of the billing statement. On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden
of providing satisfactory objective proof of occupancy as defined in this
subchapter specifically.
   (B)   One-time waiver of registration fee. A one-time waiver of the
registration fee, or an extension of a waiver for up to 90 days from the date
of the current billing statement, may be granted by the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee upon application of the owner and upon review
and advice of the Building Inspector; if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee that he or she is in the process of demolition,
rehabilitation or other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the Code Enforcement Officer or his or
her designee a reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition,
rehabilitation or other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the Code Enforcement Officer or his
or her designee that he or she was actively attempting to sell or lease the
property during the vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the Code Enforcement Officer, to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and documentable as necessary.
   (C)   Within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the waiver
application is received, the Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee
shall grant or deny the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and
dispatch the written decision by mail to the owner. If the owner properly
submitted an application for a one-time waiver or request for extension to the
Code Enforcement Officer or his or her designee, and the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee rendered a decision which the owner seeks to
appeal to the Council, the owner must file an application in writing no later
than 30 calendar days from the date of the Code Enforcement Officer or his or
her designee’s decision. Council shall either grant or deny the appeal.
Thereafter, the decision of Council is final unless within 30 days of such
decision the owner appeals for injunctive relief to the Circuit Court of the
county.

§ 150.157 AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (A)   Duty to amend registration statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same to
contact the Department of Licenses and Inspections with 30 days of the
occurrence of such change and advise the Department in writing of those
changes.

§ 150.159 NONPAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.
   (A)   Delinquent registration fees as a lien. After the owner is given
notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those owners that
have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to §
150.156, and the owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the city and the city may commence a civil
action to collect such unpaid debt.
   (B)   Lien or liens, as used in this section, shall arise whenever the fees
and charges as described in this section are levied or imposed.
   (C)   If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the city
begins the collection action to enforce its lien, then the Code Enforcement
Officer shall post the written notice on the property and send the written
notice to the owner(s) by certified and regular mail.
   (D)   (1)   The city may take action to sell the subject property by means
of forfeiture and the court ordered enforcement process to collect the debt
owed the city. Should the city take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the city shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due.
      (2)   Purchasers of the subject property shall be similarly responsible
for registration pursuant to this section in the same manner as the prior owner
and must begin the registration process anew if said property remains vacant.

conspicuously posting and attaching a copy of the notice to the subject
property, and by serving the notice on the owner or landowner in the same
manner as service of a complaint as set forth in §
150.183.

addition to any other bond required or authorized by the West Virginia Rules of
Civil Procedure or other applicable law.
   (D)   At the conclusion of a hearing held under this division (D), if the
court finds that the structure, dwelling or building is unsafe, unsanitary,
dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare, the court shall make

of record in the office of the County Assessor and to any other address for the
landowner as may exist on record with the city. If, for any reason, such

property.
(Ord. 254, passed 6-7-2018)
§ 150.183 NOTICES.
   (A)   To the extent not otherwise authorized by state law, all notices of
violation or correction for violations that do not fall within one of the
categories set forth in §
150.179(A)(1)(a) or (A)(1)(b) shall be served in accordance with the process
set forth in the State Building Code.
   (B)   (1)   Any violation of this subchapter may be prosecuted by the
municipality consistent with state and local laws. Unless otherwise authorized
by state law, prosecution of a violation shall be initiated by a complaint
presented to and sworn or affirmed before a Municipal Judge or other municipal
official with lawful authority to hear and determine violations of municipal
code in the municipality where the offense is alleged to have occurred. Unless
otherwise provided by statute, the presentation and oath or affirmation shall
be made by a Code Enforcement Agency Official or City Attorney showing reason
to have reliable information and belief. If from the facts stated in the
complaint the Municipal Judge or other municipal official with lawful authority
to hear and determine violations of municipal code finds probable cause, the
complaint becomes the charging instrument initiating a criminal proceeding. A
complaint lawfully authorized by this division (B) along with a summons setting
forth the date, time and place of appearance before a Municipal Judge and or
other municipal official with lawful authority to hear and determine violations
of municipal code shall be served in accordance with the law of the state
concerning the service of process in civil actions, except that personal
service of a summons and complaint may be made by a Code Enforcement Agency
Official.
      (2)   (a)   If service is made by certified mail under Rule 4(d)(1)(D) of
the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and delivery of the summons and
complaint is refused, the Code Enforcement Agency Official, promptly upon the
receipt of the notice of the refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being
noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and
complaint.
         (b)   If the first class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by
the U.S. Postal Service, service of the summons and complaint is presumed to
have been effectuated. Upon service of the summons and complaint consistent
with this division (B), the violation may be prosecuted consistent with state
and local law.

unnecessary hardship upon the person making the appeal. The Board may grant a
variance, provided the following findings are made, where relevant, in a given
instance:
         (a)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the city’s Building Code;
         (b)   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the city’s Building Code and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
         (c)   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the party
making the appeal;
         (d)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district wherein the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; or
         (e)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
which will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation at issue.
      (2)   Granting of variance. In granting any variance, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of the City Building Code.
      (3)   Special exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide requests for
all special exceptions as provided in this subchapter and in accordance with
such standards and criteria contained in this subchapter. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in
addition to those expressed in this subchapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes and intent of the City Building Code.

following the entering of the final decision of the Board of Appeals.

the occupancy of a building or structure or portion thereof or of the premises,

be affected by flooding.
   ADVERSELY AFFECT ADJACENT PROPERTIES. To adversely affect a property the
increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation must be more
than one foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect is that the 100-
year flood base flood elevation rises one foot or less the property is not
affected. This standard does not apply to the floodway. If prior permit(s) has/
have been approved in the same area of the floodplain, the above definition
would include the cumulative impact to the base flood elevation.
   APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. A structure on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and the use of which is incidental and used for storage
only to the use of the principal structure. This does not include a gas or
liquid storage tank. These structures cannot be used as living space.

in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base flood in
relation to the datum specified on the county’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Forthe purposes of this chapter, the 100-year flood or 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. (See also 100-YEAR FLOOD.)
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE. A certification that the entire development,
including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure is in
compliance with all the provisions of this chapter.
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to balance the loss
of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures are placed within
the special flood hazard area.
   CONTRACTOR. W.Va. Code § 21-11-3(c).
      (1)   A person who in any capacity for compensation, other than as an
employee of another, undertakes, offers to undertake, purports to have the
capacity to undertake, or submits a bid to construct, alter, repair, add to,

first significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant
with all requirements of this chapter. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such
time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or developments
can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the development is to
bring the structure into compliance with the current ordinance.

UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
§ 151.030 FLOODWAY.
   (A)   Within any Floodway Area (Fl), no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study shall
include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional,
providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies,
analyses, computations, and the like, shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.

due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable federal and state law, ordinances and
regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the city,
be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area as measured
from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 1% annual
chance special flood hazard area boundary.
(Ord. 280, passed 3-4-2021) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.031 AE ZONE WITHOUT FLOODWAY AREA.
   Within any AE Zone Without Floodway Area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one foot at any point.
(Ord. 280, passed 3-4-2021) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.032 APPROXIMATED FLOODPLAIN (ZONE A).
   Within any Approximated Floodplain Area:
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from federal, state, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
   (B)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all proposed
development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the specific
flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the
applicant to determine the elevation above which the development and adjacent
properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be reasonably
safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other techniques.
When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be
prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable federal and state laws, ordinances and regulations.
   (D)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway Area,
no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of
the 100-year flood more than one foot at any point.
(Ord. 280, passed 3-4-2021) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.033 ALTERATION OR RELOCATION OF A STREAM.
   (A)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within the
special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified
mail, the city Floodplain Administrator, the state Coordinating Office, any
adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which federal or state law requires approval.
   (B)   The developer shall also assure the city in writing that the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain best practice techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
   (D)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream crossings
shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this chapter.
   (E)   The developer is required to provide the city of a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
151.999.
   (F)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.

provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the non-
conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
150.999.
(Ord. 280, passed 3-4-2021)
§ 151.043 SITE PLAN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (B)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site
plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten lots or two acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall
delineate the floodway.
         (a)   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the base flood
elevation.
         (b)   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local Water Resource Department.
         (c)   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (C)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
base flood elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two or five
feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed and
the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA map.
A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or others of
demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.

and utilities, elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the base
flood elevation.
      (3)   Openings. For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding, shall be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant on all
flood proofed structures and any elevated structures when the Floodplain
Administrator determines that the area below the first floor could be converted
to a non-conforming use (generally applies to the enclosed areas below base
flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement shall state:
         (a)   The area below the base flood elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this chapter.
         (b)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of

adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10A and 10B as
authorized by W.Va. Code §§ 21-9-1 et seq. The anchoring shall be adequate to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties, attached to
permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate to satisfy
flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         (d)   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer

installing the unit shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that
the manufactured home has been installed to the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (C)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   When possible, appurtenant structures shall be located out of the
special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the base flood elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         (a)   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size and
valued at less than $7,000.
            2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation.
            6.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the base flood elevation.
            7.   Opening requirements. Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls are equalized by allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
               A.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   In addition, a non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this chapter. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the non-
conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the non-conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in §
150.999.
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
chapter.
   (E)   Fill.
      (1)   The city officially recognizes the beneficial functions the
floodplain area serves in storage and transportation of water during floods.
Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged and should be
minimized.
      (2)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (3)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not
result in any increase in the base flood elevation.
      (4)   All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         (a)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, and the like, shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   A fill site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
chapter and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required in division (E)(4)(e) below. For non-residential structures,
fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         (e)   At grade access, with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a
nonresidential structure.
         (f)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         (g)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         (h)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (i)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to floodwaters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to floodwaters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         (j)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance/occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, “Overview &
Concurrence Form” or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         (k)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow;
and
      (2)   Insofar as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code § 22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this division (H) at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the flood
protection setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the flood protection setback area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below base flood elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other state environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this chapter, material that resembles fill material
shall not be considered storage material for purposes of this division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH and
AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area floodplain area.

and filed in the official floodplain permit application file by the City Clerk
is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator after a showing by the
applicant of “justifiable delay” not caused by the negligence or lack of due
diligence of the applicant. Any extension of the 180-day start of construction
timeframe shall only be granted if the permit holder can demonstrate compliance

whether a violation actually occurred and/or abatement of the alleged
violation, whichever occurs first.
      (4)   In the event of an appeal on a floodplain permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall immediately issue a stop work order notice that shall
remain in effect until a resolution of said appeal.
   (B)   Inspections and revocations.

information provided on the floodplain permit application, this chapter and
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances.
      (2)   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the floodplain permit application, this chapter or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a “stop work order
notice”, revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of Randolph County. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-floodplain law, regulation or ordinance.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized county, state or
federal government officials may inspect any development covered by this
chapter or previous floodplain ordinances to determine whether any portion of

151.999
§ 151.068 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in §
151.999.
   (B)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the utility
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development being
inspected conforms to the requirements of this chapter. Inspection and approval
of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in §
151.999.
   (C)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this chapter. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in §
151.999.
   (D)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.

development. This shall be a flat fee approved by Common Council.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this chapter shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the city based upon a set schedule approved by Council using the
estimated value of the proposed construction as determined by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
city for any additional costs for services necessary for review and/or
inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not limited to,
professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain Administrator may
require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional costs may include
reimbursement for contracted services.
   (B)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this chapter is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the city for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this chapter in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the city may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application
of the requirements.
   (B)   Considerations for the issuance of variances to this chapter shall
adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances;
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the special
flood hazard area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance;
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the base flood elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this chapter; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management

floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any floodway area that would cause any increase in the base flood elevation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the zoning ordinance of the City of Elkins,
West Virginia, hereinafter referred to as “this code” or “this chapter.”
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.002 AUTHORITY.
   Whereas, by act of the West Virginia State Legislature, as recorded in West
Virginia Code, the governing body of any county or municipality may, by
ordinance, classify the territory under its jurisdiction into districts of such
number, shape, and size as it may deem best suited to carry out the purpose of
zoning.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.003 PURPOSE.
   This code is consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan and was developed
to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. Other
purposes of this code include:
   (A)   To plan so that adequate light, air, convenience of access, and safety
from fire, flood, and other danger is secured;
   (B)   To ensure attractiveness and convenience is promoted;
   (C)   To lessen congestion;
   (D)   To preserve historic landmarks, sites, districts, and buildings;
   (E)   To promote the orderly development of land; and
   (F)   To preserve agriculture.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.004 SCOPE; JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, addition,
alteration, moving, repair, and use of any building, structure, parcel of land,
or sign within the city, except work located primarily on a public way or road,
or on public utility towers and poles, and public utilities, unless
specifically mentioned in this code.
   (B)   In fulfilling these purposes, this code is intended to benefit the
public as a whole and not any specific person or class of persons. Although,
through the implementation, administration, and enforcement of this code,
benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals,
such is merely a byproduct of the overall benefit to the whole community.
Therefore, unintentional breaches of the obligations of administration and
enforcement imposed on the city hereby shall not be enforceable in tort.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.005 INTERPRETATION; CONFLICT; SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, these regulations shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or
annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provisions of
law. Where the conditions imposed by, or pursuant to, these regulations are
different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any
other ordinance rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, the
provisions which are more restrictive, and which impose the higher or greater
standards shall control. If any portion of this code held invalid for any
reason, the remaining herein shall not be affected.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.006 NON-EXCLUSIONARY INTENT.
   It is not the intent of this code to exclude any persons or groups with
differing economic, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or
familial status from enjoyment of a residence, land ownership, or tenancy
within the city; nor is it the intent of this code to use public powers in any
way to promote the separation within the city of economic, racial, religious,
or ethnic groups, except as may be an incidental result of meeting the purposes
outlined in this subchapter.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.007 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The zoning ordinance of the city shall include this code and the
accompanying official zoning map, which shall be considered part of this code.
The official zoning map shall be the map certified by the City Council. All
subsequent amendments (i.e., rezoning) of the official zoning map shall be
certified by the City Council and then filed with both the office of the Clerk
of Randolph County and the City Clerk.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.008 ENACTMENT.
   The Council of the City of Elkins hereby ordains for the purpose of
accomplishing the objectives set out in the West Virginia Code, and §
152.003 above, that the following be enacted as the zoning code of the city.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.009 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall take effect upon final adoption.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
ADMINISTRATION; ENFORCEMENT; AMENDMENTS
§ 152.020 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that the processes by which the
zoning ordinance is effectuated have been clearly identified and delineated.
This subchapter shall outline the duties and powers of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the zoning permit process, the appeals process, and other enforcement
related provisions.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.021 POWERS AND DUTIES OF ZONING OFFICER.
   Council shall appoint a Zoning Officer, who shall have the authority to
administer and enforce this code. Duties of the Zoning Officer include but are

issued with notations as to special conditions. All records shall be open for
public inspection.
   (B)   Review permit applications and notifications as necessary to determine
compliance with the provisions of this code. No permit shall be issued unless
it conforms to all applicable ordinances, statutes, and regulations.
   (C)   All questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be initially
presented and determined by the Zoning Officer. Subsequent recourse shall be,
in order, to the Board of Zoning Appeals and the courts.
   (D)   Upon finding that provisions of this code have been violated, notify
the person or party in writing responsible for the violation(s), order the
action necessary to correct the violation, and if correction is not completed
within the time specified in the notice of violation, begin legal actions
necessary to compel correction of the violation.
   (E)   Maintain official zoning maps.
   (F)   Provide information on planning and zoning upon request by citizens
and public agencies.
   (G)   Submit at least annually, a written report on all permits issued and
notice and orders issued.
   (H)   Perform additional tasks and duties as may be prescribed by the City
Council.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.022 ZONING PERMIT.

enlarged, or otherwise structurally altered until a zoning permit has been
issued by the Zoning Officer.
   (B)   Applications for a zoning permit shall be made available at City Hall.
   (C)   All applications for zoning permits shall be made in writing by the
owner or authorized agent and shall be filed with the Zoning Officer. The
application shall:
      (1)   Include a statement as to the proposed use of the structure or
land.
      (2)   Be accompanied by a plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions of
the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location of the building to be
constructed upon the lot, and accessory buildings to be erected, and such other
information as may be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer in determining and
provided for the enforcement of this chapter.
   (D)   If the zoning permit application is approved by the Zoning Officer,
then an appropriate placard issued by the city and containing the approval of
the Zoning Officer, shall be returned together with the zoning permit to the
applicant, following payment of the appropriate fee as determined by City
Council. The placard shall be posted by the applicant in a conspicuous place
upon the building or construction site prior to the commencement of any
construction and shall remain upon the building or construction site during all
construction operations.
   (E)   A zoning permit does not alleviate the necessity to obtain a building
permit as required by the city.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.023 FEES.
   Fees to be charged for the issuance of a zoning permit shall be determined
by a schedule maintained at City Hall.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.024 AMENDMENTS TO THIS CHAPTER.
   The City Council may amend this chapter. Before amending this chapter, the
City Council with the advice of the Planning Commission, must find that the
amendment is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan. If the amendment
is inconsistent, then the governing body with the advice of the Planning
Commission, must find that there have been major changes of an economic,
physical, or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated
when the comprehensive plan was adopted and those changes have substantially
altered the basic characteristics of the area.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.025 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.

   (A)   Within ten days of receipt of the appeal by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the Board shall set a time for the hearing of the appeal and give
notice. The hearing on the appeal must be held within 45 days of receipt of the
appeal by the Board.
   (B)   At least 15 days prior to the date set for the hearing on the appeal,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall publish a notice of the date, time, and place

   (E)   Every decision by the board must be in writing and state findings of
fact and conclusions of law on which the Board based its decision. If the Board
fails to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate for decision
by the Circuit Court and as a result of the failure, the Circuit Court returns
an appealed matter to the Board and dismisses jurisdiction over an applicant’s
appeal without deciding the matter, whether the court returns the matter with
or without restrictions, the Board shall pay any additional costs for court
filing fees, service of process, and reasonable attorneys’ fees required to
permit the person appealing the Board’s decision to return the matter to the
Circuit Court for completion of the appeal.
   (F)   The written decision by the Board shall be rendered within 30 days
after the hearing.
   (G)   If the Board fails to render a written decision within 30 days after

   (H)   When an appeal has been filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises in question shall be stayed, except as
provided below:
      (1)   If the official or board from where the appeal was taken certifies
in writing to the Board of Zoning Appeals that a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property;
      (2)   Upon further administrative proceedings, including, but not limited
to, submissions to and reviews by the staff or any administrative body; or
      (3)   Upon engineering or architectural work that does not disturb the
real estate beyond what is necessary to complete engineering, survey work, or
other tests.
   (I)   Petition for writ of certiorari. The final decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by the Circuit Court of Randolph
County, West Virginia, by certiorari, as provided by W.Va. Code §§ 8A-9-1 et
seq.
   (J)   Nothing in this section prevents a party from obtaining an injunction.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.028 VARIANCES.
   (A)   A VARIANCE is a deviation from the minimum standards of this code and
shall not involve permitting land uses that are otherwise prohibited in the
zoning district nor shall it involve changing the zoning classifications of a
parcel of land.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant a variance to this code if it
finds that the variance:
      (1)   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare, or
the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
      (2)   Arises from special conditions or attributes which pertain to the
property for which a variance is sought and which were not created by the
person seeking the variance;
      (3)   Would eliminate an unnecessary hardship and permit a reasonable use
of the land; and
      (4)   Will allow the intent of this code to be observed and substantial
justice done.
   (C)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a variance to allow the
establishment of a use in a zoning district when such use is prohibited by the
provisions of this code.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.029 CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   The conditional use permit procedure is intended to provide the Board
of Zoning Appeals with review of requests to establish uses that may be
appropriate in a zoning district, but that may have the potential for negative
impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The conditional use
standards provided in this subchapter are intended to avoid, minimize, or
mitigate adverse impacts conditional uses may have on the health, safety, and
welfare of the public.
   (B)   All applications for a conditional use permit shall demonstrate that:
      (1)   The use is consistent with the policies and intent of the
corresponding purpose for the zoning district in which it lies and the city’s
comprehensive plan.
      (2)   The use is physically and operationally compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and surrounding existing uses.
      (3)   The use will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so
that it does not cause substantial injury to adjoining property.
      (4)   The use will be adequately served by public facilities and services
which include but are not limited to water, sewer, electric, schools, streets,
fire and police protection, storm drainage, public transit, and public parks
and trails.
      (5)   Adequate off-street parking will be provided on the same property
as the proposed conditional use as well as adequate ingress and egress to the
property in compliance with the standards set forth in this code.
      (6)   Any storage of hazardous material will comply with all state,
federal, and local regulations, and all such material will be listed and made
known to the Chief of the City of Elkins Fire Department.
      (7)   The use will not endanger public health or safety or constitute a
public nuisance.
      (8)   The use will not conduct operations in connection with the use
which are offensive, dangerous, or destructive of the environment.
   (C)   Conditions may be imposed on a proposed conditional use to ensure that
potential significant adverse impacts on surrounding uses will be reduced to
the maximum extent feasible, including but not limited to conditions or
measures addressing:
      (1)   Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse
impacts such as noise and glare;
      (2)   Hours of operation and deliveries;
      (3)   Location of loading space and delivery zones;
      (4)   Light intensity and hours of full illumination;
      (5)   Placement of outdoor vending machines;
      (6)   Loitering;
      (7)   Litter control;
      (8)   Placement of trash receptacles;
      (9)   On-site parking configuration and facilities;
      (10)   On-site circulation; and
      (11)   Privacy concerns of adjacent uses.
   (D)   Conditional use permit decisions are made by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA). In considering the proposed conditional use, the BZA must
determine whether the applicable general standards under this subchapter have
been met. The BZA may impose additional conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary.
   (E)   The breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement shall be
considered a violation of the conditional use permit approval. If the applicant
fails to comply with any of the applicable requirements of this chapter, the
BZA shall have the authority to revoke any conditional use permit after
providing notice to the property owner and after public hearing is held in the
same manner as the original approval.
   (F)   Validity of approval. Any conditional use approved by the Board of
Zoning Appeals under which the premises are not used, work is not started
within six months, or the use or work has been abandoned for a period of one
year, shall lapse and cease to be in effect. The BZA may permit one six-month
extension if the extension is applied for in writing by the applicant prior to
the expiration of the approval, provided that the BZA finds that the extension
is warranted due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.
   (G)   No application which has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of
the last denial, unless permitted by the BZA after demonstration by the
applicant of a change of circumstances from the previous application.

NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
§ 152.040 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This purpose of this subchapter is to set forth standards and
regulations regarding the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots
established prior to the effective date of this chapter (or any amendment
subsequent thereto) that do not conform to this chapter. These standards shall
apply to all nonconforming uses, structures, and lots, as defined by this code.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.041 GENERAL PROVISIONS.

   (B)   Nothing in this code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition any portion of a nonconforming structure declared unsafe by a
proper authority.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as authorization for or
approval of the continuance of the illegal use of a structure or premises in
violation of zoning controls in existence at the time of the effective date of
legal enactment of this code.
   (D)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall apply to any nonconformities
existing therein.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits alterations or additions to or
replacement of buildings or structures owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer, or the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing
purposes, or the use or acquisition of additional land which may be required
for the protection, continuing development, or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial, or manufacturing operation of any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing use.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.042 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any
zoning district that is a nonconforming use as defined by this code.
   (B)   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, a
lawful use of a lot or structure exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this code as enacted or amended, such use may be sold or
otherwise transferred to other owners and may be continued as long as it
remains otherwise lawful in accordance with the provisions of this code.
   (C)   Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of a nonconforming use.
   (D)   No nonconforming use of a lot or nonconforming use of a structure
shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of the lot
or structure than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this code.
   (E)   Once a nonconforming use has been changed or converted to a conforming
use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
   (F)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 months, abandonment is
presumed and the nonconforming use shall not be allowed to be re-established.
If the property has been abandoned, then any future use of the land, buildings,
or structures shall conform and be in accordance with all applicable rules,
regulations, and requirements of the particular zoning district wherein the
property is located.
   (G)   Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall be presumed if one or more of
the following conditions exists, indicating intent on the part of the property
owner to abandon the nonconforming use:
      (1)   Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property have
been disconnected;
      (2)   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair as
evidenced by proper code violation documentation;
      (3)   When it has been replaced by a conforming use;
      (4)   When it has been changed to a use permitted by conditional use by
the Board of Zoning Appeals; or
      (5)   The business license issued by the city has expired.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999

SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
§ 152.160 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish standards and policies for
specific uses in all districts that require particular considerations. These
regulations will supplement general development standards by establishing
uniform criteria for each use—whether a permitted use by right or a conditional
use—and are set forth to achieve compatibility with the principal uses
permitted in a zoning district. The provisions for this subchapter shall apply
in addition to any other applicable zoning regulations.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.161 ADULT BUSINESS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this section have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (B)   Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the City Council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions
incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 541

not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden
Cove, California -1991; Houston, Texas - 1983; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-

Kennedale, Texas - 2005; Effingham, Illinois - 2005; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; El
Paso, Texas -1986; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of
the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
      (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm, which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the city’s rationale for this section, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the city’s interests in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extend to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (C)   No such adult establishment shall be located less than 1,000 feet from
a school zone, place of worship, library, day care center, civic building,
park, historic district, dwelling, lot with residential districting, or other
adult establishment as measured from front door to front door along the curb
line of public streets providing access.
   (D)   All doors, windows, and other apertures shall be located and covered
or screened with opaque glazing to discourage and prevent visibility or viewing
of the interior.
   (E)   No exterior signage, building element, advertisement, display, or
other promotional material shall be pornographic in nature or convey any such
idea or element to specified anatomical areas, as defined in this code.
   (F)   In the event that an activity or business which might fall under a use
category other than adult business is combined with or includes activities
which constitute an adult bookstore, adult movie theater or movie house, or
adult entertainment, as defined herein, then such activity or business shall
constitute an adult business and shall be governed by those provisions in this
code applicable to adult business uses, in addition to those provisions that
govern the combined use.

§ 152.183 WIND ENERGY FACILITY, SMALL.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of small wind energy facilities while promoting
the safe, effective, and efficient use of such facilities.
   (B)   Applicability. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern
the siting of wind energy facilities used to generate electricity or perform
work that may be connected to the utility grid pursuant to West Virginia’s net
metering laws, serve as an independent source of energy, or serve in a hybrid
system.
   (C)   Siting requirements. The requirements for siting and construction of
all small wind energy facilities regulated by this section shall include the
following:
      (1)   Small wind energy towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish,
unless FAA standards require otherwise, or if the owner is attempting to
conform the tower to the surrounding environment and architecture, in which
case it may be painted to reduce visual obtrusiveness. A wind energy tower may
be erected, maintained, or operated on or as an attachment to a building on a
lot. A photo simulation may be required by the city.
      (2)   Wind energy facilities shall not be artificially lighted unless
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or appropriate authority.
      (3)   No tower may be used to display a sign.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide evidence that the proposed height of
the wind energy facilities tower does not exceed the height recommended by the
manufacturer or distributor of the system. The tower height shall not exceed a
maximum height of 70 feet on a parcel. When situated on or attached to a
building, the total height shall not exceed 70 feet. The building itself shall
otherwise conform to the applicable height requirement under this section.
      (5)   The applicant shall provide evidence that the provider of electric
utility service to the site has been informed of the applicant’s intent to
install an interconnected, customer-owned electricity generator, unless the
applicant intends, and so states on the application, that the system will not
be connected to the electricity grid. Notification will take place by having
the electric utility provider sign the conditional use permit application, but
such signature does not construe approval for net metering by the electric
utility.
      (6)   Wind energy facilities shall adhere to noise limits as established
by city ordinances. These levels, however, may be exceeded during short-term
events such as utility outages or severe windstorms.
      (7)   The applicant will provide information demonstrating that the
system will be used primarily to reduce on-site consumption of electricity.
      (8)   The minimum distance between the ground and any protruding blade
utilized on a small wind energy facility shall be 15 feet, as measured at the
lowest point of the arc of the blades. The lowest point of the arc of the
blades shall be ten feet above the height of any structure within 75 feet of
the base. The supporting tower shall be enclosed with a six-foot tall fence or
the base of the tower shall not be climbable for a distance of ten feet.
      (9)   The applicant will provide proof of adequate liability insurance
for a small wind energy facility. Whether or not the applicant is participating
in the net metering program, the applicant will be required to meet the
insurance coverage requirements as set forth in W.Va. Admin. Code § 150-33-4
(2011).
      (10)   The small wind energy facility generators and alternators should
be constructed so as to prevent the emission of radio and television signals
and shall comply with the provisions of Section 47 of the Federal Code of
Regulations, Part 15 and subsequent revisions governing said emissions.
   (D)   Federal and state requirements.
      (1)   Compliance with the Building Code. Building permit applications for
wind energy facilities shall be accompanied by standard drawings of the wind
turbine structure, including tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis
of the tower showing compliance with the Building Code and certified by a
licensed professional engineer shall also be submitted.
      (2)   Compliance with FAA regulations. Wind energy facilities must comply
with applicable FAA regulations.
      (3)   Compliance with National Electric Code. Building permit
applications for wind energy facilities shall be accompanied by a line drawing
of the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a determination
that the manner of installation conforms to the National Electrical Code.
      (4)   Compliance with regulations governing energy net metering. Wind
energy facilities connected to the utility grid must comply with W.Va. Code §
24-2F-8 and W.Va. Admin. Code § 150-33.
      (5)   Setbacks. The wind energy facilities shall be setback a distance at
least equal to 110% of the height of the tower plus the blade length from all
adjacent property lines and a distance equal at least to 150% of the tower
height plus blade length from any dwelling inhabited by humans on neighboring
property. No portion of the wind energy facility, including guy wire anchors,
may be extended closer than ten feet to the property line.
      (6)   Removal of defective or abandoned wind energy facilities. Any wind
energy facility found to be unsafe by the Zoning Officer shall be repaired by
the owner to meet federal, state, and local safety standards or removed within
six months. Any wind energy facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the facility
shall remove the turbine within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Zoning
Officer instructing the owner to remove the abandoned wind energy facility.

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 152.220 FINDINGS; PURPOSE; INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the size, color, illumination,
movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values; preservation of the character of the various neighborhoods; creation of
a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This subchapter allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of signs. These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms
that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they
strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by
means of signs while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.
   (B)   This subchapter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this subchapter
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall
not affect the validity of other provisions of this subchapter that can be
given effect without the invalid provision.
   (C)   Signs not expressly permitted under this code are prohibited.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.221 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Application for permit. Except as provided in this code, a permit is
required prior to the display and erection of any sign.
      (1)   An application for a permit shall be filed with the Zoning Officer
on forms furnished by the city. The applicant shall provide sufficient
information to determine if the proposed sign is permitted under this code and
other applicable law. An application for a temporary sign shall state the dates
intended for the erection and removal of the sign. All applications shall
demonstrate that the materials used for the sign are appropriate for the
particular sign type; the submission of manufacturer’s specifications is
sufficient to demonstrate the use of appropriate materials. An application for
an electronic message display shall include the manufacturer’s statement that
the sign has been pre-programmed, to the extent possible, to conform to the
requirements of this code. Such manufacturer’s statement shall include, where
applicable, the pre-stacked sign settings related to text and graphic features,
message change features, message change time intervals, day and night lighting
requirements, and any other settings capable of limiting the electronic message
display such that the sign conforms to this code.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall promptly process the permit application
and approve the application, reject the application, or notify the applicant of
deficiencies in the application within 20 business days after receipt. Any
application that complies with all provisions of this code, the building code,
and other applicable laws shall be approved.
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Zoning Officer shall provide a
list of the reasons for the rejection in writing. An application shall be
rejected for noncompliance with the terms of this code, building code, or other
applicable law.
   (B)   Permit fee. A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all permit
applications. The permit fee schedule shall be set by the city. If the sign is
part of a new construction or renovation project, the cost of the permit fee
shall be included in the total project permit fee.
   (C)   Duration and revocation of permit. If a sign is not installed within
six months following the issuance of a permit or the time period stated within

§ 152.222 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.
   The purpose of not requiring a permit for some signage is to exempt certain
signs that are frequently used, often by private citizens, and that typically
have less of an impact on the public safety and aesthetic concerns of the
community. Signs permitted under this section count towards the maximum sign
area and maximum number of signs allowed per use. A permit is not required for:
   (A)   Signs required by law.
   (B)   Flags up to 16 square feet.
   (C)   The changing of messages on marquees and the repair of an existing
permitted sign, except that repair of a nonconforming sign must comply with
this code.
   (D)   Temporary signs as follows, subject to sign area and height
limitations of the district in which the sign is located:
      (1)   One sign, no illumination, no more than 32 square feet in area,
located on property where a building permit is active.
      (2)   On any property for sale or rent, one sign with a total area of up
to six square feet and a maximum height of five feet.
      (3)   On dwellings, no more than four temporary signs with a total area
of no more than 12 square feet.
      (4)   Window signs, provided that the total area of window signs does not
exceed 25% of the total area of all windows on each building facade, and such
signs are removed within 30 days after being erected.
      (5)   Banners for not more than 15 days as accessory to dwellings.
   (E)   Two minor signs per use.
   (F)   Pavement markings. Any sign applied directly and entirely to and flush
with an asphalt, concrete, or similar paved surface.
   (G)   A permanent window sign, provided that the aggregate area of all
window signs on each window or door does not exceed 25% percent of the total
area of the window or door.
   (H)   A-frame signs, provided they are placed inside of business hours, do
not exceed six square feet per side, and are on-premises signs. A-frame signs
shall not block pedestrian rights-of-way.

§ 152.223 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   The purpose of prohibiting the following signage is to address the city’s
substantial public safety and welfare concerns, including aesthetic concerns
and protecting property values, associated with certain types of signage. In
addition to signs prohibited elsewhere in this code or by applicable state or
federal law, the following signs are prohibited:
   (A)   General prohibitions.

displayed on a vehicle, if the vehicle or trailer is used primarily to display
a commercial message, and it fails to display current license plates,
inspection sticker, or municipal decal; if the vehicle is inoperable; if
evidence of paid-to-date local taxes cannot be made available; or if the sign
alters the standard design of such vehicle or trailer.
      (5)   Animated signs, except where animated sign features as part of an
electronic message display are expressly permitted.

(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.224 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All signs must conform to federal and state law, including but not
limited to the Building Code and W. Va. Code Adm. Code § 157-6-7, Requirements
for Outdoor Advertising on the State Highway System. Where this code and
federal or state law govern signage, the strictest provisions shall apply.
   (B)   Signs erected by the city for governmental purposes are not subject to
this subchapter.
   (C)   Setback and placement. Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein,
all freestanding signs and flagpoles shall be set back from any public right-
of-way at least the height of the sign or flagpole. Electronic message displays
shall be placed perpendicular to residential structures where possible and
shall comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, including the
avoidance of harmful interference with radio frequencies.
   (D)   Illumination. The purpose of the following provisions regulating
signage lighting is to ensure that signs are lighted in such a manner as to
maintain aesthetic consistency with signs already existing in the city and to
ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians, while also ensuring that signs
are adequately able to convey sign messages.
      (1)   Definitions.
         CANDELA. The basic unit of measurement of light in SI (metric) units.
         CANDELA PER SQUARE METER (CD/M2). The SI (metric) unit used to
describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface that
reflects light. Also referred to as NITS.
         NIT. A photometric unit of measurement referring to luminance. One NIT
is equal to one CD/M2.
         SI (INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS). The modem metric system of
measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term “Le Systeme International
d’Unites.”
      (2)   Signs may be backlit, internally lighted, or indirectly lighted.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.
      (3)   Temporary signs shall not be lighted.
      (4)   Signs that are illuminated at night may not exceed a maximum
luminance level of 750 cd/m2 or nits, regardless of the method of illumination,
at least one-half hour before apparent sunset, as determined by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Department of
Commerce, for the specific geographic location and date. All illuminated signs
must comply with this maximum luminance level throughout the night, if the sign
is energized, until apparent sunrise, as determined by NOAA, at which time the
sign may resume luminance levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (5)   The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between apparent
sunrise and one-half hour before apparent sunset, shall be 10,000 cd/m2 or
nits.
   (E)   Maximum height measurements. Signs with sign structures not affixed to
the ground are measured from the lowest attached component of the sign to the
highest attached component of the sign. The height of signs with sign
structures affixed to the ground is measured as the distance from the base of
the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the
sign, subject to limitations in this subchapter. Normal grade is the lower of:
      (1)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.
   (F)   Measurement of sign area. Sign area is calculated under the following
principles:
      (1)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
      (2)   The permitted area of a double-faced a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.
      (3)   For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)   Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structures are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.
      (5)   All signs displayed, whether permanent or temporary, and regardless
of the type of sign are counted toward the maximum sign area allowed per use.
   (G)   Electronic message display (EMD) signs. Static electronic message
display signs and the static electronic message display with transition feature
signs are permitted only as monument signs, except in the instance of multi-
tenant signs at shopping centers.
   (H)   Number of signs. All signs displayed on a lot, whether permanent or
temporary, and regardless of the type of sign are counted towards the maximum
number of signs permitted per use.
   (I)   Wall signs. Wall signs shall provide as part of permit application:
      (1)   Express permission from the operator and/or owner of the building;
      (2)   The name and address of the person applying the wall sign; and
      (3)   A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions and
location.
   (J)   The back of any permanent sign must be shielded from public view by a
building, other structure, high planting, or another sign of the same size,
where permitted, unless such back is painted a neutral color or is enclosed in
a solid metal backing that is treated or painted against corrosion.

§ 152.225 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this code that do not
conform to the provisions of this code, and signs that are accessory to a
nonconforming use shall be deemed nonconforming signs and may remain except as
qualified below.
      (1)   Temporary nonconforming signs are prohibited.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged nor shall any feature of
a nonconforming sign, such as illumination or technology, be increased.
      (3)   Nonconforming signs shall not be extended, structurally
reconstructed, altered in any manner, or replaced with another nonconforming
sign nor increased in technological advancement, except as permitted by this
subchapter.
      (4)   Nonconforming signs shall not be moved for any distance on the same
lot or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign
conform in all respects to the provisions of this subchapter.
      (5)   A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any casualty
to an extent not exceeding 30% of the sign’s area, as defined in §
152.224(F), may be restored within 30 days after such destruction or damage,
but shall not be enlarged, nor may the sign’s nonconformity be increased. If
such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding 30% of the sign’s
area, the sign shall not be reconstructed but may be replaced with a sign that
is in full accordance with this code.
      (6)   Nonconforming sign structures shall be removed if the use to which
they are accessory has not been in operation for a period of one year or more,
except as provided in §
152.226(F). Such sign structure shall be removed or made conforming by the
owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove or make
conforming the sign structure within 30 days of notice by the Zoning Officer,
the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be made conforming or removed and the
cost of such removal or modification shall be charged to the owner, person
having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due
within 30 days of notice of charges.
      (7)   If a nonconforming sign is altered such that the sign is conforming
or is replaced by a conforming sign, such sign shall thereafter be kept in
accordance with the provisions of this code.
   (B)   The burden of establishing nonconforming status of signs and the
physical characteristics and location of such signs shall be with the owner of
the property. Upon notice from the Zoning Officer, a property owner shall
submit verification that sign(s) were lawfully erected. Failure to provide such
verification shall cause the sign to be deemed an illegal sign.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall prevent keeping a nonconforming sign in
good repair.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.226 MAINTENANCE; REMOVAL.
   (A)   All signs shall be constructed and mounted in compliance with the West
Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. All signs and components thereof
shall be maintained in good repair and in a safe, neat, and clean condition.
   (B)   Safety hazard. The Zoning Officer may cause to have removed or
repaired immediately without written notice any sign that has become insecure,
in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, and, as such, presents an immediate
threat to the safety of the public. If such action is necessary to render a
sign safe, the cost of such emergency removal or repair shall be charged to the
owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with
payment due within 30 days of notice of charges.
   (C)   Nuisance. Any sign that constitutes a nuisance shall be abated by the
owner within 30 days of notice by the Zoning Officer. At any time, the Zoning
Officer may cause the nuisance to be abated with the costs charged to the
owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with
payment due within 30 days of notice of charges.
   (D)   Illegal sign and disrepair. Any sign that is illegal or in disrepair
shall be made conforming, removed, or repaired within 30 days of notice from
the Zoning Officer. Signs of disrepair include chipped paint, missing or
significantly faded letters or other aspects of the sign, cracked portions of
the sign face, broken lighting, graffiti, and unleveled portions of the sign
structure or face. If an illegal sign or a sign in disrepair is not made
conforming or repaired, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed or
repaired and the cost of such removal or repair shall be charged to the owner,
person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment
due within 30 days of notice of charges.
   (E)   Expired permit. Any sign for which a permit has expired shall be
removed within five days of the permit expiration. If the sign is not removed,
the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed and the cost of such
removal shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within 30 days of notice of
charges.
   (F)   The owner of any commercial sign, whether conforming or nonconforming
located on commercial property where the use or business has ceased operating
shall, within 60 days of the cessation of the use or business operation, remove
temporary signs and all aspects of any permanent sign with a commercial
message. Property owners may request, in writing, a waiver of such requirement,
if the businesses are temporarily or seasonally operational, is remodeling, or
otherwise has the good will intention of resuming the use within one year of
time of cessation.

§ 152.227 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Temporary signs pose distinct concerns with visual clutter, safety in
erection and display, and removal when the time for display has concluded.
Temporary signs also pose distinct concerns with materials quality. The
following provisions and individual zoning of temporary signs per district
serve to address these concerns:
   (A)   Temporary signs require a permit, except as provided in this
subchapter, and may be permitted up to 30 days each calendar year. No more than
four temporary commercial signs may be erected per use in one calendar year.
   (B)   Temporary signs shall be securely affixed to the ground or a building,
or a pole designated only to a temporary sign. Temporary signs shall be durably
constructed of weather resistant material.
   (C)   Person-assisted signs shall not be located more than ten feet from the
entrance to a building or within ten feet of a right-of-way.

152.999
§ 152.228 SIGNS FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-1) AND CITY RESIDENTIAL (R-2)
DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose. Signage in residential districts poses a heightened risk of
visual blight and unsightly clutter, as residential neighborhoods typically
contain markedly less signage than other districts in order to maintain the
residential character of the neighborhood. At the same time, communicating from
one’s residence is a distinct and impactful form of speech that should be
protected, and nonresidential uses should be afforded adequate signage
incidental to the primary use, i.e., on-premises signs. Signs permitted in
these districts are smaller, fewer in number, and limited in sign type in order
to limit visual clutter and distraction, while affording ample speech.
      (1)   Signs permitted as accessory to dwellings.
         (a)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to dwellings.
Geological, minor, temporary, topiary, wall, and window signs. No more than
four permanent signs are permitted by right per dwelling.
         (b)   Permitted temporary sign use as accessory to dwellings. Banner,
minor, pennant, wall, wicket, window. No more than four temporary signs are
permitted in one calendar year per dwelling.
         (c)   No more than four flags as accessory to a dwelling, excluding
any flags that are minor signs.
      (2)   Signs permitted as accessory to non-dwellings.
         (a)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings.
Freestanding, geological, minor, monument, temporary, topiary, wall, and window
signs. Only one of each is permitted per use per frontage, except wall signs
and window signs. No more than four permanent signs are permitted by right per
use. No more than four temporary signs are permitted in one calendar year per
use.
         (b)   Permitted temporary sign use as accessory to non-dwellings. A-
frame, banner, chalkboard, minor, wall, wicket, window. No more than four
temporary signs are permitted in one calendar year per use.
         (c)   No more than four flags as accessory to a non-dwelling are
permitted.
      (3)   Off-premises signs are prohibited for both dwellings and non-
dwellings.
   (B)   Dimension specifications chart. All maximum sign area requirements
include the sum total sign area of all signs per use per frontage, unless
otherwise specified.

§ 152.229 SIGNS FOR RECREATIONAL (REC) DISTRICT.
   Signage in the Recreational (Rec) District poses a heightened risk of visual
blight and unsightly clutter, as recreational areas typically contain markedly
less signage particularly in areas where there is vast open space. As a result,
signs in the Recreational (Rec) District should be smaller, fewer in number,
and limited in sign type in order to limit visual clutter and preserve natural
open space.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.230 SIGNS FOR CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. Signage in commercial and districts is allowed to a somewhat
greater extent, while maintaining proportion to the size and scope of uses
typically present. However, even these more intensive uses in smaller
communities are limited in signage to some degree in order to maintain small-
town character and limit visual distraction by signage.
      (1)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as
for §
152.228.
      (2)   Signs permitted as accessory to non-dwellings.
         (a)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings. A-
frame, awning, canopy, chalkboard, freestanding, geological, marquee, minor,
monument, neon, projecting, temporary, topiary, wall, and window signs. Only
one of each is permitted per use per frontage, except wall signs and window
signs. More than 200 square feet of frontage is required for a use to have more
than one pole sign. No more than six permanent signs are permitted by right per
use.
         (b)   Permitted temporary signs as accessory to non-dwellings. A-
frame, banner, chalkboard, minor, person-assisted, wall, wicket, window. No
more than six temporary signs are permitted in one calendar year per use.
         (c)   No more than three flags as accessory to a non-dwelling are
permitted.
      (3)   Off-premises signs are prohibited.

§ 152.232 SIGNS FOR INDUSTRIAL (I-1) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. Signage in heavier commercial and industrial districts is
allowed to a greater extent, in size, number, and sign type, in order to
maintain proportion to the size and scope of uses typically present within
these districts. However, even the most intensive use districts in smaller

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
§ 152.240 PURPOSE.
   This chapter seeks to ensure the citizens of the city have access to
wireless telecommunication technology, to protect the residents of the city
from the proliferation of freestanding towers, and to provide a process and
standards for the construction, maintenance, and modification of wireless
telecommunication facilities through the following:
   (A)   Establishing clear guidelines, standards, and time frames for the
exercise of authority for wireless telecommunications facilities through the
city’s zoning, planning, and design standards;
   (B)   Allowing competition in telecommunications service;
   (C)   Encouraging the provision of advanced telecommunications services to
the largest number of businesses, institutions, and residents of the city;
   (D)   Encouraging the location, design, and construction of wireless
telecommunication facilities that will have minimal impact on the location,
minimal visual impact on the scenic resources, and minimize the total number of
towers and tower sites throughout the city;
   (E)   Permitting reasonable access to the public rights-of-way for
telecommunications facilities on a competitively neutral basis;
   (F)   Ensuring that all telecommunications carriers providing facilities or
services comply with federal, state, and local regulations;
   (G)   Encouraging the use of existing structures as an alternative to new
wireless telecommunications facility construction, including the collocation of
new and existing wireless telecommunications facilities, thus helping to
minimize adverse visual impacts on the community; and
   (H)   Protecting the scenic and visual character of the community.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 152.241 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Wireless telecommunications facilities may not be constructed or
modified without a zoning permit issued in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter. Modifications to existing wireless telecommunication
facilities, as of the effective date of this subchapter, are required to comply
with this subchapter.
   (B)   This chapter does not apply to the replacement of any component of a
wireless telecommunication facility where the replacement is identical to the
component being replaced or to the normal repair and maintenance of a wireless
telecommunication facility that does not involve the addition, removal, or
change of any of the externally discernable physical components of a wireless
telecommunication facility from that which was originally permitted.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.242 SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE CRITERIA.
   For the purposes of determining whether a requested modification is an
eligible facilities request for modification under this section, a proposed
facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimensions of an
eligible support structure, and therefore not be eligible for the expedited
modification process and corresponding eligible facilities application process
under this subchapter, if the requested modification meets any of the following
criteria:
   (A)   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the
requested increases the height of the tower by more than 10% or by the height
of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing
antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support
structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than 10% or more
than ten feet, whichever is greater.
   (B)   Changes in height shall be measured from the original support
structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally,
such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height shall
be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of
originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved
prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.
   (C)   For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, it involves
adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the
edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower
structure at the level of appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other
eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of
the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than
six feet.
   (D)   For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more
than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved,
but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public right-of-way and
base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than
10% larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets
associated with the structure.
   (E)   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site.
   (F)   It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure.
   (G)   It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval
of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base
station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to
any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed
the thresholds identified in this section.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.243 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Lighting. Lighting affixed to any wireless telecommunication
facilities shall meet, but not exceed, the minimum lighting required by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For any application where lighting is
required, the applicant shall submit documentation from the FAA stating that
the proposed lighting meets all applicable FAA standards and regulations.
   (B)   Structural standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall
conform to the most current versions of the ANSI/ASSE A10.48 “Standard Criteria
for Safety Practices with the Construction, Demolition, Modification and
Maintenance of Communication Structures”; ANSI/TIA-222 Standard, “Structural
Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small Wind Turbine
Support Structures”; and ANSI/TIA-322 Standard, “Loading, Analysis and Design
Criteria Related to the Installation, Alteration and Maintenance of
Communication Structures.” Wireless telecommunication facilities shall also
meet any applicable local building code standards.
   (C)   Height restrictions. No wireless telecommunication facility shall
exceed 199 feet in height, unless the applicant sufficiently justifies that the
height of the tower will eliminate other similar towers or that the provision
of service cannot be accomplished without a tower height in excess of 199 feet.
Any applicant proposing a wireless telecommunication facility greater than 199
feet in height must provide evidence that the applicant notified the FAA of the
intent to build the facility and received a final determination of “no hazard”
from the FAA. Wireless telecommunications facilities located atop or within an
alternative support structure may extend 10% above the height of the structure
or to the maximum height permitted in the zoning district in which the
structure is located, whichever is less.
   (D)   Collocation.
      (1)   An applicant for a new wireless telecommunication facility must
demonstrate by substantial evidence that a bona fide need exists for the
construction of a new tower and that no reasonable combination of locations,
techniques, or technologies would obviate the need. The applicant for a new
facility must further demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been made to
collocate wireless telecommunication facilities on existing towers or
alternative support structures.
      (2)   Prior to the approval of an application for a wireless
telecommunications facility, the applicant shall demonstrate commitment to
joint use as follows:
         (a)   The applicant shall submit evidence as part of the application
demonstrating that a genuine effort has been made to solicit additional users
for the proposed new wireless telecommunications facility. Evidence of this
shall include, at a minimum, copies of notices sent by registered mail, return
receipt requested, to all other providers of cellular and wireless
telecommunications services within the same county and within adjacent
counties, or a Class II legal advertisement, advising of the intent to
construct a new tower, identifying the location, inviting the joint use and
sharing of costs, and requesting a written response within 15 business days.
         (b)   As part of the application, the applicant shall attest that the
company will encourage the joint use of telecommunications towers within the
city, committing that there shall be no unreasonable act or omission that would
have the effect of excluding, obstructing, or delaying joint use of any tower
where fair and just market reasonable compensation is offered for such use.
         (c)   Wireless telecommunications facilities, other than alternative
support structures, shall be designed and built to accommodate a minimum of
three wireless telecommunications provider’s equipment. The owner of the tower,
if different than the applicant, must certify to the city that the tower is
available for use by other telecommunications service providers on a reasonable
and non-discriminatory basis.
   (E)   Concealment.
      (1)   All new or modified wireless telecommunication facilities must be
concealed in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the facilities
through careful design, siting, landscaping, screening, and innovative
camouflaging and stealth techniques, unless applicant shows substantial
evidence that to do so is impracticable.
      (2)   Concealment techniques include fake trees, parapet extensions,
silos, fake chimneys, water towers, fiberglass flagpoles, and steeples.
      (3)   A description must be included in the application of the
possibilities for concealment that have been explored, and why the proposed
option was chosen.
      (4)   Visual impact analysis of the wireless telecommunication facility
is required using existing information, predictive modeling techniques,
photographs, and simulations, to accurately and impartially communicate the
potential visual impacts from proposed project.
      (5)   If determined to be impracticable by Zoning Officer for a tower or
alternative support structure to be entirely concealed, the applicant will
describe how they will utilize materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping to blend facilities into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      (6)   If an antenna is installed on an alternative support structure, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral
color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the
alternative support structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment
as visually unobtrusive as possible.
      (7)   Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view
or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or
placed underground.
   (F)   Replacement or modification of any previously approved concealed tower
or facility must substantially conform to previous design characteristics.
   (G)   Setback. Each tower shall have a setback of at least 110% the tower
height measured from the tower base to the nearest property line.
   (H)   Collapse zone. No habitable structure may be located within the
proposed collapse zone. The applicant shall demonstrate that the entire
collapse zone is either under lease or owned by the applicant and that no
habitable structure will be constructed in the collapse zone while die tower is
standing.
   (I)   Equipment cabinets. No equipment cabinet for a wireless
telecommunications facility shall exceed 750 square feet in area, nor 12 feet
in height. All equipment cabinets shall be located with the tower and shall be
enclosed within a minimum of a six-foot security fence and a locked gate.
   (J)   Signs. No commercial messages nor any other signs beyond that which is
required, not to exceed 12 square feet cumulatively, shall be placed on any
tower, equipment cabinet, or security fence.
   (K)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible. Trees existing within 100 feet of the
wireless telecommunications facility shall not be removed except as required
for tower construction, security fence construction, installation of ingress or
egress, and the installation of utilities to the facility. To the extent that
existing vegetation is the basis for a waiver of the landscaping requirement,
preservation of such vegetation shall be a condition of the permit, and if such
existing vegetation is removed or destroyed, the applicant shall meet the
landscaping specified in division (K)(2) below within six months thereafter.
      (2)   Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be landscaped within
six months after the tower and base station are erected with a visual buffer of
plant materials that effectively screens the view of the equipment cabinet from
adjacent property. The standard visual buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip of at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the security fencing
enclosing the facilities. The visual buffer shall include vegetation of at
least eight feet tall, planted ten feet apart behind a contiguous hedge of
shrubs three feet deep. All plant materials shall be species native to West
Virginia. In the case where the tower and base station are sited on large
wooded lots, the applicant may request that the natural growth preserved around
the tower site be considered a sufficient visual barrier, without the need for
additional landscaping. Such a request shall accompany the application and
shall include photographs of the natural growth to be preserved.
   (L)   Location of towers or antenna in or near historic sites, historic
districts, and designated scenic resources. Applications for wireless
telecommunications facilities or antennas subject to this section shall also
demonstrate that the views of, and vistas from, such structures, districts, and
resources shall not be impaired or diminished by the placement of the proposed
tower or antennas. In no instance shall a wireless telecommunications facility
subject to the provisions of this division (L) exceed 199 feet in height.
   (M)   Site demarcation. The site shall be physically and visually marked in
the field, for immediate identification, with any combination of survey irons
or flags as needed during the application process or during construction.

            2.   Evidence that existing facilities do not have sufficient
height and cannot be increased in height at a cost not exceeding 50% of the
cost required to construct the existing tower in present-day dollars, to meet
the applicant’s engineering requirements.
            3.   Evidence that existing facilities do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant’s proposed antenna and related
equipment. Specifically:
               A.   Planned, necessary equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing facility, considering the existing and planned use of
the existing facilities, and the existing facilities cannot be reinforced to
accommodate the new equipment.
               B.   The applicant’s proposed antenna or equipment would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or
structures, or the antenna or equipment with the existing facility would cause
interference with the applicant’s proposed antenna.

planned equipment can be placed so it can function effectively.
            4.   Evidence that the fees, costs, or contractual provisions
required by the owner of the existing facility or structure in order to share
or adapt an existing facility are unreasonable, provided the existing facility
was constructed prior to the effective date of the subchapter. Costs exceeding
the pro rata share of a new facility development are presumed to be

§ 152.267 PERMIT APPLICATION PROCESSING.
   (A)   The city may prohibit or restrict the applicant from working within a
right-of-way when a road is closed, or its access is limited to the public.
   (B)   The applicant shall employ due care during the installation,
maintenance, or any other work in the right-of-way, and shall comply with all
safety and right-of-way protection requirements of applicable laws, codes,
guidelines, standards, and practices, and any additional commonly accepted
safety and public right-of-way protection standards, methods, and devices to
the extent consistent with applicable laws.
   (C)   Unless otherwise specified in the permit, the applicant shall erect a
barrier around the perimeter of any excavation and provide appropriate traffic
control devices, signs, and lights to protect, warn, and guide the public
(vehicular and pedestrian) through the work zone. The manner and use of these
devices shall be described within a traffic control plan in accordance with the
Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices. The applicant shall maintain all
barriers and other traffic control and safety devices related to an open
excavation until the excavation is restored to a safe condition or as otherwise
directed by the city.
   (D)   The applicant shall not interfere with any existing facilities or
structures in the right-of-way, and shall locate its lines and equipment in
such a manner as not to interfere with the usual traffic patterns (vehicular or
pedestrian) or with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property
that abuts any right-of-way.
   (E)   If the city determines that a small wireless facility or utility pole
violates the building code or otherwise creates a danger to the public’s
health, safety, and welfare, the city shall follow the processes and procedures
laid out in the West Virginia State Building Code.
   (F)   Any damage to the right-of-way directly caused by an applicant’s
activities in the right-of-way shall be repaired in order to return the right-
of-way to its functional equivalence before the damage. After the applicant
receives written notice, the city may assess a fine of $100 per day until the
repairs are completed. If the applicant fails to make the repairs required by
the city within a reasonable time after written notice, the city may complete
the repairs and charge the applicant for the reasonable, documented cost of the
repairs in addition to the $100 daily fine.
(Ord. 301, passed 8-18-2022) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.268 ADDITIONAL LOCAL RULES.
   (A)   The city is authorized to create reasonable rules for construction and
public safety in the rights-of-way, including wiring and cabling requirements,
grounding requirements, and abandonment and removal provisions, to the extent
any additional rules are necessary.
   (B)   These rules shall be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall
be posted publicly on the city’s website and shall be available to the public
in print at the City Clerk’s office. If the city determines that no additional
rules are necessary, the city’s website shall state that no additional rules
apply. The city may change the guidelines in a prospective manner for all
permit applications moving forward but shall not change requirements on any
applicant who has already applied for a permit. Each new or modified small
wireless facility or utility pole installed in the right-of-way shall comply
with the city current rules for construction and public safety as of the time
of the permit application.
