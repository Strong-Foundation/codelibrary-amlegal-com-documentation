Section
   
107.01   Purpose
   
107.02   Authorization to convey property for economic development
 
§ 107.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Municipalities within the state are generally required to sell real or
personal municipal property at public auction in accordance with W. Va. Code 8-
12-18(b); however, public auction of municipally-owned real estate does not
necessarily guarantee a fair price for the subject property nor does such sale
impose a requirement for economic development of said property.
   (B)   The governing body believes that it is its responsibility to ensure
that valuable commercial and/or residential property is ultimately developed
for the betterment of the city. The governing body and the Mayor believe that
this objective can best be accomplished by allowing the city to negotiate for
the sale and development of property and by imposing contractual obligations on
any potential purchasers and/or developers. This article shall not be
interpreted to relieve elected officials of their fiduciary obligations to the
residents of the city.
(Prior Code, § 107.01) (Ord. passed 12-16-2014; Ord. passed 1-2-2024)
§ 107.02 AUTHORIZATION TO CONVEY PROPERTY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to W. Va. Code 8-1-5a, Municipal Home Rule Program, the city
may sell its real or personal property valued in excess of $1,000 for fair
market value, but without public auction, provided that City Council has made a
factual determination, stated with particularity, that the monies from the sale
of said property are to be used to facilitate specific economic development
projects and/or to provide a specific, necessary and convenient benefit for the
community.
   (B)   Additionally, the city may sell its real or personal property valued
in excess of $1,000 for fair market value without public auction, only after
the city has made notice of the sale of said property, together with a brief
description of the property to be sold, by publication in a Class II legal
advertisement in compliance with W. Va. Code 59-3-1 et seq. The area of
publication shall be the City of Milton.
   (C)   Under no circumstance shall any property owned by the city, real or
personal, be sold in violation of W. Va. Code 6B-2-5.

or moped, when operated upon a street or highway, shall be equipped with breaks
adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold such vehicle,
including two separate means of applying the brakes, each of which means shall
be effective to apply the breaks to at least two wheels. If these two separate
means of applying the breaks are connected in any way, they shall be so
constructed that failure of any one part of the operating mechanism shall not
leave the motor vehicle without brakes on at least two wheels.
      (2)   Every motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, and moped, when operated upon
a street or highway, shall be equipped with at least one brake which may be
operated by hand or foot.
      (3)   Every trailer or semitrailer of a gross weight of 3,000 pounds or
more when operated upon a street or highway shall be equipped with brakes
adequate to control the movement of and to stop and to hold such vehicle and so
designed as to be applied by the driver of the towing motor vehicle from its
cab, and such brakes shall be so designed and connected that in case of an
accidental breakaway of the towed vehicle the brakes shall be automatically
applied.

such restraint is inappropriate.
   (C)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages; provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an
in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party’s failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of, upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine:
      (1)   That the injured party failed to wear a safety belt; and
      (2)   That the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a failure to
mitigate damages.
   (D)   The trier of fact may reduce the injured party’s recovery for medical
damages by an amount not to exceed 5% thereof. In the event the plaintiff
stipulates to the reduction of 5% of medical damages, the court shall make the
calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a
safety belt shall not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual
computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, no

prescribed by §
533.99(B) is not entitled to recover the penalty imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment

limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.

§ 713.02 IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.
   (A)   There is hereby levied and shall be collected annual privilege taxes
against persons, on account of the business and other activities and in the
amounts to be determined by the application of rates against values or gross
income as set forth in §§
713.03 to
713.12, commencing April 1, 1990, and subsequent years. If any person liable
for any tax under §§
713.03 or
713.04 ships or transports his or her products, or any part thereof, out of the
city without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of
the city shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in such
sections. The Recorder shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for
ascertaining such value.
   (B)   In determining value, however, regarding sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale,
the Recorder shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining the
value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as
possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like
quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   (C)   A person exercising any privilege taxable under §§
713.03 or
713.04 and engaging in the business of selling his or her manufactured products
at retail in this city shall be required to make returns of the gross proceeds
of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed in §
713.05 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such
manufactured products at retail in this city. But any person exercising any
privilege taxable under §§
713.03 or
713.04 and engaging in the business of selling his or her manufactured products
to producers of manufacturers, wholesalers, jobbers, retailers, or commercial
consumers for use or consumption in the purchaser’s business shall not be
required to pay the tax imposed in §
713.06.
   (D)   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under §
713.04 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in §
713.05 for the privilege of selling their manufactured products for delivery
outside of this city, but the gross income derived from the sale of such
manufactured products outside of this city shall be included in determining the
measure of the tax imposed on such manufacturer in §
713.04.
(Prior Code, § 713.02)
§ 713.03 MANUFACTURING, COMPOUNDING, OR PREPARING PRODUCTS; PROCESSING OF FOOD
EXCEPTED.
   (A) Upon every person engaging or continuing within this city in the
business of manufacturing, compounding, or preparing for sale, profit, or
commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others in whole or
in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or
commodities, or electric power not produced by public utilities taxable under
other provisions of this article, the amount of the tax shall be equal to the
article, substance, commodity, or electric power manufactured, compounded, or
prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof
by the manufacturer or person compounding or preparing the same, except as
otherwise provided, multiplied by a rate of 0.25%. The measure of this tax is
the value of the entire product manufactured, compounded, or prepared in this
state for sale, profit, or commercial use, regardless of the place of sale or
the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the city. However, the
dressing and processing of poultry and turkeys by a person, firm, or
corporation, which poultry and turkeys are to be sold on a wholesale basis by
such person, firm, or corporation, shall not be considered as manufacturing or
compounding, but the sale of these products, on a wholesale basis, shall be
subject to the same tax as is imposed on the business of selling at wholesale
as provided in §
713.05.
   (B)   It is further provided, however, that in those instances in which the
same person partially manufactures products within the city and partially
manufactures such products outside this city, the measure of his or her tax
under this section shall be that proportion of the sale price of the
manufactured product that the payroll cost of manufacturing with this city
bears to the entire payroll cost of manufacturing the product; or, at the
option the taxpayer, the measure of his or her tax under this section shall be
the proportion of the sales value of the articles that the cost of operation in
this city bears to the full cost of manufacture of the articles.
(Prior Code, § 713.03)
§ 713.04 BUSINESS OF SELLING TANGIBLE PROPERTY; CERTAIN SALES EXCEPT.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this city in the business of

power companies, 2.5% on sales and demand charge for domestic purposes and
commercial lighting and 2% on sales and demand charges for all other purposes;
natural gas companies, 2% on the gross income, such gross income for this
purposes to be determined by deducting from gross income from all sales of gas
to consumers the amount of the tax paid by the taxpayer on the production of
the same gas; toll bridge companies, 2% and upon all other public services or
utility businesses, 2%. The measure of the tax under this section shall include
only gross income received from the supplying of public services. The gross
income of the taxpayer from any other activity shall be included in the measure
of the tax imposed under the appropriate section or sections of this article.
(Prior Code, § 713.05)

   (A)   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax
year, each taxpayer shall make a return for the entire tax year showing the
gross proceeds of sales or gross income of business, trade, or calling, and

secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation.
   (B)   If made on behalf of a partnership, joint adventure, association,
trust, or any other group or combination acting as a unit, any individual
delegated by such firm, co-partnership, joint venture, association, trust, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf
of the taxpayer. The Recorder, for good cause shown, may extend the time for
making the annual return of the application of any taxpayer and grant such
reasonable additional time within which to make the same as may be deemed
advisable.

§ 713.15 ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   (A)   If the taxpayer makes any clerical error which is apparent on the face
of the return in computing the tax assessable against him or her, the Recorder
shall correct such error or reassess the proper amount of taxes, and notify the
taxpayer of his or her action by mailing to him or her promptly a copy of the
corrected assessment, and any additional tax for which such taxpayer may be
liable shall be paid within 15 days after the receipt of such statement.
   (B)   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on
the basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the Recorder, and shall be
payable out of any funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at his or
her election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing
hereunder.
(Prior Code, § 713.15) (Ord. passed 3-26-1990)
§ 713.16 ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Recorder believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed
to properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient, or otherwise erroneous, he or she may proceed
to investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and
make an assessment therefor.
(Prior Code, § 713.16) (Ord. passed 3-26-1990)
§ 713.17 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   If the Recorder believes that the collection of any tax which he or
she is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he or she shall
thereupon make an assessment to the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment.
The amount assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer
against whom a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within 20
days after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such assessment
becomes final.
   (B)   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy
assessment had been made shall be accompanied by such security as the Recorder
may deem necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(Prior Code, § 713.17) (Ord. passed 3-26-1990)
§ 713.18 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; HEARING.
   (A)   The Recorder shall give to the taxpayer written notice of any
assessment made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom a notice
of assessment is directed files within 30 days after service thereof (except in
the case of jeopardy assessments), either personally or by registered mail,
with the Recorder a petition in writing, verified under oath by the taxpayer or
his or her duly authorized agent, having knowledge of the facts, setting forth
with definiteness and particularity the items of the assessment objected to,
together with the reason for such objections, such assessments shall become and
be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall be payable at the end of the
30-day period.
   (B)   In every case where a petition for reassessment as above described is
filed, the Recorder shall assign a time and place for the hearing of the same
and shall notify the petitioner of such hearing by written notice at least 20
days in advance thereof and such hearing shall be held within 60 days from the
filing of the petition for reassessment unless continued by agreement or by the
Recorder for good cause. The hearing shall be informal and may be conducted by
an examiner designated by the Recorder. At such hearing, evidence may be
offered to support the assessment or to prove that it is incorrect. After such
hearing, the Recorder shall, within a reasonable time, give notice in writing
of the decision. Unless an appeal is taken within 30 days from service of this
notice, the Recorder’s decision shall be final.
(Prior Code, § 713.18) (Ord. passed 3-26-1990)
§ 713.19 APPEAL; BOND.
   (A)   An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer to the County Circuit Court,

§ 733.01 IMPOSITION.
   There is hereby imposed a municipal hotel tax, as hereinafter described,

writing to their destruction within that period or requires that they be kept
for a longer period.
(Prior Code, § 733.11)
§ 733.12 LIABILITY OF OFFICERS.

(Ord. passed 12-16-2014)
§ 776.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Council hereby finds and declares that:
   (A)   It is the intent of the Council that the municipal sales, service, and
use tax imposed by the provisions of this article, be complementary laws and
wherever possible be construed and applied to accomplish such intent as to the
imposition, administration, and collection of these taxes; and further, that
the taxes imposed pursuant to this article shall be in all respects consistent
with the imposition and collection of the state sales, service, and use tax
pursuant to W. Va. Code 11-15, 11-15a, and 11-15b;
   (B)   The Council understands that the collection of this tax will be
accomplished through the voluntary and cooperative efforts of the State Tax
Commissioner and his or her office and that the city is without authority to
compel the Tax Commissioner’s cooperation in this regard. Further, remittance
of all local sales, service, and use taxes to the state’s Department of Revenue
will allow for the efficient and consistent collection of local sales, service,
and use taxes for the state and its political subdivisions. Should any
provision contained herein conflict with state law, the same shall be stricken
and be of no further force and effect;
   (C)   On and after the first day of April 2011, the taxes levied by this
article shall also be administered and collected in accordance with the
provisions of this article and state law; and
   (D)   It is further the intention of Council to implement and enact W. Va.
Code 11-15a and 11-15b, as enacted and amended, as if the same were included in
their entirety herein.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2014)

of Council and the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, a copy of which
shall be posted in the Utility Commission business office. The accounts shall
be billed monthly unless otherwise directed in accordance with the billing
practices of the city’s municipal water works system. Each meter shall be
considered a separate billing unit in applying the rates.
   (B)   In the event any person, firm, or corporation discharging sanitary
sewage, industrial waste, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, and obtains part or all of the water
used from other sources than that furnished by the city’s municipal water works
system, which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter
not acceptable to the Utility Commission, then in each such case the user and
other interested parties shall at their own expense install and maintain water
meters satisfactory to the Commission on all supplies other than the city’s
municipal water works system water, and the quantity of water used to determine
the sewage charge shall be the sum of the quantity of water measured by all
meters.
   (C)   In the event that it is established to the satisfaction of the
Commission that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters
established by any of the provisions of this article does not and cannot enter
the sewerage system, then the Commission may determine in such manner and by
such method as it may find practicable the percentage of metered water entering
the sanitary sewerage system, or the Commission may require or permit the
installation of additional meters in such a manner as to determine the quantity
of water actually entering the sewerage system. The service charge shall be
based upon the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system subject
to any minimum charge provision.
   (D)   (1)   The city shall receive and treat any and all industrial wastes,
provided however, that Commission reserves the right to refuse to receive and
treat industrial wastes that are destructive to sewerage works or that
seriously disturb or interfere with the established sewage treatment processes.
      (2)   Periodic sampling and analysis of the wastes of the industries
concerned may be made. The frequency of sampling and analysis shall be as
determined by the city or as by agreement with the industries. If, upon such
examination, wastes are determined to be disturbing to the sewage treatment
processes, or materially increase the cost of sewage treatment processes, the
handling of such wastes shall be subject to the following terms and charges:
         (a)   For every part per million of biochemical oxygen demand or
suspended solids, whichever is the larger, that the industrial waste exceeds
the average sewage received at the sewage treatment plant during the period in
which the bill is to be rendered, the rate of charge shall be as set up in
division (A) above plus 0.25%;
         (b)   Whenever the hydrogen in concentration of industrial wastes as
measured by the pH value is less than 6.0 or greater than 8.0 during the period
in which the bill is rendered, the sewer service charge shall be that set up in
division (A) above plus 25%. However, in no case shall wastes having a pH value
less than 5.0 be acceptable; and
         (c)   This special rate shall not be put into effect until after the
offending industry has been given 30 days’ notice and no corrective measures
have been taken by it.
      (3)   The above special rates may apply to all or part of the wastes from
any particular industry.
   (E)   The sewerage charge shall be payable in accordance with the billing
practices of the city’s municipal water works system at its office, and the due
date shall be that specified on the statement for the sewerage service charge
presented to the user of the sewerage system.

service has been terminated for nonpayment of sewer bills.
      (9)   Returned payment charge. If a payment received is returned by the
bank for any reason, the bank’s charge to the city shall be the city’s charge
to the customer for such returned check and under no circumstances shall the
fee collected by the city exceed $25.
      (10)   Leak adjustment. An amount not to exceed $6.30 per 1,000 gallons
is to be used when a bill reflects unusual consumption which can be attributed
to eligible leakage on the customer’s side of the meter. This rate shall be
applied to all such consumption above the customer’s historical usage.
      (11)   Service charges for payments. A service charge will be imposed on
all credit/debit card payments. The amount shall be equal to the actual charges
to the utility from the financial institution for processing payment, or the
transaction fee set forth by the payment processing company.
   (B)   Schedule II; surcharge formula to be applied in cases where surface
drainage is connected to the city’s sanitary sewer system.
      (1)   Where the city has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, down
spouts, storm sewer, or other similar facilities conducting surface water have
been connected to the city’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action, within 30 days of receipt of a demand by the city in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission, to
eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
 
S = A x R x 0.0006233 x C
   Where:
S = The surcharge in dollars;
A = The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection surface
connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet;
R = The measured monthly rainfall, in inches;
0.0006233 = A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water; and
C = The city’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage.
      (2)   The utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the
customer has been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
hand delivery, that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or
on-site inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into
the sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has
not acted within 30 days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from
the sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that
said condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct
the situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
   (C)   Schedule III; Surcharge formula to be applied in the case of users
producing unusual waste.
      (1)   The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on
the basis of the following formula:
 
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
 
   Where:
Ci = charge to unusual users per year;
Vo = average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in
dollars per gallon;
Vi = volume of waste water from unusual users, in gallons per year;
Bo = average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) in dollars per year;
Bi = weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year;
So = average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment chargeable to
total solids, in dollars per pound; and
Si = weight of total solids from unusual users, in pounds per year.
      (2)   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its
wastes, and the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste
containing material which, in the judgment of the city’s Municipal Utilities
Commission, should not be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled
by it. The results of this preliminary study will be used to determine the
feasibility of the proposed sewer service and the charge thereof, based upon
the formula set out above.
      (3)   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and
at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and
audit of the city’s Municipal Utilities Commission records, new cost figures
will be calculated for use in the above formula. The cost of establishing the
monitoring facilities shall be paid by the unusual user. Based on these audited
figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for
payment by each unusual user, or refund given by the city’s Municipal Utilities
Commission, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the
preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment
will be made as aforesaid.
   (D)   Schedule IV; applicable inside and outside of the corporate limits of
the city. Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the city’s
wastewater collection and/or transmission and/or treatment system by certain
industrial plant or plants cannot be accurately determined by the use of the
plant’s water meter or meters, and said plant cannot install a flow meter to
measure such waste, a special formula will be used whereby such plant or plants
will pay to the city’s Municipal Utilities Commission a sewer charge calculated
at 50 gallons of water per each employee at the plant each working day.
   (E)   Schedule V. Reserved.
   (F)   Schedule VI. The sewer utility is required to collect the utility tax
pursuant to W. Va. Code § 8-13-5(a). Customers receiving sewer service within
the corporate limits of the specified municipality shall pay a surcharge at the
following surcharge rate: municipality utility excise tax of 2% local tax rate.

(Prior Code, § 932.19)
§ 932.20 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT EROSION CONTROL COMPREHENSIVE DRAINAGE PLAN.
   (A)   The requirements and standards of this section shall apply to all new
developments and redevelopment projects, including the disturbance of land
activities of any kind, on any lot, tract, parcel, or land or any portion
thereof. The intent of these regulations is to minimize the discharge and
transport of pollutants to storm drain systems and prevent the deterioration of
water quality.
   (B)   All new construction of new developments or redevelopment projects
within the city watershed shall include a notice of intent, storm water
management plans, and comprehensive drainage plans as described in this
section. These plans shall be subject to the review and approval of the City
Engineer or designated representative and may receive approval from the
Director, the Municipal Utility Commission, and City Council.
   (C)   The following activities shall be exempt from the requirements of this
section, except that no activity shall be exempt from the management of the
discharge of sediment or any other form of water pollution that may leave any
parcel, site, or tract:
      (1)   Agricultural land management activities, as defined in this
article;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family
dwellings of a size less than 1,000 square feet;
      (3)   Activities that result in impervious surface area of less than
3,000 square feet (excluding single-family dwellings) regardless of the ratio
of impervious surface area to total site area; however, a phased contiguous
construction project shall be measured by the size of all planned or
contemplated phases. Each phase shall be required to meet the requirements of
this article; and
      (4)    Any development activities that the “Board” determines are
regulated under specific state laws and which provide for managing storm water
runoff will be exempt from the provision of the article and the requirements of
providing storm water management and erosion control.
   (D)   Technical, administrative, or procedural matters may be modified by
the Director as needed to meet the objectives and policies defined in this
article, so long as such modifications are not contrary to or beyond the intent
of the objectives and policies included in this article.
   (E)   Uniform requirements shall be applied to each regulated project site.
These requirements shall be based upon the criterion that post-development
storm water peak runoff rates of flow must not exceed the pre-development peak
runoff rates of flow. In redevelopment projects, a peak runoff rate of flow
reduction of 10% from the pre-existing peak runoff rate of flow must be
achieved. However, no reduction shall be required beyond the peak runoff rate
of flow that would occur from the parcel in its natural, undeveloped state.
   (F)   For construction that results in impervious areas of 3,000 square feet
and greater (with the exception of single-family residential housing) or, if
the ratio of impervious surface area to total site area is greater than 50%, a
Storm Water Management and Erosion Control Plan will be required in order to
qualify for a storm water permit. The Plan shall include the following
information:
      (1)   Descriptive information:
         (a)   Title block with:
            1.   Development name;

            5.   Failure to provide final as-built drawings within three months
of substantial project completion will cause the utility to prepare these
drawings. The responsible party shall be charged for this service. The Director
may extend this time as deemed necessary.
         (e)   Design standards:
            1.   Flow rates shall be calculated by use of the Rational Method
or SCS TR-55 Method unless sufficient justification for use of another method
is approved by the Director;
            2.   The minimum “time of concentration” to be used in the
calculations shall be six minutes; and
            3.   Detention structures shall be designed in such a manner that
the post-construction peak runoff rate of flow shall be equal to or less than
the pre-construction peak runoff of flow rate for two-year/24-hour and ten-
year/24-hour storms. Additional measures may be considered by the Director in
critical area watersheds. In redevelopment projects, a peak runoff reduction of
10% from the pre- existing peak runoff rate of flow must be achieved; however,
no reduction shall be required beyond the peak runoff rate of flow that would
occur from the parcel in its natural, undeveloped state.
         (f)   Design backup:
            1.   Calculations of volumetric runoff and peak runoff rate of flow
for both pre- development and post-development;

   (G)   All development and/or redevelopment projects shall minimize the
impact to the water environment by applying structural and/or nonstructural
management practices selected to address site- specific conditions.
   (H)   No construction shall be performed in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of construction or in other areas,
regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions, increased
runoff, diminishing channel or floodplain storage capacity, harm to aquatic
life, or any other manifestation of negative impact.
   (I)   New construction or reconstruction shall be permitted only after
temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control management practices have
been placed and are operational to the satisfaction of the Director. The
Director may halt construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement
actions consistent with this article upon a finding of inadequate erosion and
sediment control management practices upon a site or property subject to the
provisions of this article.
   (J)   All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after a 0.25-inch rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control. The owner shall maintain records
of these inspections. The Director may halt construction on properties that do
not provide satisfactory proof of compliance with this requirement.
   (K)   Waivers for providing storm water management include the following.
      (1)   Storm Water Management and Erosion Control Plan waivers shall be
granted by the Director with approval of the Board only to those projects
within areas where Watershed Management Plans have been developed and/or where
the WVDEP, the county, and the city deem appropriate. A written request for
waiver must be submitted to the Director in a form that is provided by the
Municipal Utility Commission.
      (2)   If a comprehensive Watershed Management Plan has not been
developed, then a waiver may be granted to specific projects on a case-by-case
basis that do not increase the post-development peak discharge over that of the
pre-development peak discharge for undisturbed land. The Director, with
approval of the Board, may not waive the minimum for storm water management of
water quality protection as described in division (I) above.
      (3)   Any requirements beyond those described in division (I) above may
be waived by the Director, with approval of the Board, if the Director finds
that meeting the minimum on-site storm water management requirements is not
feasible due to the unique natural or existing physical characteristics of a
site or that the property owner would suffer an undue hardship if required to
meet the full requirements of this regulation. To be eligible for a waiver, the
applicant must also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director and the
Board that the waiver will not result in any of the following impacts to
downstream waterways:
         (a)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         (b)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (c)   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         (d)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and/or
property.
      (4)   Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site storm water
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy storm water management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Director.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Alternative means for on-site management of storm water
discharges that have been established in a storm water management plan that has
been approved by the Director;
         (b)   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed storm
water management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public
or private, that currently lack storm water management facilities. This
alternative facility must provide a level of storm water control that is equal
to or greater than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices
and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term
operation and maintenance of the off-site practice. The Director shall, to the
maximum extent practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site
practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management
practice;
         (c)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the city
or the grant of an easement to the city, to be dedicated to preservation,
reforestation, and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. Any mitigation
measure shall provide a level of environmental protection and/or improvement
that is, in the sole discretion of the Director, approximately equal to or
greater than that which would have been provided by the waived practice; and
         (d)   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental
protection and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Director,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.

§ 1157.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this article is to limit the use of camper and other
nonpermanent structures for permanent human habitation and to regulate
campgrounds because it is the determination of the city that the use of campers
in the city for permanent human habitation is deleterious to the health,
safety, and welfare not only of the persons residing therein but, additionally,
of the public at large. Portable heating devices, nonstandard electrical
connections, and a lack of approved sanitary facilities, all lend themselves to
unhealthful, unsanitary, and hazardous living conditions, if utilized for
extended periods of time, occasioned in part because campers and other
nonpermanent structures are not intended for use as places of permanent human
habitation and do not adequately provide for the needs associated with human
habitation. The purpose of this article is to also promulgate rules that allow
for the safe and sanitary use of campground facilities that balance the health,
safety, and welfare interests of public recreation.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, this article shall make allowance for
safe, comfortable, and sanitary use of campers and other nonpermanent
structures for short term, “temporary use” for human habitation purposes so as
to facilitate enjoyment of camping, hunting, fishing, silviculture, and other
out- of-door pursuits.

include the keeping of necessary records, which fulfill the requirements of the
WVBPH cross-connections and backflow prevention regulations.
   (B)   The owner shall allow his or her property to be inspected for possible
cross-connections and shall follow the provisions of the water purveyor’s
program and the WVBPH Regulations if a cross- connections is permitted.
   (C)   If the water purveyor requires that the public supply be protected by
containment, the owner shall be responsible for water quality beyond the outlet
end of the containment device and should utilize fixture outlet protection for
that purpose. He or she may utilize local public health officials, or personnel
from the water purveyor, or their designated representatives, to assist him or
her in the survey of his or her facilities and to assist him or her in the
selection of proper fixture outlet devices, and the proper installation of
these devices.
(Prior Code, § 1728.04)
§ 1728.05 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Water purveyor.
      (1)   On new installations, the water purveyor will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required. In any case, a minimum of a
dual check valve will be required in any new construction.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the water
purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to
be made. Ordinarily, 30 days will be allowed; however, this time period may be
shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the
device(s) in question.
      (3)   The water purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
regularly tested to ensure satisfactory operation.
      (4)   The water purveyor shall inform the owner by letter of any failure
to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The purveyor will allow an
additional 15 days for the correction. In the event the owner fails to comply
with the necessary correction by the time of the second re-inspection, the
water purveyor will inform the owner by letter that the water service to the
owner’s premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In
the event that the owner informs the water purveyor of extenuating
circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may
be granted by the water purveyor, but in no case will exceed an additional 15
days.
      (5)   If the water purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The purveyor will begin initial premises inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the approval of this
program by the WVBPH. Initial focus will be on high hazard industries and
commercial premises.
      (7)   Requirements of this rule shall be in accordance with all
applicable guidelines contained in the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health
Manual, EW-114, Cross-Connection and Backflow Prevention Manual, 2002.
   (B)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on his or her premises.
      (2)   The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the water
purveyor, shall, at his or her expense, install, maintain, and test, or have
tested, any and all backflow preventers on his or her premises.
      (3)   The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
      (4)   The owner shall inform the purveyor of any proposed or modified
cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is
aware but have not been found by the water purveyor.
      (5)   The owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who
cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional
devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
      (6)   The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by
the water purveyor.
      (7)   The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
water purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (8)   Any owner having a private well or other private water source must
have the approval of the water purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or source is
cross-connected to the water purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-connect may
be denied. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the
service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not
cross-connected to the water purveyor’s system.
      (9)   In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the water purveyor’s side of the back-flow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
      (10)   The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance
with water purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
(Prior Code, § 1728.05)
§ 1728.06 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The water purveyor recognized the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and
will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention devices or double check valve assemblies.
(Prior Code, § 1728.06)
§ 1728.07 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the water purveyor to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the
case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any
existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle
device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event
that no backflow device is present.
(Prior Code, § 1728.07)
§ 1728.08 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (A)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at a minimum
of every 12 months.
   (B)   Periodic testing and inspection shall be performed on backflow
preventers by a State of West Virginia certified tester. This testing will be
done at the owner’s expense.
   (C)   The inspection shall be conducted during regular business hours.
Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional
charges to cover the increased costs to the water purveyor.
   (D)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test shall be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the
repair, the device will be retested at the owner’s expense to ensure correct
operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected
if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In
other situations, a compliance date of not more than 15 days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an
effective means of the owner ensuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires
such continuity.
   (E)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in division (A) above, in cases where there is a history of test
failure and the water purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved,
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by
the owner.
(Prior Code, § 1728.08)
§ 1728.09 RECORDS.
   (A)   The water purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections;
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections;
and
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH.
   (B)   Upon request, the water purveyor will submit records of inspection,
surveys, tests, or corrective actions to the state’s Bureau for Public Health

      REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance, or, if full compliance is
not possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the noncompliance to the
greatest extent feasible.
      START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Although a permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building. (The definition for START OF
CONSTRUCTION is to be used only when calculating the starting time of the six-
month expiration of a permit.)
      STATE COORDINATING OFFICE. The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      STREAM. As defined in W. Va. Code 7-1-3u, any watercourse, whether
natural or human- made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of their
size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of
its volume.
      STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means cumulative flood- related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. See SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. 
         (a)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
         (b)   This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage” as defined herein, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         (c)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT, as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         (d)   For the purpose of this definition, IMPROVEMENT is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
      TOP OF BANK. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of
a stream indicate the TOP OF BANK. In the field, a professional familiar with
fluvial geomorphology should document the TOP OF BANK. When a professional is
not employed, the TOP OF THE BANK will be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
      VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this ordinance. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is
presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is provided.
(Prior Code, § 1731.02)
§ 1731.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (A)   Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of
the city which are subject to the 100-year flood, as shown on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) and described in the flood insurance study (FIS)
prepared for the city by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated
June 16, 2005, or the most recent revision thereof.
   (B)   Description of floodplain areas. The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas.
      (1)   The floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. In the approximated
floodplain area (F4) for which no regulatory floodway is designated, the
regulatory floodway is determined to be the channel of the river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of
the floodplain as measured from the top of the bank of the channel to the
upland limit of the floodplain. The term shall also include floodway areas
identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed in division (E)
below.
      (2)   The floodway fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific 100-year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but which lie
beyond the floodway area. The areas are shown on the floodway map or FIRM.
      (3)   The AE area without floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS, but no floodway has been
delineated.
      (4)   The approximated floodplain area (F4) shall be those areas
identified as an A Zone on the FIRM or floodway map included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state,
or other acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. Only professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications shall undertake hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. The
responsible professional shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computation, and the like used to determine base flood elevations and floodways
as described in division (A) above shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a thorough technical review by the city.
   (C)   Changes in designation of area. The delineation of the identified
floodplain area may be revised by the city where natural or human-made changes
have occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission, or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA). The community may delineate and regulate new approximated area (F4) by
using simplistic methods involving locally derived information, such as flood
of record and topographic data.
   (D)   Elevations prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the base flood elevation
specified in the flood insurance study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in §
1731.06. Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to
apply for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the special flood
hazard area designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the base flood elevation specified in the flood insurance study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this ordinance.
   (E)   Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Board of Appeals of
the city. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Prior Code, § 1731.03)
§ 1731.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (A)   Floodway (F1). Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated, through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice, that the proposed encroachment will not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation. Because floodways present increased risk
to human life and property due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing
waters, the floodway shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below,
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative, the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances, and regulations.
      (4)   In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been
designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
community, be considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land
areas to a distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from
the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100-year
floodplain boundary.
   (B)   Floodway fringe. Within any floodway fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities, and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
   (C)   AE area without floodway (F3). Within any AE without floodway area, no
new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (D)   Approximated floodplain (Zone “A”). Within any approximated floodplain
area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from federal, state, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding;
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all
proposed development to determine the amount being invested and the specific
flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the
applicant to determine the elevation above which the development will be
reasonably safe from flooding using the techniques set forth in the city
Approximate A Zone administrative procedures. When hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of
findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, and the
like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Floodplain Administrator; and
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities, and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances, and regulations.
   (E)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter (including placement of
bridges, culverts, and the like) or relocate a stream within the floodplain
area, the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail, the City of
Milton Floodplain Administrator, the West Virginia State Coordinating Office at
Building 1 Room EB-80, 1900 Kanawha Blvd., Charleston, WV 25305-0360 any
adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which federal or state law requires approval.
Contact information for state and federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate county, state, and federal
government agencies are contained in the city stream alteration administrative
procedures.

      (2)   The developer shall also assure the city in writing that the
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of
findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, and the
like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges, or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts, or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings, and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts, and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses, including culverts, bridges, and other
stream crossing. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
1731.08(C).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the flood
insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
(Prior Code, § 1731.04)
§ 1731.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   General. Building permits are required in order to determine whether
all new construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in the identified floodplain, floodway, or other flood
hazard area;
      (2)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Constructed with material and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage as outlined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 or the most recent revision
thereof;
      (4)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (5)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      (6)   To comply with W. Va. Code 11-3-3a concerning County Assessor
“building or real property improvement notice”; or
      (7)   Approved by the County Health Department for Water and Sewer to
assure facilities are designed or located in compliance with the flood damage
reduction requirements of this ordinance.
   (B)   Basic format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant;
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed construction is
to occur;
      (3)   Name, address, and valid West Virginia license number of all
contractors working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is
being performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing;
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the project,
including tax map and parcel number and most recent deed book and page number;
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the base
flood elevation, and the location of the floodway boundary when applicable;
      (6)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in §
1705.10;
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow authorized
representatives of floodplain management programs access to inspect for
compliance; and
      (8)   The contract required, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall
be presented to the Floodplain Administrator for review within five business
days of contract signing. The community does not require and will not keep
copies of the contracts or addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums
for review shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or
the work is of an aggregate value of less than $10,000 including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (C)   Elevation and flood-proofing information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this ordinance. Depending
on the type of structure involved, the following information shall also be
included in the application for work within the floodplain area.
      (1)   For structures to be elevated to two feet above the base flood
elevation:
         (a)   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
         (b)   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor;
         (c)   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure,
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, and the like. When required by the
Floodplain Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall
prepare these plans;
         (d)   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, and the like) from flooding to two feet
above the base flood elevation at the building site;
         (e)   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made, this is the best time to correct the error;
         (f)   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared
by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications.
The elevation certificate must confirm that the structure in question, together
with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions; and
         (g)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a nonconforming use (generally applies to areas below base flood
elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below base flood elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access, or for allowable storage as
detailed in this ordinance; and
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non- conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature; a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
1731.08.
      (2)   For structures to be flood-proofed to two feet above the base flood
elevation (nonresidential structures only), all applicants are encouraged to
exceed the minimum flood-proofing requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the level of flood-
proofing above the height required by this ordinance. In order to obtain an
“elevation credited” flood insurance on dry flood proof, flood-proofing must
extend at least one foot above the base flood elevation:
         (a)   Plans showing details of all flood-proofing measures, prepared
by a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
         (b)   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood-proofing limits;
certified by a registered professional engineer or a licensed professional
surveyor; and
         (c)   A flood-proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in division (C)(2)(a) above, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the base flood elevation; and
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the base flood.
      (3)   For appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant
materials, used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage (appurtenant
structures only):
         (a)   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground, and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site; and
         (b)   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirms that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities, is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation down and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the base flood elevation;
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade; and
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
            3.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion
agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
1731.08(C).
   (D)   Site plan criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction, and substantial improvements determined to be located in a mapped
floodplain area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. The
proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they
are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. The owner or developer
shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain Administrator that
includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor, or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section;
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lots sites, and fills;
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities, and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas. A registered professional
engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site plan;
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain area and which are greater than ten lots or two acres, whichever is
the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway:
         (a)   When a flood insurance study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the base flood;
         (b)   If a FEMA flood insurance study is not available, the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service, or
State and Water Resource Department; and
         (c)   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the floodplain area and all proposed development including fill will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the approximated
floodplain area (Zone “A”) boundary depicted on the map, development of
detailed base flood elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases, the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
or five feet, depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be
developed and the location of the floodplain boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must
certify the site plan.
   (E)   Restrictions to subdivision of land in floodplain areas. Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than one foot below
the elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. All new structures
must be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of
the identified flood hazard area.
   (F)   Restrictions to development in floodplain areas. The development of
any proposed manufactured home (rental unit) park or other commercial (for
profit and non-profit), institutional, or industrial type development project
shall result in a buildable area outside of the identified flood hazard area.
The buildable area shall have a minimum building setback of 25 feet horizontal
from the limits of the flood hazard area, or two feet vertical above the base
flood elevation, whichever is greater in the horizontal distance from the
limits of the flood hazard area. All new building and structures shall be sited
on the buildable area located outside of the identified flood hazard area.
(Prior Code, § 1731.05)
§ 1731.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS; DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings, structures, and related
utilities and facilities, the following restrictions apply to all development,
subdivision proposals, manufactured home parks, new construction, and to
construction of substantial improvements to existing structures occurring in
the floodplain area.
   (A)   Basements and lowest floors.
      (1)   Residential structures. All new construction, relocation, and
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork, and utilities, elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures. All new construction, relocation, and
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork, and utilities, elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation;
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so
that the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet below the base
flood elevation.
      (3)   Openings. For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair or substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
      (4)   Non-conversion agreement. A non-conversion agreement shall be
signed by the applicant on all flood-proofed structures and any elevated
structures when the community determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement
shall state:
         (a)   The area below base flood elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access, or for allowable storage as
detailed in the ordinance; and
         (b)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth §
1731.08(C).
   (B)   Manufactured home placement. Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of
substantial damage to property, therefore:
      (1)   All manufactured homes to be sited within the identified flood
hazard area shall be installed by a contractor possessing a valid West Virginia
Manufactured Home Installer’s License. The installer shall use an installation
design engineered to withstand flood hazards specific to the particular home
site. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within the
flood hazard areas shall be installed in accordance with the following
standards:
         (a)   The lowest floor, ductwork, and utilities including HVAC/heat
pump shall be elevated two feet above the base flood elevation;
         (b)   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation
or shall use other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength
engineered for use in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating
dry stacked block piers shall not be used in flood hazard areas;
         (c)   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, §§ 10.1, 10.2, and 10b as
authorized by W. Va. Code 21-9-4 or the most recent revisions thereof. The
anchoring shall be adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, the over-the-top and
frame ties, attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not
be adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement
is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces;
         (d)   Permanently attached rigid skirts and/or perimeter wall skirts
of brick or block must have openings to prevent collapse and damage to
supporting piers. The openings must be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of flood waters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
         (e)   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored
and vented.
      (2)   The licensed West Virginia Manufactured Home Installer placing the
unit shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the
manufactured home has been installed to the standards set forth in the
ordinance.
   (C)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   Where feasible, appurtenant structures and detached garages shall
be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet above the base
flood elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the base flood elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         (a)   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000;
         (b)   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side;
         (c)   Structures shall be located, oriented, and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
         (d)   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
         (e)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from two
feet above the base flood elevation down;
         (f)   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the base flood elevation; and
         (g)   The venting requirements contained in division (A) above are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A nonconversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature; a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
1731.08(C).
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices and has no
permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (E)   Fill. The city officially recognizes the beneficial functions the
floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods,
therefore:
      (1)   Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should
be minimized;
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway;
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the floodplain shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill; and
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of §
1731.04. All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the
following standards.
         (a)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The city may require the applicant to
demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill will not adversely
affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the city. During permit review,
the community shall consider the following issues that have the potential to
cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights;
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property;
            3.   Deflection of flood waters onto adjacent existing structures;
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion; and
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required below. For nonresidential structures, fill shall be placed to
provide access acceptable for intended use. At grade access, with fill
extending laterally 15 feet beyond the building line shall be provided to a
minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         (e)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted. No trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         (f)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring, or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         (g)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (h)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         (i)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area must
obtain a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished, the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a letter of map revision
based on fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         (j)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations, or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of flood water.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow;
and
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those adjoining structures
or development.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including streams crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, and storage tanks
located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection, and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
for this division (H).
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the flood
protection setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the flood
protection setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front, and back lot line setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life, shall be stored
below base flood elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles “fill”
material shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this
division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems, whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within Zones AH and AO to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Backflow prevention valves shall be used for all
enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.
(Prior Code, § 1731.06)

approval shall be made, in writing, on the forms supplied by the city, and
shall include all information stipulated under §
1731.05.
   (D)   Changes. After the issuance of a permit or site plan approval by the
Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
application, permit, or any of the plans, specifications, or other documents
submitted with the application without the written consent or approval of the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (E)   Permit placards. The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit
placard, which shall be prominently displayed on the premises during the time
construction is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the building
permit, the date of its issuance, and be signed by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (F)   Start of construction. Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. All work on the proposed development must be completed within 18
months of permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a time
extension is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The request
for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the
extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the developer diligently pursed the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months; and
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,

written violation notice. The violation notice shall specify the nature of the
violation and request that the violation be corrected within 15 days from the
date appearing on the notice.
         (b)   Failure to correct the violation within this time period shall
be cause for revocation of the permit and the governing body, or authorized
employee or agent to:
            1.   Seek an injunction in the County Circuit Court to restrain the
violator from continuing the violation, including, but not limited to, requests
for the removal of structures or land uses from the property involved; and
            2.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in Magistrate Court or Circuit

public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         (b)   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         (c)   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed

         (d)   The Appeals Authority shall notify the applicant in writing over
the signature of a community official that the issuance of a decision to allow
construction of a structure below the base flood elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, such construction below the base
flood elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications shall

requirements or provisions of this ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the community shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions
are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement
of this ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
non-compliance with, this ordinance shall not excuse the violation or
noncompliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered,
or relocated in non-compliance with this ordinance may be declared by the city

§ 1737.01 PURPOSE.
   This article is enacted to remedy nuisance activities that repeatedly occur
or exist at chronic nuisance properties by providing a process for abatement;
and this remedy is not an exclusive remedy available under any state or local
laws and may be used in conjunction with such other laws. Specifically, it is
recognized that W. Va. Code 8-12-5(23) permits municipalities to “provide for
the elimination of hazards to public health and safety and to abate or cause to
be abated anything which in the opinion of a majority of the governing body is
a public nuisance”. Thus, it is further recognized that the city is currently
empowered to abate public nuisances without the necessity of litigation. The
right to abate public nuisances through action of the governing body is
expressly reserved.

repeated nuisance activities at the property; or
      (4)   Property on which continuous or repeated nuisance activities exist
or have occurred.

determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property with a concise
description of the nuisance activities leading to his or her determination;
      (3)   Demand that the property owner responds within ten days to the
Chief of Police and/or his or her designee a course of action that the Chief of
Police and/or his or her designee agrees abate the nuisance activities giving
violation; and
      (4)   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the property owner at
the address of the property determined to be a chronic nuisance property as
well as the address shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property
is located, or such other place which is likely to give the property owner
notice of the determination by the Chief of Police and/or his or her designee.
   (C)   If the property owner fails to respond as required in this article,
the Chief of Police may refer this matter to the City Attorney. Prior to

nuisance activities have occurred or are occurring. This division (E) does not
require the exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered
for any other purpose.
   (F)   The failure of any property owner to receive notice as provided shall
not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this article.

affected in violation of any federal, state, or local fair housing, human
rights, or antidiscrimination laws.
