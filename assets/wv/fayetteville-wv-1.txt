EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

records to document the competition obtained shall be maintained.
   (b)   Non-Competitive Procurement.
      (1)   General. Procurement may be made or a contract awarded without
competition when a department head determines, and the Town Manager concurs in
writing, and it is not otherwise required by law, after conducting a good faith
review of available sources, that the contract or procurement by its very
nature is not suitable to competitive bids or proposals. Examples of
procurement or contracts which may not be suitable for competitive bids or
proposals include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:

section, the Town Council or Manager may make emergency procurement of
supplies, equipment, services or construction items when there exists a threat
to public health, welfare or safety, or to prevent or minimize serious
disruption of government services or operations; provided, that such emergency
procurements shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the
circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for
the selection of the particular contractor or vendor shall be made and
maintained. A confirming resolution which includes such written determination
shall be considered by the Town Council at any meeting thereof immediately
following such emergency action for all emergency procurements or contracts of
$10,000 or more.

Town may enter into contracts with the United States of America, the State of
West Virginia, or with any department, division or agency thereof, for the
purpose of accepting gifts and for the purchase, sale, exchange, lease, or
transfer of any equipment, supplies, materials, or other property for cash,
credit or other property, with or without warranty, and upon such other terms

135.03 CHIEF OF POLICE.
   The Chief of Police, subject to the statutory authority of the Mayor, shall

to be dealt with according to law. He and his sureties shall be liable to all
the fines, penalties and forfeitures which a constable of a district is liable
to, for any failure or dereliction in such office, to be recovered in the same
manner and in the same courts in which such fines, penalties and forfeitures
are recovered against a constable.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police and each police officer to
aid in the enforcement of the criminal laws of the State within the Town,
independently of any provision of the Codified Ordinances or other ordinance or
lack of an ordinance with respect thereto, and to cause the arrest of or arrest
any offender. Failure on the part of each officer to discharge any duty imposed
by the provisions of this section shall be deemed official misconduct for which

to execute a warrant and the same authority to arrest without a warrant for
offenses committed in his presence, as a constable. (1973 Code §20-5)

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who

agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

notice, the identified owner of the motor vehicle is liable and responsible for

the identified owner of the motor vehicle of any liability for charges for

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OR NEGLECT OF MINOR.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99  and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;

all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not

      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.

   (b)   If any person liable for any tax under Sections
763.03 or

sections, except in those instances in which another measure of the tax is
expressly provided. Council shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for
ascertaining such value.
   (c)   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale,
Council shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining the value

the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character where no common interest exists between the buyer and seller but the
circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   (d)   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections

by other taxpayers, which rules the Town Council shall prescribe.

   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within this Town in the
business of producing for sale, profit or commercial use any natural resource
products, the amount of such tax shall be equal to the value of the article
produced as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the

follows: coal, one percent (1%); limestone or sandstone, quarried or mined, one
and fifty one-hundredths percent (1.50 %); oil, three percent (3%); natural
gas, in excess of the value of five thousand dollars ($5.000), six percent
(6%); blast furnace slag, three percent (3%); sand, gravel or mineral product,
not quarried or mined, three percent (3%); timber, one and fifty one-hundredths
percent (1.50%); other natural resource products, two percent (2%). The measure
of this tax is the value of the entire production in this Town regardless of
the place of sale or the fact that the delivery may be made to points outside
the Town.

corporate limits of this Town, the seller shall refer the question to the
official of this Town charged with the responsibility of collecting taxes due

the sidewalk or driveway entrance so out of repair, if he is a resident, or
upon his agent if he is a nonresident, requiring the owner to repair or
rebuild, where necessary, any such sidewalk or driveway entrance within a time
stated in the notice. In the event of the failure of the property owner, or his

specified time, the Town Manager may have such work done and may assess the
cost thereof against the abutting landowner and the amount thereof may be
collected by the Treasurer by distress and sale, or otherwise as provided by
law for the collection of taxes, and he shall offer the assessment to be
docketed in the office of the Clerk of the County Court as a lien against the
property in the same manner as an original sidewalk assessment; provided, that
where a dangerous condition exists in such sidewalk or driveway, the property
owner shall be required to begin such repair or rebuilding within ten days from
the receipt of such notice.

   All persons operating public utilities in the Town under franchises granted
by the Town and having the right, either by general or special permission, to
enter upon streets and open and excavate pavements or sidewalks or disturb the
surface thereof by excavation or other work shall not be required to apply for
a permit, but shall be required to perform the work and bring it to completion
as promptly as practicable, and to that end shall employ an adequate standing

other requirements of this article, including the surety bond requirements.
(1973 Code §22-9)
909.02 WORK REQUIRING EXCAVATION PERMIT.
   No person shall dig up, excavate, tunnel, undermine or in any manner break

excavation permit therefor from the Town Manager as provided in this article.
(1973 Code §22-10; Passed 5-4-23.)
909.03 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   No excavation permit shall be issued unless a written application therefor
is submitted to the Town Manager. The written application shall state the name
and address of the applicant; the nature, location and purpose of the
excavation; the date of the commencement and date of completion of the
excavation; and other data as may reasonably be required by the Town Manager.
The application shall be accompanied by plans showing the extent of the
proposed excavation work, the dimensions and elevations of both the existing
ground prior to the excavation and of the proposed excavated surfaces, the
location of the excavation work and such other information as may be required
by the Town Manager.
(1973 Code §22-11; Passed 5-4-23.)
909.04 BACKFILLING AND RESTORATION OF SURFACE.
   (a)   Backfilling in any street, sidewalk or public place opened or
excavated pursuant to an excavation permit issued under this article shall be
compacted to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the
excavation was made. Compacting shall be done by mechanical tappers or
vibrators, by rolling layers, or by water settling as required by the soil in
question and sound engineering practices generally recognized in the
construction industry. The decision as to whether a trench shall be backfilled
by water settling shall be based upon such engineering practices and shall be
made by the Town Manager or his representative.
   (b)   Persons permitted to perform work under this article shall restore the
surface of all streets, sidewalks and public places broken or damaged as a
result of the excavation work, to its original condition in accordance with the
specifications of the Town Manager.
(1973 Code §22-12; Passed 5-4-23.)
909.05 WARNING LIGHTS, BARRICADES AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.
   Permits granted under this article shall state what, if any, safety
barriers, lights, warning signs or other safety precautions shall be required
of permittees and no permittee shall fail to comply with the requirements
thereof; provided, that in any case, each permittee shall cause two red lights
to be securely and conspicuously posted, one at each end of the excavation for
which his permit has been issued, and if such excavation exceeds twenty-five
feet in length, then there shall be an additional light for each additional
twenty-five feet or fraction thereof. Such lights shall be kept burning from
sunset to sunrise.
(1973 Code §22-13)
909.06 MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   This article shall not be construed as imposing upon the Town or any
official or employee thereof any liability or responsibility for damages to any
person or property injured by the performance of any excavation work for which
an excavation permit is issued hereunder; nor shall the Town or any official or
employee of the Town be deemed to have assumed any such liability or
responsibility by reason of inspections authorized by the Town, the issuance of
any permit or the approval of any excavation work.
(1973 Code §22-14)
909.07 SURETY BOND OR CASH DEPOSIT.
   (a)   Before an excavation permit is issued pursuant to this article, the
applicant therefor shall file with the Recorder a surety bond, in such amount
not less than $100.00 payable to the Town; provided, that utility companies
within the meaning of Section
909.01 shall give bond in an amount not less than $500.00. The required surety
bond shall be:
      (1)   With good and sufficient surety.
      (2)   By a surety company authorized to transact business in the State.
      (3)   Satisfactory to the Town Attorney in form and substance.
      (4)   Conditioned upon the permittee’s compliance with this article and
to secure and hold the Town and its officers harmless against any and all
claims, judgments, decrees or other costs arising from the excavation and other
work covered by the excavation permit or for which the Town, the Town Council,
or any Town officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to
persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly
guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence
of the permittee, and further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good
and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the
satisfaction of the Town Manager, all openings and excavations made in streets,
sidewalks and public places, and to maintain any street, sidewalk or public
place where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of twenty-
four months after such work was done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was
before such work was done. Any settlement of the surface within such one year
period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the
permittee. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee
to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the Town if such repairs should
prove defective.
   (b)   Recovery on such bonds for any injury or accident shall not exhaust
the bond but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or
injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any
suit or claim against the Town by reason of the negligence or default of the
permittee, upon the Town giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or
claim, any final judgment against the Town requiring it to pay for such damage
shall be conclusive upon the permittee and his surety. An annual bond may be
given under this section which shall remain in force for one year, conditioned
as stated herein in the amount specified herein and in other respects as
specified herein but applicable as to all excavation work in streets, sidewalks
and public places by the principal in such bond during the term of one year
from such date.
   (c)   In lieu of a surety bond as herein provided, and except in the case of
any public utility company, the Town Manager may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, require the applicant to deposit with the Treasurer a sum
sufficient to cover the estimated cost of backfilling and restoration of the
surface, which deposit shall be refunded to the permittee if restoration work
done by him is satisfactory to the Town Manager.

   The purpose of the Scenic Overlay District is to preserve and protect the
scenic viewsheds of the New River Gorge National River. The overlay will
provide for a buffer between private property and the National Park Service
property by limiting development and tree removal. The overlay will also

boundary of the New River Gorge National Park. The boundary shall be the edge
of lands that are owned by the National Park Service. Within the first one
hundred (100) feet of the boundary of the New River Gorge National Park, no new
development shall occur. Between one hundred (100) feet and two hundred (200)
feet of the boundary of the New River Gorge National Park, all development is
limited by the provisions of
this Article.
   Where conflict exists between the provisions of the Scenic Overly District
and the underlying zoning district, the more stringent requirements shall
apply. Only land within the setbacks indicated on the zoning map, as measured
from the boundary of the New River Gorge National Park, is considered the
Scenic Overlay District regulated by this Article.

(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1321.03 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS, USES, AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)    All accessory buildings, uses, and structures shall require a Zoning
Permit. Accessory buildings, accessory uses, and accessory structures shall be
permitted in all districts, provided each is customarily incidental and
subordinate to the principal use. A principal structure or use must be
established on the lot prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit for an
accessory structure.
   (b)    No use conducted in an accessory building or structure shall be in
violation of the permitted uses in that district.
   (c)    All permanent accessory buildings, uses, and structures shall comply
with side setback requirements for the district and may be located only in rear
yards. All permanent accessory buildings, uses, and structures shall be setback
from the rear lot line by ten (10) feet.
   (d)    No accessory buildings, uses, or structures shall be more than
seventy-five (75) percent of the height of the principal structure and in no
circumstances be higher than the applicable zoning district’s maximum height
requirement.
   (e)    Accessory buildings and structures shall not be larger than the
principal structure. Accessory buildings and structures are included in the
maximum lot coverage percentage allowed per lot.
   (f)    No accessory structure shall be constructed and used as a dwelling,
except garage apartments and one residential unit for a caretaker may be
permitted in conjunction with any active industrial establishment or in
conjunction with a place of worship or religious institution.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1321.05  ADDITIONAL PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS.
   (a)    Residential.
      (1)   Individual lots or subdivided parcels ten (10) acres or less in
size shall have no building or buildings used for living purposes in addition
to the principal building on the same lot, except garage apartments where
permitted in a zoning district. Such garage apartments may only be occupied by
persons employed on the premises.
      (2)   Undivided land parcels of ten (10) acres or greater in size shall
be limited to one (1) residential structure per ten (10) acre unit of undivided
land area. This provision does not apply to factory-built home rental
communities.
   (b)    Nonresidential. More than one principal building may be located upon
the lot or tract of nonresidential properties, such as a caretaker’s residence
used in conjunction with an active industrial establishment, lodging
establishment, or campground, but only when such buildings conform to all
setback requirements. Additional principal buildings may include a caretaker’s
residence used in conjunction with an active industrial establishment or a
caretaker’s residence used in conjunction with a place of worship or religious
institution.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1321.07 CLEAR SIGHT TRIANGLE.
   In a clear sight triangle, the entire area shall remain clear of
obstructions to sight, including but not limited to fences, hedges, other
landscaping, and signs, above a plane established two and one-half (2.5) feet
in elevation to a height of eight (8) feet from grade level at the intersection
of any street, alley, or other public right-of-way centerline.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1321.09  FENCING, WALLS, AND HEDGES.
   Subject to the following conditions, fences and walls may be erected, and
hedges and other plantings may be grown along the boundaries of a lot:
   (a)    Clear Sight Triangle. Fences, hedges, other plantings, or walls at
street corners shall not interfere with any clear sight triangle. The height of
such objects is restricted to two and one-half (2.5) feet within the clear
sight triangle. No fence, hedge, other plantings, or walls shall otherwise
impose a threat to the public safety, including by obstructing the view of
motorists to oncoming traffic or pedestrians.
   (b)    Height Restrictions. Fences, walls, hedges, and other plantings used
for the purpose of screening shall not exceed four (4) feet in height from the
front building line of the main structure extending to the front lot line, and
shall not exceed six (6) feet in height extending behind the front building
line of the main structure, excluding porches, stairs, and trees.
   (c)    Fences and Walls.
      (1)   Fences and walls shall be durably constructed and well maintained.
      (2)   Fences and walls that have deteriorated shall be replaced or
removed immediately.
      (3)   Fence and walls shall not be constructed out of fabric, junk, junk
vehicles, appliances, tanks, barrels, razor wire, barbed wire, or electric
fencing.
      (4)   The finished side of the fence shall be oriented towards the front
of the lot or the direction of the adjacent property owner, unless the fence is
not visible from adjoining property.
   (d)    Landscaped Buffer Areas.
      (1)   The use of a ten (10) foot landscaped buffer area of screen
plantings shall remain the preferred method of buffering. However, where a
buffer strip is considered to be impracticable or inappropriate, an opaque
fence at least six (6) feet in height, in the rear or side yard, or four (4)
feet in the front yard so as to restrict a clear view beyond said buffer yard
may be substituted in whole or in part for a natural buffer, provided the
fence’s specifications are approved by the Zoning Officer.
      (2)   Landscaped buffer areas must be continually maintained by the
landowner. Any plant material that does not survive shall be replaced within
six (6) months. All landscaping shall be kept free of refuse and debris.
      (3)   Landscaped buffer areas may be required by the Board of Zoning
Appeals as a condition of a conditional use permit.
      (4)   At least fifty (50) percent of the screen planting specimens shall
be evergreens, distributed evenly along the length of the barrier.
      (5)   All species within the screen planting shall be indigenous or
otherwise well-suited to the town, except that trees with large leaves which
could clog storm drains and trees that are brittle; are disease-prone; have
low, spreading branches or shallow root systems; drop large fruit or much sap;
or are otherwise messy, shall be avoided.
      (6)   Hedges shall be kept trimmed so that branches do not extend into
public roads, or upon the lands of an adjoining owner more than eighteen (18)
inches over the dividing line.
      (7)   A screen planting shall not be required where the lot abuts an area

reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this Ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution
of obscene material.

the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Town
Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
      (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm, which the Town has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the Town's rationale for this Ordinance, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the Town's interests in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extend to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the Town. The Town finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this Ordinance are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (c)    In the event that an activity or business which might fall under a
use category other than adult business is combined with or includes activities

      (Passed 7-7-22.)
   1324.05  APPLICABILITY.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities may not be constructed or modified
without a zoning permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this
Article. Modifications to existing wireless telecommunication facilities, as of
the effective date of this Article, are required to comply with this Article.
   This Section does not apply to the replacement of any component of a
wireless telecommunication facility where the replacement is identical to the
component being replaced or to the normal repair and maintenance of a wireless
telecommunication facility that does not involve the addition, removal, or
change of any of the externally discernable physical components of a wireless
telecommunication facility from that which was originally permitted.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1324.07  SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE CRITERIA.
   For the purposes of determining whether a requested modification is an
eligible facilities request for modification under this Section, a proposed
facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimensions of an
eligible support structure, and therefore not be eligible for the expedited
modification process and corresponding eligible facilities application process
under this Article, if the requested modification meets any of the following
criteria:
   (a)    For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the
requested increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or
by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by
more than ten percent (10%) or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is greater.
   (b)    Changes in height shall be measured from the original support
structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally,
such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height shall
be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of
originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved
prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.
   (c)    For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, it involves
adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the
edge of the tower more than twenty (20) feet, or more than the width of the
tower structure at the level of appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other
eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of
the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than
six (6) feet.
   (d)    For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more
than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved,
but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public right-of-way
and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on
the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than
ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure.
   (e)    It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site.
   (f)    It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure.
   (g)    It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting
approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure
or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not
apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not
exceed the thresholds identified in this section.
      (Passed 7-7-22.)
   1324.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Lighting. Lighting affixed to any wireless telecommunication
facilities shall meet, but not exceed, the minimum lighting required by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For any application where lighting is
required, the applicant shall submit documentation from the FAA stating that
the proposed lighting meets all applicable FAA standards and regulations.
   (b)    Structural Standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall
conform to the most current versions of the ANSI/ASSE A10.48 “Standard Criteria
for Safety Practices with the Construction, Demolition, Modification and
Maintenance of Communication Structures”; ANSI/TIA-222 Standard, “Structural
Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small Wind Turbine
Support Structures”; and ANSI/TIA-322 Standard, “Loading, Analysis and Design
Criteria Related to the Installation, Alteration and Maintenance of
Communication Structures.” Wireless telecommunication facilities shall also
meet any applicable local building code standards.
   (c)    Height Restrictions. No wireless telecommunication facility shall
exceed one hundred ninety-nine (199) feet in height, unless the applicant
sufficiently justifies that the height of the tower will eliminate other
similar towers or that the provision of service cannot be accomplished without
a tower height in excess of one hundred ninety-nine (199) feet. Any applicant
proposing a wireless telecommunication facility greater than one hundred
ninety-nine (199) feet in height must provide evidence that the applicant
notified the FAA of the intent to build the facility and received a final
determination of “no hazard” from the FAA. Wireless telecommunications
facilities located atop or within an alternative support structure may extend
ten percent (10%) above the height of the structure or to the maximum height
permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located, whichever
is less.
   (d)    Collocation.
      (1)   An applicant for a new wireless telecommunication facility must
demonstrate by substantial evidence that a bona fide need exists for the
construction of a new tower and that no reasonable combination of locations,
techniques, or technologies would obviate the need. The applicant for a new
facility must further demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been made to
collocate wireless telecommunication facilities on existing towers or
alternative support structures.
      (2)   Prior to the approval of an application for a wireless
telecommunications facility, the applicant shall demonstrate commitment to
joint use as follows:
         A.   The applicant shall submit evidence as part of the application
demonstrating that a genuine effort has been made to solicit additional users
for the proposed new wireless telecommunications facility. Evidence of this
shall include, at a minimum, copies of notices sent by registered mail, return
receipt requested, to all other providers of cellular and wireless
telecommunications services within the same county and within adjacent
counties, or a Class II legal advertisement, advising of the intent to
construct a new tower, identifying the location, inviting the joint use and
sharing of costs, and requesting a written response within fifteen (15)
business days.
         B.   As part of the application, the applicant shall attest that the
company will encourage the joint use of telecommunications towers within the
Town of Fayetteville, committing that there shall be no unreasonable act or
omission that would have the effect of excluding, obstructing, or delaying
joint use of any tower where fair and just market reasonable compensation is
offered for such use.
         C.   Wireless telecommunications facilities, other than alternative
support structures, shall be designed and built to accommodate a minimum of
three (3) wireless telecommunications provider’s equipment. The owner of the
tower, if different than the applicant, must certify to the Town of
Fayetteville that the tower is available for use by other telecommunications
service providers on a reasonable and non-discriminatory basis.
   (e)    Concealment.
      (1)   All new or modified wireless telecommunication facilities must be
concealed in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the facilities
through careful design, siting, landscaping, screening, and innovative
camouflaging and stealth techniques, unless applicant shows by substantial
evidence that to do so is impracticable.
      (2)   Concealment techniques include artificial trees, parapet
extensions, silos, chimneys, water towers, fiberglass flagpoles, clock towers,
and existing steeples.
      (3)   A description must be included in the application of the
possibilities for concealment that have been explored, and why the proposed
option was chosen.
      (4)   Visual impact analysis of the wireless telecommunication facility
is required using existing information, predictive modeling techniques,
photographs, and simulations, to accurately and impartially communicate the
potential visual impacts from proposed project.
      (5)   If determined to be impracticable by Zoning Officer for a tower or
alternative support structure to be entirely concealed, the applicant will
describe how they will utilize materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping to blend facilities into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings to the greatest extent practicable.
      (6)   If an antenna is installed on an alternative support structure, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral
color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the
alternative support structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment
as visually unobtrusive as possible.
      (7)   Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view
or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or
placed underground
      (8)   Replacement or modification of any previously approved concealed
tower or facility must substantially conform to previous design
characteristics.
   (f)    Setback. Each tower shall have a setback of at least one hundred and
ten percent (110%) the tower height measured from the tower base to the nearest
property line.
‘
   (g)    Collapse Zone. No habitable structure may be located within the
proposed collapse zone. The applicant shall demonstrate that the entire
collapse zone is either under lease or owned by the applicant and that no
habitable structure will be constructed in the collapse zone while the tower is
standing.
   (h)    Equipment Cabinets. No equipment cabinet for a wireless
telecommunications facility shall exceed seven hundred fifty (750) square feet
in area, nor twelve (12) feet in height. All equipment cabinets shall be
located with the tower and shall be enclosed within a minimum of a six (6) foot
security fence and a locked gate.
   (i)    Signs. No commercial messages nor any other signs beyond that which
is required, not to exceed twelve (12) square feet cumulatively, shall be
placed on any tower, equipment cabinet, or security fence.
   (j)    Landscaping.
      (1)   Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible. Trees existing within one hundred
(100) feet of the wireless telecommunications facility shall not be removed
except as required for tower construction, security fence construction,
installation of ingress or egress, and the installation of utilities to the
facility. To the extent that existing vegetation is the basis for a waiver of
the landscaping requirement, preservation of such vegetation shall be a
condition of the permit, and if such existing vegetation is removed or
destroyed, the applicant shall meet the landscaping specified in subsection (j)
(2) below within six (6) months thereafter.
      (2)   Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be landscaped within
six (6) months after the tower and base station are erected with a visual
buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the equipment
cabinet from adjacent property. The standard visual buffer shall consist of a
landscaped strip of at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the
security fencing enclosing the facilities. The visual buffer shall include
vegetation of at least eight (8) feet tall, planted ten (10) feet apart behind
a contiguous hedge of shrubs three (3) feet deep. All plant materials shall be
species native to West Virginia. In the case where the tower and base station
are sited on large wooded lots, the applicant may request that the natural
growth preserved around the tower site be considered a sufficient visual
barrier, without the need for additional landscaping. Such a request shall
accompany the application and shall include photographs of the natural growth
to be preserved.
   (k)    Location of Towers or Antenna in or near Historic Sites, Historic
Districts, and Designated Scenic Resources. Applications for wireless
telecommunications facilities or antennas subject to this Section shall also
demonstrate that the views of, and vistas from, such structures, districts, and
resources shall not be impaired or diminished by the placement of the proposed
tower or antennas. In no instance shall a wireless telecommunications facility
subject to the provisions of this paragraph exceed one hundred and ninety-nine
(199) feet in height.
   (l)   Site Demarcation. The site shall be physically and visually marked in
the field, for immediate identification, with any combination of survey irons
or flags as needed during the application process or during construction.

ARTICLE 1325
Sign Regulations
1325.01    Findings, purpose and intent; interpretation.
1325.03    Permit required.
1325.05    Permit not required.
1325.07    Prohibited signs.
1325.09    General requirements.
1325.11    Nonconforming signs.
1325.13    Maintenance and removal.
1325.15    Temporary signs.
1325.17    Sign regulations by district.
   1325.01  FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (a)    Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values; preservation of the character of the various neighborhoods; creation of
a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this
article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which
can be given effect without the invalid provision.
   (b)    Signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by
conditional use permit under this article, by specific requirements in another
portion of this ordinance, or otherwise expressly allowed by the Town Council
or Board of Zoning Appeals are forbidden.
   (c)    These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant and the landscape
and architecture of surrounding buildings, and to ensure that signs are legible
and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to
motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and
attractive condition.
   (d)    These regulations distinguish between portions of the Town designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the Town designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (e)    These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the
Town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are
most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.
   (f)    These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may
be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1325.03  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)    Application for Permit. Except as provided in this code, a sign
permit is required prior to the display and erection of any sign.
      (1)   An application for a sign permit shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer on forms furnished by the Town of Fayetteville. The applicant shall
provide sufficient information to determine if the proposed sign is permitted
under the zoning ordinance and other applicable laws, regulations, and
ordinances. An application for a temporary sign shall state the dates intended
for the erection and removal of the sign. An application for an electronic
message display shall include the manufacturer’s statement that the sign has
been pre-programmed, to the extent possible, to conform to the requirements of
this code. Such manufacturer’s statement shall include, where applicable, the
pre-stacked sign settings relating to text and graphic features, message change
features, message change time intervals, day and night lighting requirements,
and any other settings capable of limiting the electronic message display such
that it conforms to this code.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall promptly process the sign permit
application and approve the application, reject the application, or notify the
applicant of deficiencies in the application within twenty (20) business days
after receipt. Any application that complies with all provisions of this zoning
ordinance, the building code, and other applicable laws, regulations, and
ordinances shall be approved.
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Town shall provide a list of
the reasons for the rejection in writing. An application shall be rejected for
non-compliance with the terms of the zoning ordinance, building code, or other
applicable law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (b)    Permit Fee. A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all sign permit
applications. The permit fee shall be set by Town Council.
   (c)    Duration and Revocation of Permit. If a sign is not installed within
six (6) months following the issuance of a sign permit or the time period
stated within the permit, or within thirty (30) days in the case of a temporary
sign permit, the permit shall be void. The permit for a temporary sign shall
state its duration. The Town may revoke a sign permit under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The Town determines that information in the application was
materially false or misleading;
      (2)   The sign as installed does not conform to the sign permit
application; or
      (3)   The sign violates the zoning ordinance, building code, or other
applicable law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (d)    All signs shall be removed within thirty (30) days of the earliest of
expiration of the sign permit or vacation of the premises by the occupant.
   (e)    Appeals from the denial or granting of a sign permit shall be made to
the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the process set out in this code.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1325.05 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.

maximum sign square footage for a particular use or particular property.
      (Passed 7-7-22.)
   1325.07 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   The purpose of prohibiting the following signage is to address the Town’s
substantial public safety and welfare concerns, including aesthetic concerns

   1325.09  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Setback and Placement. Except as otherwise permitted, all
freestanding signs and flagpoles shall be set back from any public right-of-way
at least half the height of the sign or flagpole. Electronic message displays
shall be placed perpendicular to residential structures where possible and
shall comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, including the
avoidance of harmful interference with radio frequencies.
   (b)    Illumination. The purpose of the following provisions regulating
signage lighting is to ensure that signs are lighted in such a manner as to
maintain aesthetic consistency with signs already existing in the Town and to
ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians, while also ensuring that signs
are adequately able to convey sign messages.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   “Candela” means the basic unit of measurement of light in SI
(metric) units.
         B.   “Candela per square meter (cd/m²)” means the SI (metric) unit
used to describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface
that reflects light. Also referred to as Nits.
         C.   “Nit” means a photometric unit of measurement referring to
luminance. One nit is equal to one cd/m².
         D.   “SI (International System of Units)” means the modern metric
system of measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term “Le Systeme
International d’Unites.”
      (2)   A sign in any district may be illuminated at night. Signs that are
illuminated at night may not exceed a maximum luminance level of seven hundred
and fifty (750) cd/m² or Nits, regardless of the method of illumination, at
least one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, as determined by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US Department of Commerce, for
the specific geographic location and date. All illuminated signs must comply
with this maximum luminance level throughout the night, if the sign is
energized, until Apparent Sunrise, as determined by the NOAA, at which time the
sign may resume luminance levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (3)   The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between Apparent
Sunrise and one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, shall be ten thousand
(10,000) cd/m² or Nits.
      (4)   All permitted and conditional use signs may be backlit, internally
lighted, or indirectly lighted, subject to lighting limitations in this code.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.
      (5)   Temporary signs shall not be lighted.
   (c)    Signs shall be of quality design, construction, color, and materials
consistent with the design of the building and development. This includes
glass, masonry, wood, natural stone, ornamental metalwork, and ceramics. Paint
and metal gilt work are also acceptable. Signs painted on cloth awnings are
permissible. Signs must be constructed of durable materials.
   (d)    Maximum Height Measurements. Wall signs and other signs with sign
structures not affixed to the ground are measured from the lowest attached
component of the sign to the highest attached component of the sign. The
maximum height for signs with sign structures affixed to the ground is measured
as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign, subject to limitations in this article.
Normal grade is the lower of:
      (1)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.
   (e)    Measurement of Sign Area. Sign area is calculated under the following
principles:
      (1)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
      (2)   The permitted area of a double-faced a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.
      (3)   For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)   Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.
      (5)   In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a
property or in a building, allowable sign area not exceed twelve (12) square
feet per tenant or the total sign area allowed per use per tenant, whichever is
less.
      (6)   Wall signs. Wall signs are not counted towards the maximum sign
area permitted per use.
         A.   Wall signs larger than fifty (50) square feet shall provide as
part of zoning permit application:
            1.   Express permission from the operator and owner of the
building;
            2.   The name and address of the person applying the wall sign;
            3.   A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions
and location.
         B.   Wall signs larger than one hundred (100) square feet are subject
to the design review standard in subsection (f).
   (f)    Design review standards for wall signs in excess of one hundred (100)
square feet. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue permits for signs subject
to design review in accordance with Section
1325.03, except that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue a determination
within forty (40) business days. In determining whether a sign is compatible
with the theme and overall character to be achieved in each zoning district,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its compatibility determination on the
following criteria:
      (1)   The relationship of the scale and placement of the sign to the
building or premises on which it is to be displayed.
      (2)   The relationship of the colors of the sign to the colors of
adjacent buildings and nearby signs.
      (3)   The similarity or dissimilarity of the sign’s size and shape to the
size and shape of other signs in the area.
      (4)   The similarity or dissimilarity of the style of lettering or number
of words on the sign to the style of lettering or number of words of nearby
signs.
      (5)   The compatibility of the type of illumination, if any, with the
type of illumination in the area.
      (6)   The compatibility of the materials used in the construction of the
sign with the materials used in the construction of other sign in the area.

   1325.11  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)    Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this or prior
ordinances, which do not conform to the provisions of this code, and signs
which are accessory to a nonconforming use shall be deemed nonconforming signs
and may remain except as qualified below. The owner of a nonconforming sign has
the burden of establishing the nonconforming status of a sign and the physical
characteristics and location of such signs.
      (1)   Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged nor shall any feature of
a nonconforming sign, such as illumination or technology, be increased.
Nonconforming signs shall not be replaced or structurally reconstructed except
as permitted by this code.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs shall not be moved for any distance on the same
lot or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign
conform in all respects to the provisions of this code.

to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its area may be restored
within six (6) months after such destruction or damage but shall not be
enlarged in any manner. If such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent
exceeding fifty percent (50%) , the sign shall not be reconstructed but may be
replaced with a sign that is in full accordance with the provisions of this
code.
      (4)   A nonconforming sign which is changed to becoming conforming or
replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and
thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this code.
      (5)   A nonconforming sign structure shall be subject to removal. In
addition, a nonconforming sign structure shall be removed if the use to which
it is accessory has not been in operation for a period of one year or more.
Such structure sign shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the property. If
the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign structure, the zoning officer
shall give the owner fifteen (15) days' written notice to remove it. Upon
failure to comply with this notice, the zoning officer may enter the property
upon which the sign is located and remove any such sign or may initiate such
action as may be necessary to gain compliance with this provision. The cost of
such removal shall be chargeable to the owner of the property.
   (b)    Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good
repair a nonconforming sign. Nonconforming signs shall not be extended or
structurally reconstructed or altered in any manner, except a sign face may be
changed so long as the new face is equal to or reduced in height and sign area.
(Passed 7-7-22.)

opinion, has become insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, and,
as such, presents an immediate threat to the safety of the public. If such
action is necessary to render a sign safe, the cost of such emergency removal
or repair shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of
notice of charges.
   (d)    Nuisance. Any sign which constitutes a nuisance shall be abated by
the owner within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning Officer. At any time,
the Zoning Officer may cause the nuisance to be abated with the costs charged
to the owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such
sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (e)    Illegal Sign and Disrepair. Any sign which is illegal or in disrepair
shall be made conforming and/or repaired within thirty (30) days of notice from
the Zoning Officer. If an illegal sign or a sign in disrepair is not made
conforming and/or repaired, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed
or repaired and the cost of such removal or repair shall be charged to the
owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with
payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges. Signs of disrepair

of the sign, cracked portions of the sign face, broken lighting, graffiti, and
unleveled portions of the sign structure or face.
   (f)    Expired Permit. Any sign for which a sign permit has expired shall be

will intention of opening that business back up within one year’s time of
cessation. All signs shall be constructed and mounted in compliance with the
West Virginia Code.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1325.15 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   The purpose of this section is to address that temporary signs pose distinct
concerns with visual clutter, safety in erection and display, and removal when
the time for display has concluded. Temporary signs also pose distinct concerns
with materials quality. The following provisions and individual zoning of
temporary signs per district serve to address these concerns.
   (a)    Temporary signs require a permit, except as provided in this article,
and may be permitted up to thirty (30) days each calendar year.
   (b)    A use may erect one temporary, off-premises sign on property in any

the single-family, multi-family, and conservation zoning districts.
   (d)    No more than two (2) permitted temporary signs may be displayed per
lot in the mixed use and general commercial districts.

ARTICLE 1327
Nonconforming Uses, Lots and Structures
1327.01    Purpose.
1327.03    Nonconforming uses.
1327.05    Nonconforming structures.
1327.07    Nonconforming lots.
1327.09    Nonconforming accessory uses and structures.
   1327.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)    The purpose of this article is to set forth standards and regulations
regarding the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance (or any amendment
subsequent thereto) that do not conform to this Zoning Ordinance. These
standards shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as
defined by this ordinance.
   (b)    Nothing in this section prohibits alterations or additions to or
replacement of buildings or structures owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer, or the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing
purposes, or the use or acquisition of additional land which may be required
for the protection, continuing development, or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial, or manufacturing operation of any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing use. (Passed 7-7-22.)
      
   1327.03  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)    These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any
zoning district that is a nonconforming use as defined by this ordinance.
Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one zoning district to another zoning district of a different
classification, these regulations shall apply to any uses which thereby become
nonconforming.
   (b)    Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
ordinance, a lawful use of a lot or structure exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended, such use
may be sold or otherwise transferred to other owners and may be continued as
long as it remains otherwise lawful in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
   (c)    Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow
the continuation of a non-conforming use.
   (d)    Nonconforming uses existing at the time this ordinance was passed, or
at the time a subsequent amendment creates the nonconforming use, may extend
within the building which housed the nonconforming use at the time this
ordinance was passed, or at the time a subsequent amendment creates the
nonconforming use, provided that the area to which the nonconforming use
extends was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use, and that
no structural alterations are made within the building in order to allow the
use to extend, except those that may be required by the Building Code.
   (e)    Once a non-conforming use has been changed or converted to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
   (f)    When a nonconforming use is abandoned for twelve (12) months,
abandonment is presumed and the non-conforming use shall not be allowed to be
re-established. If the property has been abandoned, then any future use of the
land, buildings, or structures shall conform and be in accordance with all
applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of the particular zoning
district wherein the property is located.
   (g)    The non-conforming use of a building or land which has been abandoned
shall not
thereafter be returned to such non-conforming use. Abandonment of a non-
conforming use shall be presumed if one (1) or more of the following conditions
exists, indicating intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the
nonconforming use:
      (1)   When the intent of the owner to discontinue the nonconforming use
is apparent;
      (2)   Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property have
been disconnected;
      (3)   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair as
evidenced by proper code violation documentation;
      (4)   When it has been replaced by a conforming use;
      (5)   When it has been changed to a use permitted by conditional use by
the Board of Zoning Appeals; or
      (6)   The business license issued by the Town of Fayetteville has
expired.
   (h)   The extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming
structure shall not be deemed the extension of a nonconforming use.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1327.05  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A non-conforming structure containing a use permitted in the zoning district
in which it is located may continue only in accordance with the provisions of
this article.
   (a)    Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of nonconforming structures.
   (b)    A non-conforming structure may not, under any circumstances, be
enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity except as noted
below:
      (1)   Nonconforming structures used for a permitted use may be enlarged,
provided that the enlargement shall not create any additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of such structure, except
that porches and decks may be added or extended into rear setbacks up to fifty
percent (50%) of the setback requirements for the district in which the
nonconforming structure is located.
      (2)   Nonconforming structures used for a nonconforming use may add or
extend porches and decks into rear setbacks up to fifty percent (50%) of the
setback requirements for the district in which the nonconforming structure is
located. Buildings or structures with nonconforming setbacks may extend along a
line extending from the greatest point of nonconforming setback parallel to the
lot line from which the setback is measured, provided the setback nonconformity
is not increased. A lawful nonconforming structure, which is damaged the extent
of fifty percent (50%) or more of its appraised value, as valuated within
twelve (12) months of when the damage occurred, shall not be restored unless it
is in full conformance with this code, except that single-family homes may be
rebuilt within the original building’s boundaries and no taller than the
original building unless exceeding the boundaries or height of the original
building would not increase the structure’s nonconformity.
      (3)   A lawful nonconforming structure which is damaged, by neither
malfeasance nor wanton disregard by an interested party, to the extent of less
than fifty percent (50%) of its appraised value, as valuated within twelve (12)
months of when the damage occurred, may be reconstructed, provided that:
         A.   The reconstructed structure shall not exceed the height, area, or
volume of the original structure;
         B.   Reconstruction shall be commenced within one year from the date
the structure was destroyed or condemned and shall be carried on without
interruption; and
         C.   An application to reconstruct the structure is made to the Board
of Zoning Appeals prior to reconstruction.
            (Passed 7-7-22.)
   1327.07 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)    Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a nonconforming
vacant lot existing and of official record as of the effective date of this
ordinance may be developed for any of the uses permitted by these regulations
in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the use meets all
applicable yard and setback requirements for the zoning district in which the
lot is located.
   (b)    A non-conforming vacant lot shall not be developed if it could be
combined with an adjoining lot (said lot being owned by the same person and any
or all future assigns) on or after the effective date of these regulations in
order to create a single lot. Where an owner owns adjoining property,
construction may occur across the lot lines if that is the only way the yard
requirements may be met without a variance. If said combination, however,
results in the creation of a single lot that is more than one and one-half
(1.5) times the minimum lot width or area required in the zoning district, then
the single lot may be divided into two lots of equal width and area without
being further classified as non-conforming. For the purposes of this section,
"adjoining" shall be deemed to mean the sharing of one or more common lot lines
and access to both lots can be provided by the same street without crossing
that street.
(Passed 7-7-22.)
   1327.09 NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after
the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or
destruction unless such accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made
to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located,
except this provision does not apply where reconstruction of damaged principal
structures is performed in accordance with Section
1327.05(b). No nonconforming accessory use or structure shall become or replace
any terminated principal nonconforming use or structure.

1373.01 INTRODUCTION.
    (a)   The procedure for obtaining approval of a subdivision plan shall
include, basically two steps:
      (1)   Preliminary layout.
      (2)   Subdivision plat.
   (b)   However, before preparing the preliminary layout, the subdivider, or
his authorized agent, may present a pre-application sketch plan to the Planning
Commission to facilitate a discussion of any requirements of these regulations.
In addition, the subdivider should also discuss the preliminary layout with the
Health Department whose approval is required by these regulations. (Passed 5-
23-74.)
1373.02 PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.
   (a)   Except as provided by Section
1373.04, prior to filing an application for the approval of a subdivision plat,
the subdivider shall file an application for approval of a preliminary layout.
This application shall:
      (1)   Be made on forms available at the County Clerk's Office and at all
regularly scheduled meetings of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Include all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide.
      (3)   Be accompanied by two copies of the preliminary layout, as
described in Section
1385.01 .
      (4)   Be presented to the chairman of the Planning Commission or his
representative fourteen days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered.
   (b)   The Planning Commission will carefully review the practicability of
the preliminary layout, taking into consideration the requirements of the
community and the best use of the land being subdivided. In determining whether
approval of the preliminary layout shall be granted, the Planning Commission
shall determine if the preliminary layout provides for:
      (1)   Coordination of subdivision streets with existing and planned
streets or highways.
       (2)   Coordination with an extension of facilities included in the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Establishment of minimum width, depth, and area of lots within the
projected subdivision.
      (4)   Distribution of population and traffic in a manner tending to
create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, and the harmonious
development of the Town.
      (5)   Fair allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and
semi-public buildings, homes, utilities, business, and industry.
   (c)   Following the review of the preliminary layout and other material
submitted for conformity thereof to these regulations and a discussion with the
subdivider of changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements
to be made by him, the Planning Commission shall, within forty-five days, act
thereon as submitted or modified, and if approved, the Planning Commission
shall express its approval as tentative approval and state all changes and/or
additions, if any, that are required for such approval, or if disapproved,
shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor in the minutes of the
meeting.
   (d)   The action of the Planning Commission shall be noted on the two copies
of the preliminary layout, referenced and attached to any conditions
determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained
by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   For any subdivision or portion of subdivision, the Planning Commission
shall state in writing the character and extent of required public improvements
for which waivers may have been requested by the subdivider, and which in the
opinion of the Planning Commission may be waived without jeopardy to public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent to or in proximity to
the proposed subdivision.
   (f)   Approval of the preliminary layout shall not constitute approval of
the subdivision plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to
the lay-out submitted on the preliminary layout, as a guide to the preparation
of the subdivision plat which will be submitted for approval of the Planning
Commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of these
regulations and the conditions of the approval, if any.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1373.03 SUBDIVISION PLAT.
   (a)   Except as provided by Section
1373.04, within eighteen months of the tentative approval of the preliminary
layout, the applicant shall file with the Planning Commission an application

      (1)   Be made on forms available at the County Clerk's Office and at all
regularly scheduled meetings of the Planning Commission .

      (5)   Be accompanied by a fee of plus per acre, or part thereof, that the
proposed subdivision exceeds five acres in area. If the application is
disapproved, one-half of the fee shall be returned. A full fee must be paid on
any subsequent application, even if the same land, or any part thereof, is
involved.
   (b)   The official submittal date shall be the first regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission which falls fourteen days or more after the
applicant's submission of a written application for approval of a subdivision
plat.
   (c)   Upon receipt of a written application for approval of a subdivision
plat, the Planning Commission, if it tentatively approves the application,
shall set a date for a hearing within forty-five days after the official
submittal date. The Planning Commission shall notify the applicant in writing,
and notify by general publication or otherwise any person or governmental unit
having a probable interest in the subdivision plat.
   (d)   The subdivision plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary
layout as approved by the Planning Commission. In determining whether approval
of the subdivision plat shall be granted, the Planning Commission shall
determine if the subdivision plat satisfies the criteria set forth in Section
1373.02(b).
   (e)   As a condition of approval of a subdivision plat the Planning
Commission may specify:
      (1)   The manner in which streets shall be laid out, graded, and
improved.
      (2)   Provision for water, sewage, and other utility services.
      (3)   Provision for schools.
      (4)   Provision for essential municipal services.
      (5)   Provision for recreational facilities.
   (f)   The Planning Commission may approve a subdivision plat in which the
improvements and installations have not been completed as required by these
regulations if the applicant provides a bond which shall:
      (1)   Run to the Town.
      (2)   Be in an amount determined by the Planning Commission to be
sufficient to complete the improvements and installations in compliance with
these regulations.
      (3)   Be with surety satisfactory to the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Specify the time for the completion of the improvements and
installations.
   (g)   Any funds received from these bonds shall be used lay the legally
constituted body charged with making public improvements for the Town only for
completion of the improvements and installations for which they were provided,
and without prior appropriation.
   (h)   The Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the subdivision plat within forty-five days after the hearing. If
the Planning Commission approves, it shall affix its seal upon the subdivision
plat and notify the applicant within five days. If the Planning Commission
conditionally approves, it shall set forth the conditions in its own record and
provide the applicant with a copy within five days. If the Planning Commission
disapproves, it shall set forth its reasons in its own record and provide the
applicant with a copy within five days.
   (i)   The subdivider shall file the subdivision plat with the County Clerk
within ninety days of the date of the seal of approval. Any subdivision plat
not so filed shall become null and void. No changes, erasures, modifications,
or revisions shall be made on any subdivision plat after the Planning
Commission has affixed its seal of approval. In the event that any subdivision
plat, when filed with the County Clerk, contains any such changes, the
subdivision plat shall be considered null and void.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1373.04 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   In the case of a minor subdivision, four copies of a deed description of the
lots to be thus created, plus four copies of a map showing lot dimensions,
bearings, location of monuments and the relationship of the lots to the street
upon which they front, shall be sufficient for consideration for final approval
by the Planning Commission. This submittal shall include the information
required by Section
1373.02(c) and shall be filed with an application for subdivision approval with
the Planning Commission. If approved by the Planning Commission, the
application shall be subject to the requirements of Section
1373.03(i).

1377.01 GENERAL.
    The following planning and design standards shall be complied with and no
higher standard may be required by the Planning Commission except where it
finds that because of exceptional and unique conditions of topography,
location, shape, size, drainage, or other physical features of the site, or
because of the special nature and character of surrounding development, the
minimum standards specified herein would not reasonably protect or provide for
public health, safety, or welfare. Any higher standard required shall be
reasonable and shall be limited to the minimum additional improvements
necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare. (Passed 5-23-74.)
1377.02 STREETS.
    (a)   General Planning Standards.
      (1)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of
all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in
relation to existing and planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets.
      (2)   Where such is not shown in the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangements
of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for the continuation of
appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning
Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other
conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
      (3)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged .
      (4)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with a reserve (buffer) strip contained in a non-access
reservation between the street right of way and rear property lot line, or such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (5)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of- way, at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land such as for
park purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with
due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.

except where their control is placed with the Town under conditions approved by
the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Intersections of minor streets with arterial or collector streets
shall be held to a minimum to avoid hazard and delay.
      (8)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where it is necessary to
provide the remaining half of a previously approved half street.
      (9)   No duplicate street names shall be used, which in the opinion of
the Planning Commission will be confused with the names of existing streets.
Streets that are extensions of or in alignment with existing named streets
shall bear the names of the existing streets.
      (10)   Where the subdivision abuts or fronts on arterial streets,
sidewalks shall be required, and shall be of size and type as approved by the
Planning Commission.
      (11)   No dead-end streets shall be permitted without a suitable turn-
around. Dead-end streets extending to tract boundary lines, which are intended
to connect to future streets in adjoining tracts and dead-end streets within a
tract which are to be extended, shall be provided with a temporary turn-
around. Appropriate arrangements shall be made for those portions of temporary
turn-arounds outside of street right-of-way to revert to abutting property
owners at such time as streets shall be extended.
      (12)   When continuing street lines (projected right-of-way tangents)
deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall
be connected by a curve, with a radius at the inner street right-of-way line
not less than 350 feet; where continuous street lines of arterial streets
deflect more than five degrees from each other, they shall be connected by a
curve of not less than 800 feet radius.
      (13)   Where street grades exceed five percent (5%), gutters shall be
paved.
      (14)   Minor streets leading from the same subdivision shall not
intersect on the same side of a major thoroughfare at intervals of less than
800 feet.
      (15)   Radius corners or diagonal cut-offs shall be provided on the
property line substantially concentric with or parallel to the chord of the
curb radius corners.
      (16)   Where any street intersection will involve topographic features or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that might create a traffic hazard
through limiting visibility, such ground and/or vegetation shall be cut and
kept cut to a height not exceeding three and one-half feet in conjunction with
the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to
provide adequate sight distance and a vision clearance within the triangle
formed as provided by Section 
1333.17 . 
      (17)   Service drives.
         A.   Service drives may be provided in residential, commercial, and
industrial districts as private access ways.
         B.   Service drive intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall
be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to
permit safe vehicular movements.
         C.   Dead-end service drives shall be avoided when possible, but if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-
end as determined by the Planning Commission.

         (Passed 5-23-74.)
1377.04 LOTS.
    (a)   General Planning Standards.
      (1)   The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use proposed.
      (2)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
      (3)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
An easement of suitable width, across which there shall be no right-of-way, may
be required along the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
      (4)   The subdivision plan shall provide each lot with satisfactory
access to an existing public street or to a subdivision street that will be
offered for dedication at the time of the subdivision plat approval.

provided for utilities where they are anticipated.
   (b)   Permanent utility easements shall not exceed thirty feet in width,
unless exceptional circumstances require additional width.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1377.07 STORM DRAINAGE.
    (a)   All subdivisions shall be related to the drainage pattern affecting
the areas involved, with proper provision to be made for adequate storm
drainage facilities. Storm drainage plans shall reflect potential surface
runoff within the drainage area after development and shall comply with the
requirements of the engineer.
   (b)   Where a subdivision is traversed foy a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm easement of drainage right-
of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and of such
width as to encompass the twenty-five year flood area of such watercourse.
   (c)   Right-of-way for storm drainage must be sufficient for facilities to
handle not only the anticipated discharge from the property being subdivided,
but also the anticipated runoff that will occur when property at a higher
elevation in the drainage basin is developed.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1377.08 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Where a proposed park, playground, school, or other public use shown
in a Comprehensive Plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the

1381.01 MONUMENTS.
   Permanent monuments made of concrete, granite, or some suitable equivalent
and at least thirty-six inches in length and four inches square shall be so
placed that all block corners, angle points, and points of curves can be
accurately re-established. Iron pipes, at least twenty-four inches in length
and with a diameter of three-fourths inches, shall be placed at all points on
lot boundary lines where there is a change of direction and at all lot corners,
unless a permanent monument is required at such point.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1381.02 UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Utility and street improvements shall be provided in each new
subdivision in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Water supply and fire hydrants.
         A.   Public or Central Water Supply Available. If public or approved
central water supply is utilized, the system shall be designed with adequate
main sizes and fire hydrant water supply to meet the Association of Fire
Underwriters specifications for a protected area. Such system shall be approved
by the public agency or authority operating the central water system.
          B.   No Public Water.
            1.   In general. A project water system with a central well,
adequately planned and protected, is often less expensive to install than an
individual well serving each lot. It is also easier to protect against
contamination. If contamination does occur, it is simpler and more efficient to
purify the water from a central well than from numerous individual wells.
            2.   Project system. If a project system is planned, it shall be
approved by the County Health Department and the central well drilled, tested
and approved prior to filing the application for the subdivision. All land
within 100 feet of a project well shall be suitably protected and restricted
from development. All lines shall be six inch minimum in size, unless smaller
sizes are permitted by the Planning Commission and shall be according to the
standards of the nearest central or public water supply system if one exists
within two miles of the development.
            3.   Individual wells. If the water supply is to be from individual
wells, the developer shall provide at least one test well for each unit of ten
or less lots in the subdivision, location of such well to be approved by the
Planning Commission. Test wells shall be drilled, cased, and grout sealed into
bedrock, shall be not less than twenty-five feet deep, and shall have a
production capacity of not less than five gallons per minute of safe drinking
water as certified by the County Health Department.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer facilities. No storm water shall be allowed to enter
sanitary sewers. Proof shall be submitted showing that all plans of sewer
extensions have been approved by the County Health Department.
         A.   On-the-lot sewage disposal systems are generally unsatisfactory
even when carefully designed and constructed and given the best of maintenance.
Poor design, inadequate construction, or poor maintenance can result in
conditions dangerous to health and generally obnoxious to the senses. In view
of the above, individual lot on site sewage disposal systems will not be
approved within the limits of the Town.
         B.   Project systems shall be designed by a licensed engineer, shall
provide a six inch minimum size connection to each lot, and shall have an
adequate sewage disposal plant with suitable arrangements for the operation
thereof. Plans shall be approved by the County Health Department.
      (3)   Storm drainage.
         A.   Capacity.
            1.   Storm drainage facilities shall provide a clear and protected
channel fully adequate to handle runoff from a five-year storm. The developer
should keep in mind that more severe storms occur at less frequent intervals
and, where feasible, so design subdivisions that especially heavy runoff
exceeding the capacity of the required channels can be handled with the least
possible damage to improvements and structures.
            2.   The rational method shall ordinarily be used in computing
runoff, using the formula Q = CIA wherein:
               a.   Q = water reaching channel, culvert, bridge, or storm sewer
in cfs.
               b.   I = rainfall in inches per hour.
               c.   C = coefficient of runoff suggested is as follows:
                  i.   Areas primarily paved or in building (such as shopping
centers) - .85
                  ii.   Primarily residential area with lots smaller than 7,500
square feet or apartment areas -
                     .55
                  iii.   Primarily residential areas with lots 7,500 sq. ft, to
½ acre - .40
                  iv.   Primarily residential areas with lots 20,000 sq. ft. or
over - .35
                  v.   Cemeteries, park land, and other permanent open areas -
.30
               d.   A = Area in Acres.
            3.    Minimum pipe size shall be twelve inches.
            4.   In small drainage areas intended for residential development,
the following rule of thumb may, if desired, be substituted where applicable.
               a.   For drainage areas less than one acre in area:
                   12" pipe
               b.   For drainage areas 1 to 2 acres in area: 15"pipe
               c.   For drainage areas 2 to 4 acres in area: 18" pipe
          B.   General Design.
            1.   Preferred runoff pattern. Preferred design of streets and
grading in relation to storm drainage shall be such that runoff from roofs,
driveways, and other impervious surfaces will be collected in the ditches and/
or gutters along the street in short runs, (three or four hundred feet), and
will then be diverted from the street surface into storm sewers or natural
watercourses. Streets should be located away from watercourses unless storm
sewers are to be installed.
            2.   Downstream disposal. Subdivision and development of an area
increases and concentrates the runoff of storm water from the area. Subdividers
are warned that such increase may cause flood or erosion damage to undeveloped
properties lying downstream. Storm drainage channels opening on unimproved land
shall empty into natural watercourses unless suitable agreement is reached with
the owner of the downstream property for other method of handling. In any
instance, the disposal of storm drainage downstream shall be satisfactory to
the Planning Commission as advised by the Engineer.
         C.   Open Watercourses. The use of open watercourses for drainage may
involve problems relating to safety, erosion control, stagnant water,
protection of capacity, and appearance, all of which shall be given adequate
attention by the developer as follows:
            1.   Safety. Broad, shallow courses shall be created wherever
necessary to increase capacity or eliminate steep banks. Ditches shall,
wherever feasible, be in the shape of a wide top V with rounded or squared
invert.
            2.   Erosion control. Adequate measures shall be taken to prevent
erosion, The Planning Commission shall require seeding, sodding, planting,
riprap, or such other measures as may be necessary to prevent scouring.
            3.   Drainage. The developer shall guard against the creation or
continuation of swampy areas or stagnant pools. The Planning Commission shall
require fill and/or channel improvements in order to forestall such problems.
            4.   Protection of capacity. The developer shall provide adequate
measures for the protection of open drainage channels by establishing drainage
easements sufficiently wide (generally twenty feet) to enable the working of
the channel by motorized equipment or alternately, where authorized by the
Planning Commission, a center block park of a minimum width of fifty feet. All
easements shall prohibit the erection of structures, the dumping of fill, or
the alteration or obstruction of the watercourses without the written
permission of the Planning Commission. Property lines shall be so designed as
to allow drainage easements, except that drainage easements may be allowed to
cross lots larger than one acre.
            5.   Appearance. The developer should keep in mind that natural
watercourses can be an attractive asset to the subdivision as well as to the
community and, where possible, should improve and beautify the watercourses to
this end.
         D.   Design of Storm Sewers.
            1.   Size and grade. Storm sewers shall have a minimum diameter of
twelve inches and a minimum grade of one-half per cent (0.5%).
            2.   Manholes. Manholes shall not be more than 300 feet apart where
pipe sizes of twenty-four inches or less are used, and not more than 540 feet
apart where larger sizes are installed.
            3.   Change in direction. Special sections of ten to fifteen feet
radii shall be installed where abrupt changes are made in alignment.
         E.   Design of Ditches and Gutters.
            1.   Length of flow. Subdivisions should be so designed that length
of flow or water in gutter or roadside ditch does not exceed 400 feet, except
that in exceptional cases, runs up to 800 feet in length may be permitted by
the Planning Commission. Runs exceeding the maximum shall be put in storm
sewers or diverted to natural drainageways,
            2.   Minimum grade. All enclosed drainage courses shall be designed
with sufficient grade to create a cleansing velocity of three feet per second.
A lesser grade may be permitted by the Planning Board where a greater grade
cannot be achieved.
            3.   Street crossing. Water in gutters and ditches shall not be
allowed to flow over intersecting streets but shall be placed in adequate
culverts.
            4.   Depth and shape of ditches.
               a.   Where roadside ditches are permitted for runs of more than
300 feet, or where subgrade drainage is necessary, the bottom of such ditch
should be below the subgrade, and at a minimum, should be approximately
eighteen inches below the crown of the road.
               b.   Ditches shall be V shaped or parabolic with sides sloping
at approximately one inch vertical to three inches horizontal, except where
other cross section plan is authorized.
         F.   Erosion Control. Suitable headwalls, endwalls, ditch seeding or
sodding, and other procedures or devices to prevent erosion shall be used.
(Passed 5-23-74.)
1381.03 STREET AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Arterial Streets. Cross sections as determined by the engineer and
Planning Commission or by the State Road Commission.
   (b)   Collector Streets. Two five foot sidewalks each one foot from property
lines.
   (c)   Minor Streets and Cul-de-Sacs. Two five foot sidewalks each one foot
from property line.
   (d)   Marginal Access Streets. Approximately fourteen feet to be used as
part of the separation strip between marginal road and adjacent arterial or
collector.
   (e)   Streets Along Development Boundaries and Streets Connecting the
Development with Existing Improved Street System. Cross sections as determined
by engineer and Planning Commission.
   (f)   Grading and Centerline Gradients. Per plans and profiles approved by
the engineer.
   (g)   Street Lighting. Per plans and specification approved by the engineer.
   (h)   Street Name Signs. Street name signs at all intersections, the design
of which must be approved by the Planning Commission.
   (i)   Residential street construction standards shall meet the
specifications set forth on the drawings in this section. These specifications
are established for natural conditions of satisfactory subgrades, slope, and
drainage. Where these natural conditions are other than favorable, the Planning
Commission, after consultation with the engineer, may require reasonably higher
standards for gravel base and pavement and may specify special treatment of the
subgrade.
   (j)   For commercial, industrial, and other non-residential subdivisions,
construction standards for required improvements shall be specified by the
Planning Commission.
   (k)   The developer shall furnish a performance bond or cause a deposit
sufficient to cover the full costs of the construction of such utility and
street improvements as may be required by the Planning Commission pursuant to
the West Virginia Code.
   (l)   A developer may install such utility and street improvements at his
own expense or, in the alternative, may secure the formation of a special
district to install such utility and street improvements pursuant to laws of
the State.

being served shall be afforded a hearing before the appeals board upon petition
to the Appeals Board; but if no such petition is filed within 24 hours of that
person's being served with such an emergency order, the person to whom such an
emergency order is directed shall comply with such order by the end of such 24-

stipulated, or appear before the Code Official and show cause why he cannot or
ought not comply with such order; and any owner who shall fail to do so shall,
upon the expiration of the time allotted, be deemed to be maintaining a
nuisance, which shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this article.

   There is hereby created a Fayetteville Code Enforcement Agency which shall
consist of six (6) members: The Mayor, the Town Manager, Chief of the
Fayetteville Fire Department, Chief of the Fayetteville Police Department, Town
Building Inspector, and a member of Town Council selected by the Mayor.
(Passed 8-17-23.)
1730.03 CLOSING AND REMOVAL OF UNSAFE STRUCTURES.
   (a)   The Code Enforcement Agency may order the repair, alteration,
improvement, closing, demolition or removal of any dwelling, building or
structure that is determined by the Code Enforcement Agency Official to be
unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this article.
   (b)   In order to make a determination regarding the classification of a
structure as unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety
or welfare pursuant to this article and to determine and enforce the
appropriate remedy for any such structure, Code Enforcement Agency Officials
shall be entitled to make inspections, perform investigations, obtain search
warrants, issue notices, require corrective measures, present complaints to the
municipal judge, and exercise all other powers and duties authorized by West
Virginia Code Section 8-12-16, as it may be amended.
   (c)   The powers and duties granted in this article are in addition to those
otherwise granted by law and shall not be construed to limit any other lawful
powers of the Town, including the power of Code Enforcement Agency Officials,
to interpret and enforce the Building Code of the Town of Fayetteville, West
Virginia.
   (d)   This article shall be construed broadly so as to promote the purpose
of efficiently removing dangerous conditions that are harmful to the community.
(Ord. 2018-1. Passed 2-1-18.)
1730.04  INSPECTION.
   For purposes of inspections performed pursuant to this article, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   When a Code Enforcement Agency Official enters the premises of the
property for investigating or inspecting any structure, dwelling or building,
the investigation shall be conducted in a way that minimizes the inconvenience
to the owner or person in possession.
   (b)   Except in exigent circumstances and as permitted by law, the Code
Enforcement Agency shall provide reasonable advance notice of the inspection to
the owner and request permission from the owner to enter the property.
   (c)   If the owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the Code
Enforcement Agency, or if the owner refuses entry, the Code Enforcement Agency
may obtain an administrative search warrant from either the Municipal Court or
the Fayette County Magistrate Court. Before obtaining an administrative search
warrant, a Code Enforcement Agency Official is required to make a sworn
statement and prima facie case showing that the Code Enforcement Agency was
unable to gain access to the structure, dwelling or building after reasonable
and good faith efforts, and that there is a legitimate and substantial safety
concern involving the structure, dwelling or building that supports the
requested entry.
   (d)   If the administrative search warrant is granted by the Court, and if
the owner can be located, the Code Enforcement Agency shall provide the owner a
copy of the administrative search warrant five days before entering the
property. If there is a tenant or other person in possession of the structure
who is not the owner, and if such person(s) can be located, the Code
Enforcement Agency shall also provide such person(s) a copy of the
administrative search warrant.
   (e)   Any entry pursuant to this section shall be made for the sole purpose
of inspection of the structure, dwelling, or building for unsafe or unsanitary
conditions and not for the purpose of criminal prosecution or gathering
evidence for use in any criminal charge or proceeding unrelated to the unsafe
or unsanitary condition of the structure, dwelling or building.
      (Ord. 2018-1. Passed 2-1-18.)
1730.05 CORRECTION OF UNSAFE CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Upon a determination by the Code Enforcement Agency that a structure
is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or
welfare, the Town may take corrective action by causing it to be vacated,
closed, removed or demolished either directly or by the use of third party
agents, without either the agreement of the owner or a Court Order, pursuant to
the following conditions:

other similar relief restraining action by the Enforcement Agency.
         B.   The notice shall be served upon the owner or landowner, by
conspicuously posting and attaching a copy of the notice to the subject
property, and by serving the notice on the owner or landowner in the same
manner as service of a complaint as set forth in Section 1730.09(b).
         C.   If the Code Enforcement Agency cannot effect personal service on
the owner, a Code Enforcement Agency Official shall subscribe a written
affidavit, to be maintained for a minimum of two years, that demonstrates the
structure, dwelling or building falls within one of the categories set forth in
Section
1730.05(a)(2)A. or B. and sets forth the basis in reasonable detail including
documentation of same, and memorializes the Code Enforcement Agency Official’s
efforts to contact or get permission for entry and corrective action from the
owner; and the Code Enforcement Agency shall publish notice of its intent to
enter the property for the purpose of demolition or correction, along with the
address of the property, the name of the owner(s), and the date of the proposed
action, as a Class II legal advertisement consistent with the requirements of
West Virginia Code Section 59-3-2, the first of which shall run at least thirty
days before the date of the proposed action by the Code Enforcement Agency, and
the last being no later than twenty days before the date of the proposed action
by the Enforcement Agency.

in the time specified in the notice, then the Town shall have the authority to
proceed in correction or demolition of the subject dwelling, building or
structure.
   (b)   It shall be an absolute defense to any civil action by an owner,
landowner or tenant for damages resulting from the closure, demolition or other
corrective action taken by the Town under this section that the Town followed
the procedures set forth herein; provided, that the Town acted in good faith,
can demonstrate that the structure, dwelling or building falls within one of
the categories set forth in Section
1730.05(a)(2)A. or B., followed the procedures set forth in this section, and
had adopted the State Building Code at the time the closure, demolition or
other corrective action taken. (Ord. 2018-1. Passed 2-1-18.)
1730.06 RELIEF FROM ORDER FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   (a)   The owner of property subject to corrective action shall be given
notice of the right to apply to the Circuit Court of Fayette County for a
temporary injunction or other similar relief restraining correction or
demolition by the Town. Such notice shall be provided in the written notice
produced pursuant to Section
1730.05(a)(3)A.
   (b)   If an application for relief is made by the owner to the Circuit
Court, a hearing shall be had within twenty days of the application, or as soon
as reasonably possible.
   (c)   Continuances of the hearing provided for in this section may be made
for cause only. If a continuance is granted upon request by the owner, the
owner is required to pay into Court, in the form of a bond, any reasonable and
necessary costs related to the property likely to be incurred by the Town
during the continuance. This requirement for security is in addition to any
other bond required or authorized by the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure
or other applicable law.
   (d)   At the conclusion of a hearing held under this subdivision, if the
Court finds that the property is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental
to the public safety or welfare, the Court shall make and enter an order
granting the relief as requested by the Town. The Court may disburse any moneys
paid into Court by the owner in accordance with this section.
(Ord. 2018-1. Passed 2-1-18.)
1730.07  CIVIL ACTION FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION AND RECOVERY OF COSTS.
   (a)   In addition to any other rights provided by law, the Town may also
institute a civil action in Circuit Court against the landowner or other
responsible party to get an order to take corrective action up to and including
demolition of any structure, dwelling or building that is unsafe, unsanitary,
dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare; and to recover all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Town with respect to the property

statute, the presentation and oath or affirmation shall be made by a Code
Enforcement Agency Official or Town Attorney showing reason to have reliable
information and belief. If from the facts stated in the complaint the Municipal

initiating a criminal proceeding. A complaint lawfully authorized by this
subsection along with a summons setting forth the date, time and place of
appearance before the Municipal Judge shall be served in accordance with the
law of the State of West Virginia concerning the service of process in civil
actions, except that personal service of a summons and complaint may be made by
a Code Enforcement Agency Official. If service is made by certified mail under
Rule 4(d)(1)(D) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and delivery of
the summons and complaint is refused, the Code Enforcement Agency Official,
promptly upon receipt of the notice of the refusal, shall mail to the person or
entity being noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the
summons and complaint. If the first class mailing is not returned as
undeliverable by the U.S. Postal Service, service of the summons and complaint
is presumed to have been effectuated. Upon service of the summons and complaint
consistent with this subsection, the violation may be prosecuted consistent
with state and local law.

shall apply.
   (c)   Applicability.  
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any contractor, person, partnership,
business, or corporation to undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
development, new construction, substantial improvement, repair of substantial
damage, other repairs, or the placement or relocation of any structure
(including manufactured homes) within the Town of Fayetteville unless a permit
application has been completed and a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator. In addition, where land is partially or fully in the

(Ord. 2016-6. Passed 6-2-16.)
1735.02 INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this article
shall be interpreted so as to give this article its most reasonable
application.
   (1)   "Adjacent Property"  Adjacent Property includes any surface tract,
regardless of whether such surface tract is entirely within the Town of
Fayetteville, so long as a portion of said surface tract is located within the
Town of Fayetteville, which shares an immediate and common boundary up or down
stream to the property that is the subject of the application for Floodplain
Permit. Adjacent property also includes all other property that may be affected
by flooding.
   (2)   "Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties"  To adversely affect a property
the increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation must be more
than 1 foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect is that the 100-year
flood base flood elevation rises 1 foot or less the property is not "affected".
This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If prior permit(s) has/have been
approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the above definition would include
the cumulative impact to the base flood elevation.
   (3)   Appurtenant Structure  A structure on the same parcel of property as
the principal structure and the use of which is incidental and used for storage
only to the use of the principal structure. This does not include a gas or
liquid storage tank.
   (4)   Base Flood  Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   (5)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE)  The water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. For the purposes of this article, the one hundred (100) year flood or 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (See 100 year flood also)
   (6)   Basement  Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (7)   Certificate of Compliance  A certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this article.
   (8)   Compensatory storage  An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the special flood hazard area.
   (9)   Contractor- W.Va. Code §21-11-3(c) A person who in any capacity for
compensation, other than as an employee of another, undertakes, offers to
undertake, purports to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a bid to
construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or
demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who
performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.
      Contractor does not include:
      A.   One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without fabricating

proprietorship whose primary purpose is to prepare construction plans and
specifications used by the contractors defined in this section and who employs
a full time registered architect licensed to practice in this State or a
registered professional engineer licensed to practice in this State. Contractor
also does not include employees of such corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship.
   (10)   Critical Facility Any facility in which even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat.
Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations, police stations,
storage of critical records, and similar facilities. These should be given
special consideration when formulating regulatory alternatives and floodplain
management plans. A critical facility should not be located in a special flood
hazard area if at all possible. If a critical facility must be located in a
special flood hazard area it should be provided a higher level of protection so
that it can continue to function and provide services during a flood.

possible, to reduce the adverse impact of the noncompliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
   (39)   Special Flood Hazard Area  The land in the Floodplain Area subject to
a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A 1-30,
and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are
specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
   (40)   Start of Construction  (The definition for start of construction is
to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.)
The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit for
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   (44)   Subdivision  Development that includes a creation of individual land
parcels for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-way or
easements are obtained and recorded.
   (45)   Subject Property  "Subject property" includes the surface tract(s)
upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
   (46)   Substantial Damage Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-
related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement".
   (47)   Substantial Improvement  Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure before the start
of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all Ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
   (48)   Top of Bank  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
   (49)   Variance  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
   (50)   Violation  The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this article. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation
until such time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or
developments can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the
development is to bring the structure into compliance with the current
ordinance.
      (Ord. 2016-6. Passed 6-2-16.)
1735.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the Town of Fayetteville which are subject to a one percent or greater chance
of flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
and described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the Town of
Fayetteville by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 9/3/2010
or the most recent revision thereof including all digital data developed as
part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
the Town of Fayetteville by use of historic or other technical data and shown
on an officially recognized "FIRM". These areas shall be designated as
appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FlS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (3)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided
      (4)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-percent-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and three
feet. ln Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the Town of Fayetteville where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A Community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practical but, not later than six months from the date such information becomes
available, the Community shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The Town of Fayetteville may identify and regulate new flood hazard
or ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the Floodplain
Administrator:
         A.   Elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation or,
         B.   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site from
the SHFA
then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain Area and shall
not be required to conform to the provisions of this article.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Town of Fayetteville
Council sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be
on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 2016-6. Passed 6-2-16.)
1735.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.
      (1)   Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances
and Regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
Town of Fayetteville, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine:
         A.   The amount being invested and
         B.   The specific flood risk at the site.
The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to determine the
elevation above which the development and adjacent properties including but not
limited to existing buildings will be reasonably safe from flooding using
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be prepared by a registered
professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study shall include a
cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of
findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc.
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the Town of Fayetteville's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the Town of Fayetteville in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the Community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1735.08 (d).
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
(Ord. 2016-6. Passed 6-2-16.)
1735.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

Assessor "Building or Real Property Improvement Notice".
      (7)   Approved by County Health Department for Well, Septic and other
permits to assure facilities are designed and located in compliance with the
flood damage reduction requirements of this article.
   (b)   Basic Format.  The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Applicant shall provide names, addresses, and valid West Virginia
license numbers of all contractors working at the building site, or affidavits
stating that work is being performed by individuals exempt from contractor
licensing as set forth in Title 28, Series 2, section 3.9(b) of the West
Virginia Code of State Regulations or the most recent revision thereof, if
known at the time the Permit Application is submitted. If not known, applicant
shall provide the information within 14 days of execution of a contract with
its contractor(s) prior to beginning construction.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the proposed
development including tax map and parcel numbers and most recent deed book and
page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base
Flood Elevation and the location of the Floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to pay any and all
fees associated with the permitting process as set forth in Sections
1735.07 (c) and
1735.09 (i).
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow The Floodplain
Administrator and authorized representatives of floodplain management programs

Application File. The Floodplain Administrator shall consult with the applicant
to redact proprietary and confidential information from the contracts and
addendums that are not otherwise public information. Failure to present
contract(s) or addendums for review shall void the permit. If a licensed
contractor is not involved, or the work is of an aggregate construction cost
value of less than ten thousand dollars including material and labor, a brief
written description of proposed work and the estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure

         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement
shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new Non-Conversion Agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non
Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1735.08 (d).
      (2)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two feet above the Base
Flood elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants shall meet or exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on dry
flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above the
Base Flood Elevation
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. hereof, stating the structure in question,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            1.    The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
- used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only):
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Flood way boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction ofthe structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1735.08 (d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         B.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
Approximated Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or
two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data
and shall delineate the Floodway.
            1.   When a Flood insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts
      (3)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
Approximated Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development
of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to
be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled
from the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in Jots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 2016-6. Passed 6-2-16.)
1735.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10A and 10B as
authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-1 et seq. The anchoring shall be
adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties,
attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate
to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and Local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
         D.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer

manufactured home has been installed to the standards set forth in this
article.
      (2)   Appurtenant Structures.
         A.    When possible, appurtenant structures shall be located out of
the special flood hazard area.
         B.    Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            1.   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
               a.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size
and valued at less than $7,000. (Seven thousand dollars).
               b.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
               c.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
               d.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
               e.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2- 93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               f.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all
utilities shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               g.   Opening requirements:
   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by allowing for

                  (ii)    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade.
                  (iii)    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
            2.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in Section
1735.08 (d).
      (3)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
      (4)   Fill. The Town of Fayetteville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not result
in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely a affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to
the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with preconstruction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
article and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required below. For non-residential structures, fill shall be
placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (5)   Placement of Structures and other development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,    
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (6)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (7)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (8)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles " fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (9)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (10)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH
and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
      (11)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.

regulations or ordinances.

upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,

issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)

property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this article; and

requirements or provisions of this article or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the Town of Fayetteville Council of not less than fifty dollars
($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution.
Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall constitute
a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-
compliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance
with the article or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be

reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or
relocated in non-compliance with this article may be declared by the Town of

(Ord. 2012-9. Passed 1-3-13; Ord. 2016-13. Passed 11-3-16; Passed 6-16-22.)
   1800.06  BASIS FOR DECISION.
   The Historical Landmark Commission shall use as the basis for its decisions
and considerations, "The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic
Preservation Projects" as issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior as
shown in Section 1800.07.
   Maintenance of the character of the Historic District is to be given the
utmost consideration as the Commission reviews applications and plans and
issues decisions related thereto.
   When new construction or erection or relocation of a structure or an
addition to an existing structure is proposed within the Historic District, the
Commission shall evaluate the proposal,
application and plans based upon the "appropriateness" of the architectural
style design, or method of construction, or location as it relates to existing
nearby structures, sites or features, in order to ensure harmony and
compatibility will exist within the area and its environment or reasonable
substitution. Such provision shall not preclude erection of a structure of
contemporary design, but shall ensure that the size, location and design would
be complementary to the surrounding buildings, area, and sites.
   The burden of proof that the proposed project and its plans fall within the
guidelines aforementioned shall rest with the applicant.
(A.O.; Ord. 2016-13. Passed 11-3-16; Passed 6-16-22.)
   1800.07 STANDARDS FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROJECTS.
   Standards for historic preservation projects in the Historic District H
shall be"The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation
Projects".
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property that requires minimal alteration of the building structure, or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations which have no historic basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities or a reasonable substitution. Repair
or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any acquisition,
protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or
reconstruction project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historic, architectural, or cultural material and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, and character of the property,
neighborhood, or environment.
   (j)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.
      (A.O.; Passed 6-16-22.)
   1800.08 APPEALS.
   The applicant may appeal the decision of the Historical Landmark Commission
to the Board of Zoning Appeals in the same manner as other zoning matters are
so appealed, and the provisions of Section 1337.04 of the Zoning Ordinance
shall be applicable in this regard, with the Historical Landmark Commission
Chairman, or his designee, responsible for presenting the facts regarding the
requirements, decisions and determinations as viewed by the Commission.
(A.O.; Ord. 2016-13. Passed 11-3-16; Passed 6-16-22.)
   1800.09  OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS.

historians, historians, or any person with knowledge or a background relating
to any pertinent field for advise regarding the interpretation or application
of the provisions of the Historic District portion of this Zoning Ordinance.
The municipal attorney may, with prior consent of the Mayor, be consulted as
necessary. No professional consultation for which a fee will be charged is
authorized without specific approval of the Town Council, unless sufficient
funds have been set aside by the Planning Commission from its budget. The
Municipal Historic Landmark Commission should be consulted as to their opinion
with respect to any significant changes proposed to any existing structure or
site within the Historic District. Any decisions, however, shall rest with the
Historical Landmark Commission. (A.O.; Ord. 2016-13. Passed 11-3-16; Passed 6-
16-22.)
   1800.10  QUORUM.
   A majority of members of the Historical Landmark Commission shall constitute
a quorum. No action of the Commission is official however, unless authorized by
a majority of the Commission. The members of the Commission shall serve without
compensation, but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred.
(A.O.; Ord. 2016-13. Passed 11-3-16; Passed 6-16-22.)
   1800.11  CONFLICT.
   Prohibited uses shall fall within the requirements of all districts as shown
in their classes and should there by any conflict between requirements of the
classes, the most stringent requirements shall be followed.
(A.O.; Passed 6-16-22.)
