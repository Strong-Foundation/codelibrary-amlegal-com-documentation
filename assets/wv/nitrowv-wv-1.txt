purchase any tax-delinquent property which is within the city municipal limits,

of properties which meet the criteria of this division (G) shall regularly be
compiled by the Sheriff of the county, and the Authority may purchase any
qualifying tax-delinquent property for an amount equal to the taxes owed and
any related fees before such property is placed for public auction. Such
authority is in accordance with W. Va. Code 31-18E-9(g)(2).
      (3)   When the Authority exercises a right of first refusal in accordance
with division (G)(2) above, the Authority shall, within 15 days, provide
written notice to all owners of real property that is adjacent to the tax-
delinquent property. Any such property owner shall have a period of 120 days
from the receipt of notice, actual or constructive, to exercise a right to
purchase the tax-delinquent property from the Authority for an amount equal to
the amount paid for the property by the Authority; provided, that in the event
more than one adjacent land owner desires to purchase the tax-delinquent
property, it shall be sold to the adjacent property owner offering the highest
bid. It is the duty of the adjacent property owner to establish that he or she
is the actual owner of property that is adjacent to the tax-delinquent property
and all state and local taxes and all fees on his or her adjacent property are
current and non-delinquent. All such procedures are in compliance with W. Va.
Code 31-18E-9(g), and are subject to the sunset provisions of W. Va. Code 31-
18E-9(g)(4).

whenever any person is arrested for any violation of an ordinance of the city
or for any offense of which the Municipal Judge has jurisdiction, it shall be
lawful for the Municipal Judge, City Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk, Mayor,
Chief of Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police
headquarters to admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the
city in such an amount as in the discretion of the officer will secure the
prisoner’s presence, conditioned that the accused will appear upon a day named,
before the Municipal Judge of the city, to await trial; and every such bond
taken shall be filed as soon as practicable with the Municipal Court Clerk by
the officer approving and taking such bond; and the Municipal Judge, City
Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk, Mayor, Chief of Police and the desk sergeant
or person in charge, of police headquarters shall each have the power to
approve any bond taken under the provisions of this section, precedence being
given to the ranking officer present at police headquarters when such bond is
presented. No person shall be accepted as surety upon any penal bond unless he
or she shall acknowledge the bond before some official duly authorized by this
code or by state law to administer an oath, and shall make oath that he or she
is the owner in fee of real estate situated in Kanawha or Putnam County and
worth the amount of the bond over and above his or her debts and liabilities;
but the officers hereinbefore named in this section are hereby authorized and
empowered to accept a deposit in cash of an amount which, in the judgment of
the officer accepting the deposit, will be sufficient to cause the prisoner’s
appearance upon the day required of him or her before the Municipal Judge to
await trial upon the charge against him or her. The amount of such deposit
shall not be less than a sum sufficient in the judgment of the officer
accepting the same to satisfy any reasonable fine and costs which may be
imposed by the Municipal Judge. In the event any person so released upon bond
or such deposit shall fail to appear before the Municipal Judge for trial at
the appointed time, or, having appeared, shall leave the court without awaiting
trial, his or her bond shall be forfeited thereby to the city, and if a cash
deposit has been made to secure his or her release, the sum so deposited shall
be delivered to the Municipal Judge as soon as may be practicable, not later
than the following morning, and by him or her promptly turned in to the City
Treasury to the credit of the General Fund and accounted for by him or her in
the same manner that fines collected by him or her are accounted for; and in
the event of the forfeiture of a penal bond, the City Treasurer shall forthwith
take the steps necessary at law for the collection thereof.
   (B)   Bail bond cards issued by the American Automobile Association to its
members shall be accepted for traffic violations in accord with the terms of
such cards.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the admission
of a person to bail upon his or her own recognizance when such is authorized by
law and when the officer, in the exercise of sound discretion, considers it
proper so to do.
(Prior Code, § 173.08)
§ 35.09 REQUISITES AND DISPOSITION OF CASH DEPOSITS POSTED IN LIEU OF BAIL
BOND.
   No cash bond shall be accepted by any officer authorized to accept such bond
unless the prisoner and the officer authorized to accept it are present at
police headquarters or at the place where the prisoner is held in custody. The
money deposited as security for any person’s appearance shall be deposited with
the desk sergeant at police headquarters, to be by him or her safely kept until
the next regular session of the Municipal Court, when it shall be turned over
by the desk sergeant who received it to the Judge of the Municipal Court, and
by the Judge disposed of as required by the bond, this section and §
35.08.
(Prior Code, § 173.09)
§ 35.10 UNAUTHORIZED ACCEPTANCE OR APPROVAL OF CASH BOND; BOND IN FELONY CASES.
   If any officer shall accept or approve any cash bond at any place or in any
other manner than is herein provided for and authorized, such unauthorized
acceptance or approval shall constitute good cause for his or her suspension or
removal, or the reprimand or fining of such officer after a hearing on the
charge by Council. In case of the arrest of any person upon a charge of a
felony, the bond for his or her release, if approved, shall only be approved by
the Municipal Judge, or the Judge of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County or
Circuit Court of Putnam County, and no other officer of the city shall be
authorized to admit to bail any person charged with felony.
(Prior Code, § 173.10)

discretion in permitting the payment of such fine and costs in installments or
other conditions to be fixed by the court. At the end of such form there shall
be printed in bold face type, in a distinctive color the following: “THIS
STATEMENT IS MADE UNDER OATH. ANY FALSE STATEMENT OF A MATERIAL FACT TO ANY
QUESTION CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL CONSTITUTE FALSE SWEARING AND SHALL BE AN
OFFENSE AGAINST THIS SECTION. THE MAXIMUM PENALTY IS NOT TO EXCEED STATE LAW OR
IMPRISONED FOR A TERM NOT TO EXCEED STATE LAW, OR BOTH.” A copy of the petition
shall be retained by the defendant.
   (C)   If the defendant is unable to read or write, the court, or the Clerk,
may assist the defendant in completing the petition and require him or her to
affix his or her mark thereto. The consequences of the making of a false
statement shall be explained to such defendant.
   (D)   Any defendant who shall knowingly make a false statement of a material
fact to any question contained in the questionnaire authorized by this section

   When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of any such
fine or of any installment thereof, the court may issue a summons for such
person to appear before the court for a hearing on the question of whether such
person’s failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith. The court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, or upon a finding that the default was intentional or due to the lack of
a good faith effort to comply with the prior order of the court, may order such
person confined for such period up to 30 days as the court in its discretion
shall determine.

§ 38.017 COMPUTATION OF TAX; REMITTANCE.
   (A)   The taxes levied hereunder shall be due and payable in quarterly
installments on or before the expiration of one month from the end of the
quarter in which they accrue. The taxpayer shall, within one month from the
expiration of each quarter, make out an estimate of the tax for which he or she
is liable for such quarter, sign it and mail it, together with a remittance, in
the form required by §
38.026, of the amount of tax to the office of the City Treasurer. In estimating
the amount of tax due for each quarter, the taxpayer may deduct one-fourth of
the tax credit for industrial expansion allowable for the taxable year and one-
fourth of the total exemption allowed for the year. When the total tax for
which any person is liable under this subchapter does not exceed the sum of
$100 in any year, the taxpayer may pay the same quarterly as aforesaid or, with
the consent in writing of the City Treasurer, at the end of the month next
following the close of the tax year.
   (B)   Any other provision of this section notwithstanding, the City
Treasurer, if he or she deems it necessary to insure payment of the tax, may
require the return and payment under this section for periods of shorter
duration than quarter-year periods.
(Prior Code, § 711.17)
§ 38.018 RETURN AND REMITTANCE BY TAXPAYER.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year, each
taxpayer shall make a return for the entire tax year showing the gross proceeds
of sales or gross income of business, trade or calling, and compute the amount
of tax chargeable against him or her in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter and deduct the amount of quarterly payments (as hereinbefore
provided), if any, and transmit with his or her report a remittance in the form
required by §
38.026 covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him or her to the
office of the City Treasurer; such return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if
made by an individual, or by the president, vice president, secretary or
treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on
behalf of a partnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group
or combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm,
copartnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf of the taxpayer.
The City Treasurer, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the
annual return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable
additional time within which to make the same as may, by him or her, be deemed
advisable.
(Prior Code, § 711.18)
§ 38.019 ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   (A)   If the taxpayer shall make any error in computing the tax assessable

proper amount of taxes, and notify the taxpayer of his or her action by mailing
to him or her promptly a copy of the corrected assessment, and any additional
tax for which such taxpayer may be liable shall be paid within ten days after
the receipt of such statement.
   (B)   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on
the basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the City Treasurer and shall
be payable out of any funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at his
or her election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing
hereunder.

§ 38.020 FAILURE TO MAKE RETURN; ASSESSMENT BY CITY TREASURER WHEN RETURN
BELIEVED DEFICIENT.
   If any person shall fail or refuse to make a return, either in whole or in
part, or if the City Treasurer has reasonable ground to believe that any return
made is so deficient as not to form the basis of a satisfactory assessment of
the tax, he or she may proceed as he or she deems best to obtain information on
which to base the assessment of the tax. The City Treasurer may, in person or
by duly appointed agent, make examination of the books, records and papers, and
audit the accounts of any such person, and may take the evidence, on oath, of
any person whom he or she may believe shall be in possession of any relevant
information. As soon as possible after procuring such information as the City
Treasurer may be able to obtain as to any person failing or refusing to make a
return, he or she shall proceed to assess the tax and shall notify the person
assessed of the amount of the tax. The assessment of the tax by the City
Treasurer shall be final as to any person who refused to make a return.
(Prior Code, § 711.20)
§ 38.021 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   If the City Treasurer believes that the collection of any tax which he
or she is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he or she shall
thereupon make an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment.
The amount assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer
against whom a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within 20
days after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an assessment
becomes final.
   (B)   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy
assessment has been made must be accompanied by such security as the City
Treasurer may deem necessary to insure compliance with this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 711.21)
§ 38.022 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; HEARING.
   The City Treasurer shall give to the taxpayer written notice of any
assessment made pursuant to this subchapter. Unless the taxpayer to whom a
notice of assessment is directed shall, within 30 days after service thereof
(except in the case of jeopardy assessments), either personally or by certified
mail, file with the City Treasurer such a petition in writing, verified under
oath by such taxpayer or his or her duly authorized agent, having knowledge of
the facts, setting forth with definiteness and particularity the items of the
assessment objected to, together with the reason for such objections, such
assessment shall become and be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall
be payable at the end of the 30-day period. In every case where a petition for
reassessment as above described is filed, the City Treasurer shall assign a
time and place for the hearing thereof and shall notify the petitioner of such
hearing by written notice at least 20 days in advance thereof and such hearing
shall be held within 60 days from the filing of the petition for reassessment
unless continued by agreement or by the City Treasurer for good cause. The
hearing shall be informal and may be conducted by an examiner designated by the
City Treasurer. At such hearing, evidence may be offered to support the
assessment or to prove that it is incorrect. After such hearing, the City
Treasurer shall, within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of the

the City Treasurer’s decision shall be final.

writing, within 30 days after notice is mailed to him or her by the City
Treasurer, for a hearing and correction of the amount of the tax so assessed
upon him or her by the City Treasurer, in which petition shall be set forth the
reasons why such hearings should be granted and the amount of such tax should
be reduced. Council shall promptly consider such petition, and may grant such
hearing or deny it. If denied, the petitioner shall be forthwith notified
thereof; if granted, Council shall notify the petitioner of the time and place
fixed for such hearing. After such hearing, Council may make such order in the
matter as may appear to it just and lawful, and shall furnish a copy of such
order to the petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any tax required to
be paid by him or her may recover the amount so paid, together with interest,

his or her accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his or her

amount of tax, there shall be added to the amount of the tax unpaid, from the
date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount of 5% of the tax

each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, that if
such failure is due to reasonable cause, the City Treasurer may waive or remit

subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be
added an additional penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax exclusive of
penalties.

because of all business done, within 30 days after selling out his or her
business or stock of goods, or ceasing to do such business.
   (B)   The successor in business of any such person shall withhold so much of
the purchase money as will satisfy the taxes and penalty which may be due until
the former owner shall produce a receipt from the City Treasurer evidencing the
payment of such taxes and penalty. If the purchaser of a business or stock of

manner reducing recidivism. This section applies to any residential rental unit
located within the city. This section shall be construed liberally in order to
achieve the purposes and intent enunciated herein. The provisions of this
section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, methods or processes
otherwise contained in any ordinance or law of the city, county or state. All
city employees meeting the criteria set forth in §
154.004(A) and (B) shall have authority to enforce the provisions of this
section and shall be referred to herein as Code Enforcement Officers.

organization of a hospital, providing housing exclusively for students,

   (C)   Residential rental license required. On July 1, 2020 and thereafter,
it shall be unlawful for any owner to lease or rent, or hold out for rent or
lease by advertisement or otherwise, a rental unit located within the city
without possession of a valid residential rental license for that rental unit,

residential rental license requirement provided for in this section shall be in
addition to any general business license required in this section.
   (D)   Additional application requirements for residential rental license.
The residential rental license provided for in this section shall be in the

38.071 to any owner making proper application on forms to be prescribed and

in an unsafe structure, or three or greater violations have been given the
previous calendar 12 months.

efforts to notify tenants of planned inspections of their rental units to
secure the tenant’s consent. Owner shall also be solely responsible for

notice of the violation to the owner or responsible local agent and shall
specify a reasonable time period in which the violation must be corrected.
Failure to correct violations within the time period specified by the Code
Enforcement Officer may result in an immediate revocation of the residential
rental license for that rental unit and may further subject the owner to the
penalties set forth in §
38.999, and any other penalties permitted under this code. No residential
rental license shall be revoked for failure to remedy a condition, so long as
the owner or responsible local agent is, in the discretion of the Code
Enforcement Officer, acting with due diligence and taking bona fide steps to
correct the violation, including, but not limited to, pursuing remedies under a
lease agreement with a tenant, but not greater than 30 days. These bona fide
steps may include submittal of plans, approved building permits, purchased
materials and/or contractor licenses obtained in anticipation of work to be
completed.
      (2)   Code Enforcement Officers may, in their discretion, perform one or
more re- inspections of a rental unit in which violations have occurred for the

inspection, no re-inspection will be required and no re-inspection fee will be
charged.

that the public utility service was not purchased, used or consumed within the
corporate limits of the city, the seller shall refer the question to the City
Treasurer and such seller shall thereafter collect or refrain from collecting
such tax from such purchaser for such public utility service as instructed in
writing to do by the Treasurer. Any and all claims for refunds of any such tax
shall be presented to the city and not to the seller.

violates any provision of §§
38.001 to
38.032 shall be fined an amount not to exceed state law or imprisoned for a
term not to exceed state law, or both. In addition to the foregoing penalties,

sanctions. Violations of §§
38.070 to
38.086 that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may
be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty
does not prevent injunctive relief. Violations of §§
38.070 to
38.086 shall be adjudicated through the City Municipal Court.
(Prior Code, § 733.99)
   (D)   (1)   Any person willfully violating any of the provisions of §§

38.100 to
38.116. A WILLFUL violation of §§
38.100 to
38.116 requires that the defendant have had knowledge of or notice of a duty to

total amount of delinquent municipal service fees, as well as the fine and
court costs imposed by the court are not paid within 90 days subsequent to when
the City Municipal Court renders its decision, the city shall notify the

MUNICIPAL SERVICE FEES
§ 39.001 COUNCIL FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the Municipal Home Rule Board, under the
authority provided in W. Va. Code 8-1-5a, approved the city’s Home Rule, Phase
II Application which included, among other actions, the request for
authorization to enact an ordinance that:
      (1)   Creates an automatic lien that attaches to all real property
immediately upon the imposition of all city municipal fees respecting such
property;
      (2)   Authorizes the city to foreclose on said property, under applicable
state law respecting foreclosure procedures, without the requirement of going
to Circuit Court;
      (3)   Requires closing agents, attorneys and others, to contact the city
prior to closing any real estate transaction involving real property located
within the city to determine the amount of delinquent fees and that all such
delinquent fees be paid in full from/at closing; and
      (4)   Requires the transferee of real property located within the city to
record the deed to the property with the Clerk of the county in which the
property is located, and that the deed be recorded within 12 months of the date
the transfer occurs.
   (B)   The City Council believes that it is in best interests of the city and
the residents of the city to provide for the uniform imposition and collection
of the municipal service fee.
   (C)   The City Council hereby determines that insofar as some residents
allow the municipal service fee imposed on their respective properties to
become delinquent, the city should take necessary and appropriate actions to
collect those delinquent municipal service fees.
(Ord. 15-, passed 6-2-2015)
§ 39.002 IMPOSITION; RATE.
   (A)   (1)   There is hereby levied and shall be collected a charge against

stated in division (B) below; provided, however, that in accordance with
division (F) below, the foregoing charge for municipal services may be revised
without further amendment to this division (A); provided further, that on and

statement on a quarterly basis to each residence and business to be charged

such statement may be consolidated by the Treasurer with statements for other
municipal fees and services due from such person or business entity. If a
quarterly statement is mailed by the Treasurer, it may be mailed each quarter

persons, $32,150 if four persons, and an additional $5,500 for each additional
person after four persons, the municipal service fee to such single-family
residential unit during the current year shall be reduced to an amount that is
$10 less per month or $30 per quarter than the amount charged for residential
units that do not qualify for the reduced rate; provided, that in order to
qualify for such reduced rate, all of the residents who occupy such single-
family residential unit, and who were employed at any time during the preceding
year, shall join in making an application for such reduced rate to the City
Treasurer and shall file an affidavit providing all relevant facts; provided
however, that all such residents shall attach to the application a copy of each
Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 ES filed by and each Internal Revenue
Service Form W-2 received by each of the residents demonstrating all estimated
income tax payments made and all wages earned during the calendar year
preceding the current year in which application is made; provided further, that

or regulation is erroneous.

provide the requesting party with a written estimated or actual final billing

EMERGENCY SERVICES USER FEE
§ 39.045 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds:
   (A)   The city provides emergency services to residents and non-residents
both within and outside its corporate borders, including non-residents both
within and outside the city’s Fire Service District;
   (B)   Such emergency services include police protection and fire protection;
   (C)   Residents of the city and owners of property located in the city pay
for the emergency services through payment of ad valorem property taxes,
municipal service fees and municipal B&O taxes;
   (D)   Nonresidents of the city who receive the emergency services do not pay
for the emergency services received;
   (E)   The provision of emergency services to nonresidents of the city
results in the temporary removal from the city of scarce resources in the form
of city personnel, city fire and police equipment and city-owned materials;
   (F)   The provision of such emergency services is within the authority of
and is at the direct request of Putnam County 911, Kanawha County 911 or the
State Police;
   (G)   W. Va. Code 8-15-3 authorizes every municipality to enter into a fire
service contract to provide fire protection for property located outside
municipal borders;
   (H)   W. Va. Code 8-15-3 provides the method to calculate the amount of the
annual payment for the provision of the fire protection service under a fire
service contract;
   (I)   Since emergency services other than those emergency services provided
under a fire protection contract are only provided to nonresidents of the city
when directed by either Putnam County 911 or Kanawha County 911, it is
reasonable to derive a portion of the cost of providing and maintaining such
services from the individuals to whom the services are provided;
   (J)   W. Va. Code 8-13-13 provides that every municipality has the plenary
power and authority to provide by ordinance for the installation, continuance,
maintenance or improvement of such emergency services, to make reasonable
regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance upon the users of
such emergency services reasonable rates, fees and charges to be collected in
the manner prescribed in the ordinance;
   (K)   All of those individuals who use, enjoy and benefit from these
emergency services should bear an equitable share of the costs thereof;
   (L)   The imposition of the emergency service user fee established herein is
a reasonable system of distributing the costs to all of the users of the
emergency services;
   (M)   The State Legislature has conferred upon municipalities the plenary
power to enact reasonable administrative provisions to ensure the efficient,
orderly and equitable implementation and collection of the emergency service
user fees from all users;
   (N)   It is in the best interests of the citizens of the city and the users
of emergency services to enact this subchapter to impose an emergency service
user fee;
   (O)   There are many individuals who benefit from emergency services who are
not owners of property or residents of the city; and
   (P)   The fee imposed is reasonable, not excessive, and warranted based upon
a reasonable allocation of the fee payers’ usage of the emergency services
contemplated herein.

sewer connection restored until all service charges, including the expense of
removal, closing and restoration shall have been paid.

required to correct or remedy such violations within a reasonable time, and

used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “go”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under §
71.36, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such
place prohibits either such turn, but vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)   Yellow alone or “caution” when showing following the green or “go”
signal.

or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “stop”
signal is exhibited.

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right-of- way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or “stop” signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or “stop” signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or “stop” signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be

intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.

or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (E)   Application. In the event an official traffic control signal is
erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of
this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their
nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

§ 72.035 OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (A)   A person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under 18 years of age
and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is restrained by
a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. For
the purposes of this section, PASSENGER VEHICLE means a motor vehicle which is
designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including the driver, except
that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or any motor vehicle
which is not required on the date of the enactment of this section under a
federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a belt system. The
provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger vehicles manufactured
after January 1, 1967, and being 1968 models and newer.
   (B)   The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate.
   (C)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages; provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an
in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party’s failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of. Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine that the injured party failed to wear a
safety belt, and that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a failure
to mitigate damages. The trier of fact may reduce the injured party’s recovery
for medical damages by an amount not to exceed 5% thereof. In the event the
plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of 5% of medical damages, the court shall
make the calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to
wear a safety belt shall not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual
computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver’s record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.

   (A)   At every point where the tracks or switches of a railroad company
cross any unpaved public thoroughfare or street, it shall be the duty of the
railroad company to construct proper crossings and approaches thereto on such a
grade that it shall not exceed 2%, and under the direction and in accordance
with plans and surveys made by the City Engineer if so required by Council.
Each of the crossings shall be covered the full width of the street between
curb lines and for ten feet on each side of the tracks with crushed stone of
such strength and size (not to exceed stone that will pass through a two- inch
ring) as may be required by the City Engineer, to a depth of at least 12
inches, but the City Engineer may, if conditions warrant it, allow a less depth
of crushed stone down to six inches deep and a base of coarser stone.
   (B)   The stone filling shall continue to the entire distance on each side
of the railroad tracks to which the original grade of the street was disturbed
in arriving at the new grade for the crossing, in the event the street was
disturbed for a greater length than the ten feet on each side of the track. At
all points for one foot on the outside of each rail and the entire space
between the rails, the entire width of the railway between the curbs and the
ties shall be covered with substantial boards not less than two and one-half
inches thick and not less than six inches wide, except where a narrower board
is necessary to fill out some crack less than six inches wide; and in the event
that there is more than one track on each of such street crossings, then the
whole space between each set of tracks shall be constructed of boards in the
same manner herein provided for the space between the rails. In the event the
rails of the company run parallel with the street and along any part thereof,
the ties between the rails and the space for 18 inches on either side of any
rail shall be covered with boards of the size and construction prescribed for
crossings.
   (C)   All such board filling at crossings and along public streets occupied
by the railroad tracks shall be kept in good repair and condition, securely
spiked down at all times, and no rotten boards, loose ends or split and damaged
boards shall be permitted which in the judgment of the City Engineer might
cause an injury to any animal, vehicle or person traveling along or across the
tracks on the public street.
   (D)   Whenever any street is paved by the city up to a line parallel with
the property line of the railroad company’s right-of-way on both sides of any
railroad crossing, it shall be the duty of the railroad company forthwith to
proceed to pave this crossing the entire distance of its right-of-way with the
same materials and in the same manner that the rest of the street on either
side of the crossing is paved or with other materials to be approved by the
City Engineer.
   (E)    It shall be unlawful for any railroad company to delay the completion
of such work for a longer time than 20 days after the completion of the paving
on both sides of the crossing, such paving to be done according to plans and
specifications and on grades to be approved by the City Engineer and Council.
Council may require any well recognized and reasonable special construction
guards or other devices, along the rails to provide a smooth passage thereover
for vehicles using the crossing. The railroad company shall also keep the
paving on the crossing in good repair and condition at all times.

in §
91.02, he or she shall give notice in writing to the owner, occupant or person
in charge of the premises upon which such condition exists, stating therein the
condition which constitutes a nuisance, and directing such addressee to remedy

collected as city taxes or in any other manner authorized by law for the

any dwellings or other buildings are unfit for human habitation due to

conditions, whether the building is currently occupied or not. Any entrance
upon private premises for the purpose of making examinations to aid in the
enforcement of this section shall be made in such a manner as to cause the
least possible inconvenience to persons in possession; provided, that this
section shall not be construed as purporting to authorize an unreasonable
search and seizure prohibited by § 6, Article III of the State Constitution.

against the landowner or other responsible party for all costs incurred by the
city with respect to the property and for reasonable attorney fees and court
costs incurred in the prosecution of the action.

City Council shall cause a legal advertisement to be published once a week for
three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
wherein the subject property is located and shall post notice on the front door
or other conspicuous location on the subject property.

thereon shall be had within 20 days, or as soon thereafter as possible, and the
court shall enter such final order or decree as the law and justice may
require.

at issue to be forwarded to the Municipal Court Clerk who shall file it as the
original complaint alleging the violation indicated therein.
      (6)   The Municipal Court shall treat the citation itself as the original
complaint before the Court, and shall treat it as prima facie evidence of the
violation alleged therein. At the close of all of the evidence, should the
Municipal Judge find against the alleged violator, the bond posted by the
alleged violator shall be applied as payment for the fine imposed for the
violation. In the event the Municipal Court Judge finds that a violator suffers
from financial hardship, the Municipal Judge may permit alternative sentencing.
Should the Court find in favor of the alleged violator, the bond shall be
refunded to the alleged violator by the Municipal Court Clerk.

an exemption from the requirements of this subchapter in order to allow
sufficient time for installation of needed control equipment, facilities or
modifications to achieve compliance, not to exceed 30 days, provided that such
exemption may be renewed as necessary, but only if satisfactory progress toward

community or for another purpose.
      (3)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Mayor

include all necessary conditions, including time limits on the permitted
activity. The special waiver shall not become effective until all conditions

section, it will be subject to the condition that any such special waiver will
expire at 10:00 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday evening and midnight on Friday

members of color guards, drill teams, lodges and other persons by whom the
display of weapons upon the occasion of such parade or demonstration would not
arouse anxiety on the part of spectators or constitute a threat to the
maintenance of law and order and the preservation of the public peace.

the provisions of this subchapter shall cause or suffer to be caused any

nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to
blight and downgrading the quality of life in adjacent areas.
   (D)   The city finds that the regulation of the location of adults-only
establishments is necessary to prevent undesirable secondary effects on
surrounding areas, including, without limitation, a tendency to attract an
undesirable quantity of transients; to adversely affect real property values;
to cause an increase in crime; to contribute io the blighting of residential
and commercial areas; and to impede the development of businesses and
residences.
   (E)   The city, through enactment of a land use ordinance, desires to
minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the
health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and
character of adjacent areas; and deter the spread of blight.
   (F)   The city, although concerned about these adverse effects, upholds
constitutionally protected speech and expression and does not desire to
infringe on constitutionally protected speech and expression.

only the secondary effects of adults-only establishments within the territorial

§ 134.35 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds:
      (1)   In enacting the state’s Lottery Racetrack Table Games Act, W. Va.
Code Chapter 29, Article 22C, as amended, the State Legislature found that
horse racing and dog racing play a critical role in the economy of this state
and contribute vital revenues to the counties and municipalities in which these
activities take place;
      (2)   In enacting the aforesaid state’s Lottery Racetrack Table Games
Act, the State Legislature found that the operation of state lottery table
games at licensed horse or dog racetracks would protect and preserve the horse
and dog racing industries and protect and enhance the tourism industry in the
state;
      (3)   Dog racing and state table games licensed by this state are
critical to the economy of the city because those activities provide local
jobs, generate critical revenue and enhance local tourism;
      (4)   All of the state licensed racetracks outside of Kanawha County that
possess state lottery table games licenses permit smoking in certain designated
gaming areas;
      (5)   Some destination resort casino patrons, including some patrons
residing outside of the state, smoke and that at least some of those patrons
will not patronize destination resort casinos that do not accommodate smoking;
      (6)   The United States Surgeon General and other credible public health
authorities have determined that the inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke
can cause or contribute to numerous health problems and diseases, including
heart disease, cancer and respiratory illness in nonsmokers;
      (7)   In addressing the public health risk posed by environmental tobacco
smoke, many health authorities, both within and outside of the state, have
concluded that under appropriate circumstances limited smoking in public places
can be accommodated;
      (8)   Local municipal governments are uniquely situated in evaluating the
needs of their local citizens, businesses and communities;
      (9)   Article VI, Sec, 39a of the State Constitution vests the city with
the power to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its municipal affairs;
and
      (10)   The State Legislature has granted cities plenary power and
authority to provide for the government, regulation and control of their
municipal affairs.
   (B)   Therefore, the purpose of this subchapter is to exercise the police
powers of the city with respect to the protection of public health, while
balancing the need to protect and enhance the local economy.

         (b)   When the value of the merchandise exceeds $500, the defendant
shall be fined a sum not to exceed state law and shall be confined in jail for
a term not to exceed state law; and
         (c)   In addition to the fines and imprisonment imposed by this
section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of shoplifting, the court
shall order the defendant to pay a penalty to the mercantile establishment
involved in the amount not to exceed state law, or double the value of the
merchandise involved, whichever is higher. The mercantile establishment shall
be entitled to collect such mandatory penalty as in the case of a civil
judgment. This penalty shall be in addition to the mercantile establishment’s
rights to recover the stolen merchandise.
      (3)   Prior convictions. In determining the number of prior shoplifting
convictions for purposes of imposing punishment under this division (D), the
court shall disregard all such convictions occurring more than seven years
prior to the shoplifting offense in question.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.001 POLICY.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to consider the
subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat as
subject to the control of the city for the orderly, planned, efficient and
economical development of the municipality.
   (B)   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood
or other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until available public
facilities and improvements exist and proper provision has been made for
drainage, water, sewerage and capital improvements such as schools, parks,
recreation facilities, transportation facilities and improvements.
   (C)   The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be
properly related to the proposals shown in the comprehensive plan of the city,
and it is intended that these subdivision regulations shall supplement and
facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in
Building and Housing Codes and zoning ordinances of the city.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.002 PURPOSE.
   These subdivision regulations are adopted for the following purposes:
   (A)   To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general
welfare of the city;
   (B)   To guide the future growth and development of the municipality;
   (C)   To provide for adequate light, air and privacy, to secure safety from
fire, flood and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue
congestion of population;
   (D)   To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all
parts of the city and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development of
all parts of the city;
   (E)   To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the city and the
value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the
conflicts among the uses of land and buildings;
   (F)   To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide
adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks,
playgrounds, recreation and other public requirements and facilities;
   (G)   To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land
and buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the city, having
particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways,
and the pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land
and buildings, and to provide for the proper location and width of streets and
building lines;
   (H)   To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for
subdivisions and resubdivisions, in order to further the orderly layout and use
of land; and to ensure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided
land;
   (I)   To ensure that public facilities are available and will have a
sufficient capacity to serve the proposed subdivision;
   (J)   To prevent the pollution of air, streams and ponds; to assure the
adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table; and to encourage
the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the city in order
to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the community and the value
of the land;
   (K)   To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the city and to
ensure appropriate development with regard to these natural features; and
   (L)   To provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and
layout of the land, including the use of average density in providing for
minimum width and area of lots, while preserving the density of land as
established in the zoning regulations of the city.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.003 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   By authority (resolution, order, zoning regulations) of the Planning
Commission (hereinafter referred to as “Commission”) adopted pursuant to the
powers and jurisdictions vested through W. Va. Code Article 8-24-1 et seq., and
other applicable laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the state, the
Commission does hereby exercise the power and authority to review, approve and
disapprove plats for subdivision land within the corporate limits of the city
which show lots, blocks or sites with or without new streets or highways.
   (B)   By the same authority, the Commission does hereby exercise the power
and authority to pass and approve the development of plat subdivisions of land
already recorded in the office of the County Clerk if such plats are entirely
or partially undeveloped.
   (C)   The plat shall be considered to be entirely or partially undeveloped
if:
      (1)   Such plat has been recorded with the County Clerk’s office without
prior approval by the Commission; or
      (2)   Such plat has been approved by the Commission where the approval
has been granted more than three years prior to granting a building permit, on
the partially or entirely undeveloped land and the zoning regulations, either
bulk or use, for the district in which the subdivision is located, have been
changed subsequent to the original final subdivision approval.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.004 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land,
as defined herein, located within the corporate limits of the city.
   (B)   No land shall be subdivided within the corporate limits of the city
until:
      (1)   The subdivider or his or her agent submits a sketch plat of the
parcel to the Commission;
      (2)   Such subdivider obtains approval of the sketch plat and preliminary
and final approval of the plat itself by the Commission; and
      (3)   The approved plat is filed with the County Clerk.
   (C)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with the
subdivision regulations.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.005 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (A)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these subdivision regulations shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   (B)   Conflict with public and private provisions.
      (1)   Public provisions. The subdivision regulations are not intended to
interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation,
statute or other provisions of law. Where any provision of these subdivision
regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
provision of these subdivision regulations or any other ordinance, rule or
regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
      (2)   Private provisions. These subdivision regulations are not intended
to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or
restriction, provided that where the provisions of these subdivision
regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than
such easement, covenant or other private agreement or restriction, the
requirements of these subdivision regulations shall govern. Where the
provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or restriction impose
duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the
requirements of these subdivision regulations, or the determinations of the
Commission or the city in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these
subdivision regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with
these subdivision regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private
provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these subdivision regulations
and determinations made thereunder.
   (C)   Separability. If any part of the provisions of these subdivision
regulations or application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged
invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined
in its operations to the part, provision or application directly involved in
all controversy in which such judgment has been rendered and shall not affect
or impair the validity of the remainder of these subdivision regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The Commission hereby
declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these subdivision
regulations even without any such part, provision or application.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.006 SAVINGS PROVISION.
   These subdivision regulations shall not be construed as abating any action
now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or
as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the municipality under any section or provision
existing at the time of adoption of these subdivision regulations, or as
vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm or corporation,
by lawful action of the municipality except as shall be expressly provided for
in these subdivision regulations.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.007 RESERVATIONS AND APPEALS.
   Upon the adoption of these subdivision regulations according to law, the
subdivision regulations, adopted as amended, are hereby repealed, except as to
such sections expressly retained herein.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.008 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing the public health, safety and general welfare,
the Commission may from time to time amend the provisions imposed by these
subdivision regulations. Public hearings on all proposed amendments shall be
held by the Commission in manner prescribed by law.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.009 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivisions of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state of this city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the Commission for design, dedication,
improvement and restrictive use of land so as to conform to the physical and
economical development of the city and to the safety and general welfare of the
future plot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.010 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
   (A)   Procedure for resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the
Commission by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.011 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (A)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lots therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
   (B)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Commission in like manner
as plats of subdivisions. Council may reject any such instrument which abridges
or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets
or alleys.
   (C)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded or filed, in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly
recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
   (D)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein
provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of
such writing.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.012 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these subdivision
regulations and/or the purposes of these subdivision regulations may be served
to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variance shall
not have effect of nullifying the intent and purposes of these subdivision
regulations; and further provided the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not approve
variances unless it makes written findings based upon the evidence presented to
it that all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these subdivision regulations is carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning ordinances.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of these subdivision regulations.
   (C)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The petition shall state
fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the
petitioner.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.013 ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The Zoning Officer shall enforce these subdivision regulations and
shall bring to the attention of the City Attorney any violations or lack of
compliance herewith.
      (2)   No owner, or agent of the owner, of any parcel of land located in a
proposed subdivision shall transfer or sell any such parcel before a plat of
the subdivision has been approved by the Commission, in accordance with the
provisions of these subdivision regulations, and filed with the County Clerk.
      (3)   (a)   The subdivision of any lot or any parcel of land, by the use
of metes and bounds description for the purpose of sale, transfer or lease with
the intent of evading these subdivision regulations, shall not be permitted.
         (b)   All such described subdivisions shall be subject to all of the
requirements contained in these subdivision regulations.
      (4)   No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any
building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation
of the provisions of these subdivision regulations.
   (B)   Civil enforcement. Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken by
law or in equity to prevent any violation of these subdivision regulations, to
prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct or
abate a violation, to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or
premises, and these remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described
above.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS
§ 150.025 GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Classification of subdivision. Whenever any subdivision of land is
proposed, before any contract is made for the sale of any part thereof, and
before any permit for the erection of a structure in such proposed subdivision
is granted, the subdividing owner or his or her authorized agent shall apply
for and secure approval of such proposed subdivision in accordance with the
following procedure, which includes basically two steps for a minor subdivision
and three steps for a major subdivision.
      (1)   Minor subdivision:
         (a)   Sketch plat; and
         (b)   Final subdivision plat.
      (2)   Major subdivision:
         (a)   Sketch plat;
         (b)   Preliminary plat; and
         (c)   Final subdivision plat.
   (B)   Official submission dates. For the purpose of these subdivision
regulations, for both major and minor subdivisions, the date of the regular
meeting of the Commission at which the public hearing on final approval of the
subdivision plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, shall
constitute the official submittal date of the plat at which the statutory
period required for formal approval or disapproval of the plat shall commence
to run.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.026 SKETCH PLAT.
   (A)   Discussion of requirements. Before preparing the sketch for a
subdivision, the applicant is encouraged, but not necessarily obligated, to
discuss with the Commission or Zoning Officer the procedure for adoption of a
subdivision plat and the requirements as to general layout of streets and for
reservations of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection
and similar matters, as well as the availability of existing services. The
Commission or Zoning Officer shall also advise the applicant, where
appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision with those officials who must
eventually approve these aspects of the subdivision plat coming within their
jurisdiction. It is the intent of this section that such discussion is
necessary and desirable to advise the applicant of all requirements so that
future problems and questions can be reduced.
   (B)   Application procedure and requirements. Prior to subdividing land, an
owner of the land, or his or her representative, shall file an application for
approval of a sketch plat. The application shall:
      (1)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Zoning Officer;
      (2)   Include all contiguous holdings of the owner including land in the
“same ownership” as defined in §
152.011, with an indication of the portion which is proposed to be subdivided,
accompanied by an affidavit of ownership, which shall include the dates the
respective holdings of land were required, together with the book and page of
each conveyance to the present owner as recorded in the County Clerk’s office.
The affidavit shall advise as to the legal owner of the property, the contract
owner of the property, the date the contract of sale was executed, and, if any
corporations are involved, a complete list of all directors, officers and
stockholders of each corporation owning more than 5% of any class of stock;
      (3)   Be accompanied by a minimum of seven copies of the sketch plat as
described in these subdivision regulations and complying in all aspects with
these subdivision regulations;
      (4)   Be presented to the Zoning Officer in duplicate;
      (5)   Be accompanied by a fee as established by the city; and
      (6)   The application shall include an address and telephone number of an
agent who shall be authorized to receive all notices required by these
subdivision regulations.
   (C)   Classification.
      (1)   Tentative classification of the sketch plat shall be made at this
time by the Commission, as to whether the subdivision is a major or minor
subdivision as defined in these subdivision regulations. Subsequent to
classification of the subdivision, the Commission shall place the matter on the
next available regular meeting agenda of the Commission for formal approval of
the sketch plat.
      (2)   Subsequent to such approval by the Commission, the applicant may
proceed directly with the filing of an application for approval of a final
subdivision plat as provided in these subdivision regulations if classified as
a minor subdivision, and, if classified as a major subdivision, the applicant
shall first file an application for approval of a preliminary plat, as provided
in these subdivision regulations, before filing for final subdivision plat
approval.
   (D)   Study of sketch plat.
      (1)   The Commission shall transmit the sketch plat for review to
appropriate officials or agencies of the city, adjoining counties or
municipalities, school and special districts, and other official bodies as it
deems necessary or as mandated by law, including any review required by
metropolitan, regional or state bodies under applicable state or federal law.
The Commission shall request that all officials and agencies, to whom a request
for review has been made, submit their report to the Commission within twenty
days after receipt of the request. The Commission shall consider all the
reports submitted by the officials and agencies concerning the sketch plat.
      (2)   The Commission shall study the sketch plat, taking into
consideration the requirements of the subdivision regulations and the best use
of the land being subdivided. Particular attention shall be given to the
arrangement, location and width of streets, their relation to the topography of
the land, sewage disposal, drainage, lot sizes and arrangement, the further
development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided.
   (E)   Field trip. After the regular Commission meeting at which the
subdivision is first discussed, the Commission may schedule a field trip to the
site of the proposed subdivision, accompanied by the applicant or his or her
representative. In order to facilitate field inspection and review of the site
of the proposed subdivision, temporary staking along the centerline of all
proposed roads in the subdivision will be required in time for such field trip,
or if impracticable, the Commission shall permit a suitable alternative
procedure.
   (F)   Approval of sketch plat. After reviewing and discussing the sketch
plat and other reports, as submitted by invited agencies and officials, the
Commission shall advise the applicant of the specific changes or additions, if
any, it will require in the layout, and the character and extent of required
improvements and reservations which it will require as a prerequisite to the
approval of the subdivision plat. The Commission may require additional changes
as a result of further study of the subdivision in final form. Such approval
shall constitute authorization to prepare and submit a preliminary plat in the
case of a major subdivision and a final subdivision plat in the case of a minor
subdivision. Such approval or disapproval shall be made by the Planning
Commission within 30 days after receiving the application for approval of a
sketch plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.027 PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   Application procedure and requirements. Based upon the approval of the
Planning Commission of the sketch plat, the applicant should file in duplicate
an application for approval of a preliminary plat. The application shall:
      (1)   Be made on forms available at the office of the Zoning Officer
together with the specified fee;
      (2)   Include all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide and all
land immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or of that directly
opposite thereto, extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite
land, with the names of the owners as shown in the assessor’s files. This
information may be shown on a separate current tax map reproduction from the
Assessor’s office showing the subdivision superimposed thereon;
      (3)   Be accompanied by a minimum of ten copies of the preliminary plat
as described in these subdivision regulations;
      (4)   Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of construction plans
as described in these subdivision regulations;
      (5)   Comply in all respects with the sketch plat as approved; and
      (6)   Be presented to the Commission at least four weeks prior to a
regular meeting of the Commission.
   (B)   Public hearing. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
preliminary plat. Such hearing shall be advertised in the same manner as the
subsequent public hearing on the final subdivision plat. At the time of the
public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that he or she
has notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, each adjacent or
opposite owner of property as indicated on the application for subdivision
approval at least 15 days prior to the public hearing, and that the applicant
has placed four posters provided to him by the Commission on the four closest
public roads in visible locations surrounding the proposed subdivision
property.
   (C)   Preliminary approval. After the Commission has reviewed the
preliminary plat and construction plans, any city recommendations and testimony
and exhibits submitted at the public hearing, the applicant shall be advised of
any required changes and/or additions. The Commission shall approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plat within 30 days after
the date of the regular meeting of the Commission at which the public hearing
on preliminary approval including adjourned date thereof, is closed. One copy
of the proposed preliminary plat shall be returned to the developer with the
date of approval, conditional approval or disapproval and the reasons therefor
accompanying the plat. Before the Commission approves a preliminary plat
showing park reservation or land for other city use proposed to be dedicated to
the local government, the Commission shall obtain approval of the park or land
reservation from Council.
   (D)   Public improvements. The Commission may require that all public
improvements are installed and dedicated prior to the signing of the
subdivision plat by the Chairperson of the Commission. If the Commission does
not require that all public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to
signing of the subdivision plat by the Chairperson of the Commission, the
amount of the bond shall be established by the Commission based upon the
recommendation of the City Engineer, which bond shall be submitted by the
applicant at the time of application for final subdivision plat approval. The
Commission shall require the applicant to indicate on the plat all roads and
public improvements to be dedicated, all special districts for water, fire and
utility improvements which shall be required to be established or extended and
any other special requirements deemed necessary by the Commission.
   (E)   Effective period of preliminary approval. The approval of a
preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year at the end of
which time final approval on the subdivision must have been obtained from the
Commission, although the plat need not yet be signed and filed with the County
Clerk. Any plat not receiving final approval within the period of time set
forth herein shall be null and void, and the developer shall be required to
resubmit a new plat for preliminary approval subject to all new zoning
restrictions and subdivision regulations.
   (F)   Zoning regulations. Every plat shall conform to existing zoning
regulations and subdivision regulations applicable at the time of proposed
final approval, except that any plat which has received preliminary approval
shall be exempt from any subsequent amendments to the zoning regulations
rendering the plat nonconforming as to bulk or use, provided that final
approval is obtained within a one-year period.
   (G)   Grading of site prior to final approval. Subsequent to preliminary
approval, the developer may apply for a topsoil and excavation permit from the
Commission or such other agency or person as the city shall direct, and upon
receipt of such permit may commence construction to the grades and elevations
required by the approved preliminary plat.
   (H)   Model homes. For the purpose of allowing the early construction of
model homes in a subdivision, the Commission in its discretion may permit a
portion of a major subdivision involving no more than two lots to be created in
accordance with the procedures for a minor subdivision, provided such portion
derives access from an existing city, township, county or state highway, and
provided no future road or other improvement is anticipated where such lots are
proposed. The subdivision plat for the minor portion shall be submitted to the
Commission simultaneously with the preliminary plat for the entire major
subdivision. Subsequent to preliminary approval, the model may be constructed,
subject to such additional requirements that the Commission may require.

(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.029 SIGNING AND RECORDING OF PLAT.
   (A)   Signing of plat.
      (1)   When an escrow deposit or bond is required, the Chairperson of the
Commission and the Zoning Officer shall endorse approval on the plat after the
escrow deposit or bond has been approved by Council, and all the conditions of
the resolution pertaining to the plat have been satisfied.
      (2)   When installation of improvements is required, the Chairperson of
the Commission shall endorse approval on the plat after all conditions of the
resolution have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed.
There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been
installed in a manner satisfactory to the city as shown by a certificate signed
by the City Engineer and City Attorney that the necessary dedication of public
lands and improvements has been accomplished.
   (B)   Recording of plat.
      (1)   The Chairperson and Zoning Officer shall sign the tracing cloth or
reproducible Mylar original of the subdivision plat and two sepia prints of the
subdivision plat. The sepia prints shall be returned to the applicant’s
engineer.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file the plat
with the County Clerk’s office within 30 days of the date of signature.
Simultaneously with the filing of the plat, the Zoning Officer shall record the
agreement of dedication together with such legal documents as shall be required
to be recorded by the local government attorney.
   (C)   Sectionalizing major subdivision plats. Prior to granting final
approval of a major subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be
divided into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the
filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly
development of the plat. The Commissioner may require that the performance bond
be in such amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat
to be filed and may defer the remaining required escrow deposit or performance
bond principal amount until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for
filing. The developer may also file irrevocable offers to dedicate streets and
public improvements in the sections offered to be filed and defer filing offers
of dedication for the remaining sections until such sections, subject to any
conditions imposed by the Commission, are granted concurrently with final
approval of the plat. In the event of approval of sectionalizing, the entire
approved subdivision plat including all sections shall be filed within 90 days
after the date of final approval with the City Clerk’s office and such sections
as have been authorized by the Commission shall be filed with the County Clerk.
Such sections shall contain at least 10% of the total number of lots contained
in the approval plat. The approval of all remaining sections not filed with the
County Clerk shall automatically expire unless such sections have been approved
for filing by the Commission, all fees paid, all instruments and offers of
dedication submitted and performance bonds approved and actually filed with the
Recorder of Deeds within three years of the date of final subdivision approval
of the subdivision plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.030 ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Improvements and escrow deposits or performance bond.
      (1)   Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
Chairperson of the Commission, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer, all the street, sanitary and other improvements including lot
improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these
subdivision regulations, specified in the final subdivision plat, and as
approved by the Commission, and to dedicate the same to the city, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements
thus dedicated.
      (2)   Escrow deposits for lot improvements.
         (a)   Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of
the year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot
be performed, the Zoning Inspector may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of
occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety or general welfare
upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the City
Engineer for the cost of such improvements. The performance bond covering such
lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.
         (b)   Procedures on escrow fund. All required improvements for which
escrow moneys have been accepted by the Zoning Officer at the time of issuance
of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the developer within a
period of nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate
of occupancy. In the event that the improvements have not been properly
installed, at the end of the time period, the Zoning Inspector shall give two
weeks’ written notice to the developer requiring him or her to install the
same, and in the event that the same are not installed properly in the
discretion of the Zoning Officer, the Zoning Officer may request the governing
body to authorize the city to proceed to contract out the work for the
installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of
the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for which escrow moneys are being deposited with the Zoning Officer, the
applicant shall obtain and file with the Zoning Officer prior to obtaining the
certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser of the
premises authorizing the Zoning Officer to install the improvements at the end
of the nine-month period in the event that the same have not been duly
installed by the developer.
      (3)   Performance bond.
         (a)   The Planning Commission in its discretion may waive the
requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements
prior to the signing of the subdivision plat, and that, as an alternative, the
applicant post a bond at the time of application for final subdivision approval
in an amount estimated by the Commission as sufficient to secure to the city
the satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the uncompleted
portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all
lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these
subdivision regulations.
         (b)   Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory
requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form
sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth in these subdivision
regulations. The period within which required improvements must be completed
shall be specified by the Planning Commission in the resolution approving the
final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not in
any event exceed two years from date of final approval. Such bond shall be
approved by the city as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to
the governing body. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to
the governing body extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for
a maximum period of one additional year. The city may at any time during the
period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond
upon recommendation of the Commission.
      (4)   Temporary improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Commission and shall maintain
the same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction of
any temporary facility or improvements, the developer shall file with the city
a separate suitable escrow deposit or bond for temporary facilities, which
escrow deposit or bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be
properly constructed, maintained and removed.
      (5)   Cost of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by
the applicant, at his or her expense, without reimbursement by the city or any
improvement district therein.
      (6)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bonds and
contract provisions apply may file in lieu of such contract or bond a certified
resolution or from officers or agencies authorized to act in their behalf,
agreeing to comply with the provisions of this subchapter.
      (7)   Failure to complete improvement. For subdivisions for which no
escrow deposit or performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not
completed within the period specified by the Commission in the resolution
approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those
cases where an escrow deposit or performance bond has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond,
the city may thereupon declare the escrow deposit or bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the escrow deposit or bond is declared to be
in default.
      (8)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be by the city.
The approval by the Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to
constitute or imply the acceptance by the city of any street, easement or park
shown on such plat. The Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
   (B)   Inspection of improvements.
      (1)   General procedure and fees. The Commission shall provide for
inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their
satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the city an inspection fee
of 2% of the amount of the performance bond or the estimated cost of required
improvements, and the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the Chairperson
of the Commission unless such fee has been paid at the time of application.
These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the city and no building
permits or certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If
the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements
have not been constructed in accordance with the city’s construction standards
and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the
improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by an escrow deposit
or performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally
and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications.
      (2)   Release or reduction of performance bond.
         (a)   Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city shall not
accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce a
performance bond, until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating
that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the
applicant’s engineer or surveyor has certified to the City Engineer, through
submission of detailed “as-built” survey plat of the subdivision, indicating
location, dimensions, materials and other information required by the
Commission or City Engineer, that the layout of the line and grade of all
public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision and that a title insurance policy has been furnished to and
approved by the City Attorney indicating that the improvements shall have been
completed, are ready for dedication to the city and are free and clear of any
and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation, the
governing body shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in
accordance with the established procedure.
         (b)   Reduction of escrow deposit or performance bond. An escrow
deposit or performance bond shall be reduced upon actual dedication of public
improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated
bears to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall the
escrow deposit or performance bond be so reduced below 25% of the principal
amount.
   (C)   Maintenance of improvements.
      (1)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of such improvements by the city. If
there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the city,
the city may on 12 hours’ notice plow the street or effect emergency repairs
and charge the same to applicant.
      (2)   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
city, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the City
Engineer and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure
the satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all lot
improvements on the individual subdivided lots for a period of one year after
the date of their acceptance by the city and dedication of same to the local
government.
   (D)   Deferral or waiver of required improvements.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final
approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
      (2)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Commission to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades,
future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for other
reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of the costs of the future
improvements to the city prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the
applicant may post a bond insuring completion of such improvements upon demand
of the local government.
   (E)   Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
      (1)   Where an escrow deposit or performance bond has been required for a
subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision
shall be issued prior to the completion of the improvements and dedication of
same to the local government, as required in the Commission’s final approval of
the subdivision plat.
      (2)   The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment, prior to
the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall at the time of the
dedication submit moneys in escrow to the city in a sum determined by the City
Engineer for the necessary final improvement of the street.
      (3)   No building permit shall be issued for the final 10% of lots in a
subdivision, or if 10% is less than two, for the final two lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by the Commission for the
plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the city.
   (F)   Consumer protection legislation and conflicts of interest statutes.
      (1)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer or his or her authorized agent has violated any federal,
state or local law pertaining to consumer protection of real estate land sales,
promotion or practices, or any applicable conflicts of interest legislation
with respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of the permit or
certificate, until so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   With respect to such lot or parcel of land, in the event a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, it shall be
subject to revocation by the city until so ordered otherwise by a court of
competent jurisdiction, provided that in no event shall the rights of
intervening innocent third parties in possession of a certificate of occupancy
be prejudiced by any such revocation.
      (3)   Any violation of a federal, state or local consumer protection law,
including, but not limited to: the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, being 39
U.S.C. §§ 410 et seq.; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970, being 15
U.S.C. §§ 41 to 58; Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, being 15 U.S.C.
§§ 1701 et seq.; the Truth in Lending Act, being 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq.; the
Uniform Commercial Credit Code; appropriate and applicable state laws, or
conflicts of interest statute, law or regulation shall be deemed a violation of
these subdivision regulations and subject to all of the penalties and
proceedings as set forth herein.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS AND DESIGN

all other applicable laws of the city;
   (C)   The special requirements of these subdivision regulations and any

(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.046 SELF-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS.
   If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by the zoning regulations or these
subdivision regulations, such restrictions or references thereto are required
to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Planning Commission shall
require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Clerk in a form
to be approved by the City Attorney.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.047 MONUMENTS.
   The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision
as required herein and as approved by a registered land surveyor.
   (A)   Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street
intersections, angle points of curve and block corners. They shall be spaced so
as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained wholly
within the street limits.
   (B)   The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in the
field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than 30 inches in length, not
less than four inches square or five inches in diameter, and marked on top with
a cross, brass plug, iron rod or other durable material securely embedded; or
by iron rods or pipes at least 30 inches long and two inches in diameter. These
monuments shall be placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any straight line
and at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve
changes its radius, at all angle points in any line and at all angle points
along the meander line, such points to be not less than 20 feet back from the
bank of any river or stream, except that when such corners or points fall
within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed in
the side line of the street.
   (C)   All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to
in division (B) above shall be monumented in the field by like monuments as
described above. These monuments shall be placed at all block corners, at each
end of all curves, at a point where a river changes its radius and at all angle
points in any line.
   (D)   The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be monumented
in the field by iron pipes at least 30 inches long and seven-eighths inch in
diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 30 inches long. These
monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection of the river or stream

bank of the river or stream.
   (E)   All such monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in
such manner that they will not be removed by frost.
   (F)   All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a
registered land surveyor prior to the time the Commission recommends approval
of the final plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.048 CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
   Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features
which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the developer and approved by the Commission, upon recommendation
of the City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land
conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a
danger.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.049 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these subdivision regulations. The Commission shall have final authority to
designate the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at sketch plat
approval.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.050 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
regulations and health regulations and in providing driveway access to
buildings on such lots from an approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the zoning regulations. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance
with the zoning regulations and these subdivision regulations. In general, side
lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated,
as established in the zoning regulations.
   (C)   Double frontage lots and access to lots.
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
      (2)   Access from major and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary street. Where
driveway access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several
adjoining lots, the Commission may require that such lots be served by a
combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on such
street. Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to
avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterials.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.051 SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
   (A)   Soil preservation and final grading. No certificate of occupancy shall
be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the
approved final subdivision plat and the lot precovered with soil with an
average depth of at least six inches which shall contain no particles over two
inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered
by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or
natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from
residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide
at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover
between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
   (B)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
   (C)   Lawn-grass seed and sod. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less
than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. In the spring, the
seed shall be sown between March 15 and May 15; and in the fall, the seed shall
be sown between August 15 and September 30. The seed shall consist of a maximum
of 10% rye grass by weight and a minimum of 90% of permanent bluegrass and/or
fescue grass by weight. All seed shall have been tested for germination within
one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label
containing the seed analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge
of the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal
residence on the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
respreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between
October 1 and March 15, and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant shall
submit an agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property owner,
with a copy to the Zoning Officer, that respreading of soil and seeding of lawn
will be done during the immediate following planting season as set forth in
this section, and leave a cash escrow for performance in such amount as shall
be determined by the Zoning Inspector. Sod may be used to comply with any
requirement of seeding set forth herein.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.052 DEBRIS AND WASTE.
   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or
other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, and removal of the same shall be required prior to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy on a subdivision. Nor shall any be left or deposited
in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance
bond or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.053 FENCING.
   Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition may exist.
The fences shall be constructed according to standards established by the City
Engineer and shall be noted as to height and material on the final plat. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the fence improvements have been
duly installed.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.054 WATER BODIES AND WATERCOURSES.
   If a tract being subdivided contains a water body or portion thereof, lot
lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body
among the fees to adjacent lots. The Commission may approve an alternative plan
whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water
body is so placed that it will not become a city responsibility. No more than
25% of the minimum area of a lot required under the zoning regulations may be
satisfied by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, of design
approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.055 PERFORMANCE BOND TO INCLUDE LOT IMPROVEMENT.
   (A)   The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion
of all requirements contained in §
150.030 including, but not limited to, soil preservation, final grading, lot
drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing and all
other lot improvements required by the Commission.
   (B)   Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the
expiration of escrow deposit or the performance bond, the city may enforce the
provisions of the bond where the provisions of this section or any other
applicable law, ordinance or regulation have not been complied with.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.056 STREETS AND ROADS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street or:
         (a)   An existing state highway; or
         (b)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the County Clerk’s office. Such street or highway shall be suitably
improved as required by the highway rules, regulations, specifications or
orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under these subdivision
regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these subdivision
regulations.
      (2)   Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved
and conform to the city construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat
approval.
      (3)   Topography and arrangement.
         (a)   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local
roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance.
All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the
building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of
steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these subdivision regulations.
         (b)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way.
         (c)   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
         (d)   Minor and local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (e)   The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not
necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs or
V-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout.
         (f)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Commission such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
         (g)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
      (4)   Blocks.
         (a)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.
         (b)   The lengths, width and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet or 12 times the
minimum lot width required in the zoning district, nor be less than 400 feet in
length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector
streets shall be not less than 1,000 feet in length.
         (c)   In long blocks, the Commission may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide,
may be required by the Commission through the center of blocks more than 800
feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities.
Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be
determined suitable by the Commission for prospective use.
      (5)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission may require
that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
         (a)   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the
rear property line of such lots;
         (b)   A series of cul-de-sacs, V-shaped streets or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial; and/or
         (c)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a planning or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points).
      (6)   Road names. The sketch plat as submitted shall not indicate any
names upon proposed streets. The Commission shall approve the name of all roads
at the time of preliminary approval. The local postmaster shall be consulted by
the Commission prior to rendering its request to the Commission. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the
city so as not to cause confusion. A road which is or is planned as a
continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
      (7)   Road regulatory signs. The applicant shall deposit with the city at
the time of final subdivision approval the sum of $50 for each road sign
required by the City Engineer at all road intersections. The city shall install
all road signs before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence
on the streets approved. Street name signs are to be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of
which to be approved by the City Engineer.
      (8)   Street lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the City
Engineer.
      (9)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be
permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from
adjacent property to such street.
      (10)   Construction of roads and dead-end roads.
         (a)   Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide
for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection or efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T - or L- shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The Commission
may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the
design standards of these subdivision regulations.
         (b)   Dead-end road (permanent). Where a road does not extend the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the
Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be
nearer to such boundary that 50 feet. However, the Commission may require the
reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities,
pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at
the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with city construction
standards and specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more
effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in
general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these
subdivision regulations.
   (B)   Design standards.
      (1)   General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and road-maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, design standards for roads are
hereby required. Road classification shall be determined by the Commission.
      (2)   Road surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and
gutters and shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths
prescribed in these subdivision regulations. All local and minor streets shall
be paved with a concrete pavement of a minimum thickness of seven inches or of
asphaltic concrete or other material of equivalent quality and shall be
provided with an adequate base as determined by accepted engineering practice.
Such surfacing shall be of such character as is suitable for the expected
traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas.
Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains and bridges. All road
pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds
and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications
adopted by the Commission, City Engineer or city and shall be incorporated into
the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat
approval.
      (3)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these subdivision regulations shall be required whenever, due to
topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes.
Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (4)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
         (a)   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: “This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structure hereon
is prohibited.”
         (b)   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (c)   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (5)   Intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an
angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should
be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right
angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall
intersect at anyone point unless specifically approved by the Commission.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (c)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving
a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
         (d)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 2% rate at a distance
of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
         (e)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
         (f)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be 3% or less.
      (6)   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant
without reimbursement from the city. The sharing expense for the construction
of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the
Commission, shall be fixed by special agreement between the city and the
applicant. Such cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the
percentage of his or her land developed and so served.
   (C)   Road dedications and reservations.
      (1)   New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision
boundaries.
      (2)   Widening and realignment of existing roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the comprehensive plan, or zoning
setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall
be required to improve and dedicate at his or her expense such areas for
widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to the full
width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road
purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the
zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the municipality fee
simple or an easement is granted to the city.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.057 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any plat of subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or
flood water runoff channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as
approved by the Commission, and a copy of design computations shall be
submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is
not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than
600 feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are
exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that
point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (B)   Nature of stormwater facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install stormwater facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer. However, in subdivisions
containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall. Inspection
of facilities shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future stormwater disposal by a public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Provisions for
such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond
required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the subdivision regulations.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The City Engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. City drainage studies together with such
other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed
improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the Commission may withhold approval of the subdivision
until provision has been made for the improvement of such potential condition
in such sum as the Commission determines. No subdivision shall be approved
unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse
or facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
which is subject to flooding, the Commission may approve such subdivision
provided that the applicant fills the affected area of such subdivision to an
elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and lots at a minimum of
12 inches above the elevation of the maximum probable flood, as determined by
the City Engineer. The plat of such subdivision shall provide for an overflow
zone along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width which shall be
sufficient in times of high water to contain or move the water, and no fill
shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or
placed therein. The boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to
approval by the City Engineer. Areas of extremely poor drainage should be
discouraged.
      (6)   Floodplain areas. The applicant shall comply with all requirements
of the floodplain regulations of the city.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the
lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will
be adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate
width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights shall be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         (c)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Commission.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such lands or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the number of lots to be utilized for average density procedure nor
for computing the area requirement of any lot.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.058 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or
create a water supply district for the purpose of providing a water supply
system capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection.
      (2)   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the
specifications of the West Virginia Water Company. All water mains shall be at
least six inches in diameter.
      (3)   Water facilities shall be installed in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the West Virginia Water Company and shall conform to the
Design Systems for Public Water Supply Systems (Bulletin EW-99 West Virginia
Department of Health).
      (4)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all
water supply improvements and the boundary lines of proposed districts,
indicating all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the
preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall be included in the
performance bond to be furnished by the developer.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   In low-density zoning districts, in the discretion of the
Commission, if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be
used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision.
Water samples shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Commission.
      (2)   If the Commission requires that a connection to a public water main
be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat received final approval. Performance of cash bonds
may be required to insure compliance.
   (C)   Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions.
Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500
feet of any structure and shall be approved by the applicable protection unit.
To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire
hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply
improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on
the subdivision plat.
   (D)   Separate water systems. Where the public water system of the city is
not accessible to the subdivider, the subdivider shall install adequate
separate water facilities. In those cases where a separate water facility has
been installed and where such system has been approved by the Commission and
the Municipal Utility Commission of the city, such system shall be dedicated to
the Municipal Utility Commission of the city who shall be responsible for its
continued maintenance and operation.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.059 SEWERAGE RATES.
   (A)   General requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the city construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations and standards of the Municipal Utility Commission of the City
Health Department and other appropriate agency. Plans shall be approved by the
above agencies. Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or
create a sanitary sewer district for the purpose of providing sewerage
facilities to the subdivision, where no district exists for the land to be
subdivided.
   (B)   Residential and nonresidential districts. Sanitary sewerage facilities
shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems. Sewers shall be installed
to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by approving officials and
agencies. No individual disposal system or treatment plants (private or group
disposal systems) shall be permitted. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including
the installation of arterials in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the
specifications, rules, regulations and guidelines of the Health Officer, City
Engineer and appropriate state agency.
   (C)   Residential districts. Sanitary sewerage systems shall be constructed
as follows:
      (1)   Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible,
the applicant shall connect with same and provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision;
      (2)   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably
accessible but will become available within a reasonable time (not to exceed 15
years), the applicant may choose the following alternative: central sewerage
system, the maintenance cost to be assessed against each property benefitted.
Where plans for future public sanitary sewerage systems exist, the applicant
shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains to be in permanent
conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such public sewer
mains; or
      (3)   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will
not become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant may
install sewerage systems as follows.
         (a)   Residential districts. A central sewerage system only. No
individual disposal system shall be permitted. Where plans exist for a public
sewer system to be built, for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant
shall install all sewer lines, laterals and mains to be in permanent
conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such public sewer main.
         (b)   Residential district. Individual disposal systems or central
sewerage systems shall be used.
   (D)   Dedication to Municipal Utility Commission. In those cases where
individual or separate sewerage systems are allowed, the system once approved
by the Commission and Municipal Utility Commission of the city shall be
dedicated to the Municipal Utility Commission of the city who shall be
responsible for its continued maintenance and operation. Such system shall
become a part of the sanitary sewerage system of the city.
   (E)   Mandatory connection to public sewer system. If a public sanitary
sewer is accessible and a sanitary sewer is placed in a street or alley
abutting upon property, the owner thereof shall be required to connect to such
sewer for the purpose of disposing of waste, and no owner or occupant shall
maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system.
   (F)   Design criteria for sanitary sewers.
      (1)   Deviations. These design criteria are not intended to cover
extraordinary situations. Deviations shall be allowed and may be required in
those instances where considered justified by the Municipal Utility Commission
of the city.
      (2)   Design factors. Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the
ultimate tributary population. Due consideration should be given to current
zoning regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where applicable.
   (G)   Design standards for sanitary sewers.
      (1)   Sanitary sewers systems shall be installed according to the rules
and regulations of the Municipal Utility Commission of the city as found in the
following design manuals:
         (a)   Permit Procedures and Design Requirements for Small Sewage and
Water Systems, West Virginia Department of Health; and
         (b)   Recommended Standards for Sewage Works (Policies for the Review
and Approval of Plans and Specifications for Sewage Collection and Treatment; a
Report of the Committee of the Great Lakes Upper Mississippi River Board of
State Sanitary Engineers), commonly known as “10 State Standard”.
      (2)   All construction plans for sanitary sewer installation shall be
reviewed and approved by the Municipal Utility Commission of the city.

      (2)   Concrete curbs are required for all roads where sidewalks are
required by these subdivision regulations or where required in the discretion
of the Commission.
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be improved as required in these subdivision
regulations. A median strip of grassy or landscaped areas at least two feet
wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs.
   (B)   Pedestrian accesses. The Commission may require, in order to
facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds or
other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.061 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location. All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas,
electric, power, telephone and CATV cables, shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing utility facilities are located
aboveground, except where existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they
shall be removed and placed underground. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the
Commission, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived
in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended
to be developed for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1) Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities
(private and municipal); such easements shall be at least ten feet wide. Proper
coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable
utility companies for the establishment of utility easements established in
adjoining properties.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. Easements
shall be indicated on the plat.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.062 PUBLIC USES.
   (A)   Parks, playgrounds and recreation areas.
      (1)   Recreation standards. The Commission shall require that land be
reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreation purposes in locations
designated on the comprehensive plan or otherwise where such reservations would
be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography and general character and shall have adequate road access, for the
particular purposes envisioned by the Commission. The area shall be shown and
marked on the plat, “Reserved for Park and/or Recreation Purposes”. When
recreation areas are required, the Commission shall determine the number of
acres to be reserved on the basis of providing three acres of recreation area
for every 100 dwelling units. The Commission may refer such proposed
reservations to the city official or department in charge of parks and
recreation for recommendation.
         (a)   The developer shall dedicate all such recreation areas to the
local government as a condition of final subdivision plat approval.
         (b)   Multi-family and high-density residential: the Planning
Commission shall determine the acreage for reservation based on the number of
dwelling units per acre to occupy the site as permitted by the zoning
regulations.
      (2)   Minimum size of park and playground reservations. In no case shall
an area of less than two acres be reserved for recreation purposes if it will
be impractical or impossible to secure additional lands in order to increase
its area.
      (3)   Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a character and location suitable for use as a playground, playfield or for
other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively level and dry; and shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Commission, which
improvements shall be included in the performance bond. A recreation site shall
have a total frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet, and no other
dimension of the site shall be less than 200 feet in depth. The Commission may
refer any subdivision proposed to contain a dedicated park to the city official
or department in charge of parks and recreation for a recommendation. All lands
to be reserved for dedication to the city for park purposes shall have prior
approval of the city and shall be shown marked on the plat “Reserved for Park
and/or Recreation Purposes”.
      (4)   Alternative procedure; money in lieu of land. Where, with respect
to a particular subdivision, the reservation of land required pursuant to this
section does not equal the minimum requirement of this section, the Commission
shall require, prior to final approval of the subdivision plat, that the
applicant deposit with the city a cash payment in lieu of land reservation.
Such deposit shall be placed in a Neighborhood Park and Recreation Improvement
Fund to be established by the city. Such deposit shall be used by the City for
improvement of a neighborhood park, playground or recreation area including the
acquisition of property. Such deposit shall be used for facilities that will be
actually available to and benefit the persons in such subdivision and be
located in the general neighborhood of the subdivision. The Commission shall
determine the amount to be deposited, based on the following formula: $200
multiplied by the number of times the total area of the subdivision is
divisible by the required minimum lot size of the zoning district in which it
is located, less a credit for the amount of land actually reserved for
recreation purposes, if any, as the land reserved bears in proportion to the
land required for reservation in division (A)(1) above, but not including any
lands reserved through density zoning.
      (5)   Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. Divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above shall be construed as
prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation purposes in
addition to the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Other public uses.
      (1)   Plat to provide for public uses. Except when an applicant utilizes
planned unit development in which land is set aside by the developer as
required by the provision of the zoning regulations, whenever a tract to be
subdivided includes a school, recreation uses (in excess of the requirements of
division (A)(1) hereof), or other public use as indicated on the master plan or
any portion thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant
into his or her sketch plat. After proper determination of its necessity by the
Commission and the appropriate city official or other public agency involved in
the acquisition and use of each such site and a determination has been made to
acquire the site by the public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated
by the applicant into the preliminary and final plats.
      (2)   Referral to public body. The Commission shall refer the sketch plat
to the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration and report.
The Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow
the public body or agency 30 days for reply. The agency’s recommendation, if
affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel
to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the
acquisition.
      (3)   Notice of property owner. Upon a receipt of an affirmative report,
the Commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the
preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public
body.
      (4)   Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within 12 months of
notification, in writing, from the owner that he or she intends to develop the
land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plat of the
proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the
part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed 12
months shall result in the removal of the “reserved” designation from the
property involved and the freeing of the property for development in accordance
with these subdivision regulations.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.063 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (A)   General. Existing features which would add value to residential
development or to the local government as a whole, such as trees, as herein
defined, watercourses and falls, historic spots and similar irreplaceable
assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be
removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land effected until
approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat
required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where required shall
be welled and protected against change of grade. The sketch plat shall show the
number and location of existing trees, as required by these subdivision
regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for retention, and the
location of all proposed shade trees required along the street side of each lot
as required by these subdivision regulations.
   (B)   Shade trees planted by developer.
      (1)   As a requirement of subdivision approval, the applicant shall plant
shade trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to be planted
within five feet of the right-of-way of the road or roads within and abutting
the subdivision, or, at the discretion of the Commission, within the right-of-
way of such roads. One tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage
along each road unless the Commission, upon recommendation of the City
Engineer, shall grant a waiver. Such waiver shall be granted only if there are
trees growing along such right-of-way or on the abutting property which in the
opinion of the Commission comply with these subdivision regulations.
      (2)   New trees to be provided pursuant to these subdivision regulations
shall be approved by the City Engineer and shall be planted in accordance with
the regulations of the City Engineer. Such trees shall have a minimum trunk
diameter (measured 12 inches above ground level) of not less than two inches.
Only oak, honey locust, hard maples, ginkgo or other long-lived shade trees,
acceptable to the City Engineer and to the Commission, shall be planted.
   (C)   Shade tree easement and dedication. The preliminary plat and final
plat shall reserve an easement authorizing the city to plant shade trees within
five feet of the required right-of-way of the city. No street shall be accepted
for dedication until the City Engineer shall inform the Commission and the city
that compliance, where necessary, has been made with these subdivision
regulations.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 150.064 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Commission may require.
      (2)   A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the
requirements of site plan approval set forth in the zoning regulations. Site
plan approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed
simultaneously at the discretion of the Commission. A nonresidential
subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these subdivision
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Commission.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
subdivision regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all
subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically
adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the
vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and stormwater
drainage.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      (6)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.

PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION
§ 152.001 TITLE, PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the “City of Nitro, West
Virginia Planning and Zoning Ordinance”.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the health,
property and public welfare by controlling the design, location, use or
occupancy of all buildings and structures through the regulated and orderly
development of land and land uses within this jurisdiction.
   (C)   Scope. This chapter shall apply to the construction, addition,
alteration, moving, repair and use of any building, structure, parcel of land
or sign within the city, unless otherwise excepted.
      (1)   Where, in any specific case, different sections of this chapter
specify different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern. Where there
is conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the
specific requirement shall govern.
      (2)   In fulfilling these purposes, this chapter is intended to benefit
the public as a whole and not any specific person or class of persons. Although
through the implementation, administration and enforcement of this chapter,
benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals,
those results are merely a by-product of the overall benefit to the whole
community. Therefore, unintentional breaches of the obligations of
administration and enforcement imposed on the city by this chapter shall not be
enforceable in tort.
      (3)   If any portion of this chapter is held invalid for any reason, the
remaining herein shall not be affected.

location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of
the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is
classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established
by this chapter. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and
permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be
necessary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they
provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as
to their proper location to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the
planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and
operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of
this chapter.

professional engineer or that he or she is registered under W. Va. Code Chapter
30, Article 13 or who holds himself or herself out as able to perform, or who
performs any engineering service or work or any other service designated by the
practitioner which is recognized as engineering, is considered to practice or
offer to PRACTICE ENGINEERING within the meaning and intent of W. Va. Code
Chapter 30, Article 13.
      PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. Where at least 51% of the actual cash value of
a structure, less land value, is above ground.
      REASONABLY SAFE FROM FLOODING. Base flood waters will not inundate the
land or damage structures to be removed from the special flood hazard area and
that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing
or proposed buildings.
      RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:

temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel or seasonal use.
      REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person who has been duly registered
or licensed as a registered professional engineer by the state’s Board of
Registration for Professional Engineers as required under W. Va. Code Chapter
30, Article 13 et seq.
      REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with the requirements of this chapter or, if full compliance is not
possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the non-compliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
      START OF CONSTRUCTION. (The definition for start of construction is to be
used only when calculating the starting time of the six-month expiration of a
permit.) The date the permit was issued, including permits for substantial
improvement or substantial damage, provided the actual START of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual START means
either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an
alteration, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      STATE COORDINATING OFFICE. The state’s Division of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management.
      STREAM. As defined in W. Va. Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse, whether
natural or human-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of their
size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of
its volume.
      STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. See SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. 
         (a)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
         (b)   This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, as defined herein, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         (c)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT, as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         (d)   For the purpose of this definition, IMPROVEMENT is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      TOP OF BANK. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of
a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field, a professional familiar with
fluvial geomorphology should document the TOP OF BANK. When a professional is
not employed, the TOP OF THE BANK will be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
      VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 153.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (A)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the city
which are subject to the 100-year flood, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM), and described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the
city by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated February 8, 2007
or the most recent revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the
city which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the city by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on the city’s local flood hazards
map. These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of technical
data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (B)   Descriptions of floodplain areas. The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas.
      (1)   The Floodway Area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in division (D) below.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe Area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific 100-year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but which lie
beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated Area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM or floodway map included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (C)   Changes in designation of area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the city where natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed
studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a River
Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual document the necessity
for such changes. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained
from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   The city may identify and regulate new flood hazard or ponding
areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived technical
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data.
   (D)   Elevations prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the base flood elevation
specified in the flood insurance study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in §
153.06. Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by
the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to apply for a Letter of
Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the special flood hazard area
designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the base flood elevation specified in the flood insurance study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the city. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Prior Code, § 1733.03) (Ord. 07-05, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 153.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (A)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new- construction, substantial improvements, repair of substantial damage or
other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters, the floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         (a)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below,
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         (b)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative, the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         (c)   All permitted uses, activities and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
   (B)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4), any
development and/or use of land shall be permitted, provided that all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   In the Approximated Floodplain (F4), the Floodplain Manager shall
review, or shall cause to be reviewed, proposed development less than ten lots
or two acres to ascertain the specific flood risk at the building site and
assign a “minimal, moderate or significant” risk level.
         (a)   Development determined to represent a minimal risk and costing
less than $10,000 shall be required to provide “Point on Boundary” elevation
data and historic flood heights. The Floodplain Manager shall attempt to
determine a height that will be reasonably safe from flooding using this
elevation data. The Floodplain Manager shall enter the flood height in Section
“G” of the elevation certificate. Any new or substantially improved structures
using the “point on boundary” method (other than appurtenant structures) shall
be required to have the lowest floor elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade even if the collected elevation data would indicate a
lower flood elevation. If this method is not adequate to allow the Floodplain
Manager to confidently determine the flood height, the applicant shall be
required to utilize one of the methods set forth below.
         (b)   Development determined to represent a low to moderate risk and/
or costing less than $30,000 shall provide Quick-2 engineering data prepared by
a registered professional engineer or obtain free LOMA data from FEMA. This
semi-detailed method will be used by the Floodplain Manager to determine a
“Community Flood Elevation”. The Floodplain Manager shall enter the community
flood elevations in Section “G” of the elevation certificate.
         (c)   Development determined to represent a high risk and/or costing
more than $30,000 shall be required to develop a base flood elevation using a
detailed method such as HEC-ras. This data shall be prepared and certified by a
registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms and a completed elevation certificate.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Manager. Base flood elevations determined using this method can be used to rate
flood insurance, typically resulting in a reduced premium.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place, either fully or partially, within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten lots or two acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         (a)   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         (b)   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (C)   AE area without floodway (F3). Within any AE Area without Floodway, no
new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
through a hydrologic and hydraulic study that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of the
floodway area where determined.
   (D)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area, the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the city, Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating Office and any
adjacent communities of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or
relocation of the stream. Copies of all required notifications must be
submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration. In addition prior to issuing
the local permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all
necessary permits from those governmental agencies from which federal or state
law requires approval. Contact information for state and federal permitting
authorities as well as addresses for required notification of appropriate
county, state and federal government agencies are contained in the city’s
stream alteration administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the city in writing that the
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
“best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
chapter.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses, including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement when the land associated with the watercourse alteration is
transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
153.99.
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the flood
insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
(Prior Code, § 1733.04) (Ord. 07-05, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 153.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   General. Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified floodplain, floodway or other flood hazard
area;
      (2)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Constructed with material and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage as outlined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) or the most
recent revision thereof;
      (4)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
and
      (5)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (B)   Basic format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant;
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed construction is
to occur;
      (3)   Names, addresses and valid West Virginia license numbers of all
contractors working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is
being performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing as set forth in
W. Va. Code 30-42-6 or state regulations or the most recent revision thereof;
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the project,
including tax map and parcel number;
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow;
      (6)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in §
153.07(I);
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow community
officials access to the development to inspect for compliance; and
      (8)   The contract required by West Virginia Code of State Regulations,
Title 28, Series 4, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall be presented to
the Floodplain Administrator for review. Any amendments or addendums to this
contract shall be presented within five business days of signing. The community
does not require and will not keep copies of the contracts. Failure to present
a contract or an amendment or addendum for review shall void the permit. If a
licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is of an aggregate value of
less than $10,000 including materials and labor, a brief written description of
proposed work and the estimated value will suffice.
   (C)   Elevation and flood-proofing information.
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this chapter.
      (2)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following
information shall also be included in the application for work within the
floodplain area;
         (a)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation:
            1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer, surveyor or architect;
            3.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure,
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures and the like. When required by the
Floodplain Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall
prepare these plans;
            4.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas and the like) from flooding to two feet
above the base flood elevation at the building site;
            5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic
elements of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical
construction, it is highly recommended that the applicant obtain elevation data
completed by a licensed surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor; and
            6.   A nonconversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a nonconforming use (generally areas below base flood elevation
with ceilings higher than five feet). This agreement shall state:
               a.   The area below base flood elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this chapter; and
               b.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
153.99.
         (b)   For structures to be flood-proofed to two feet above the base
flood elevation (nonresidential structures only): all applicants are encouraged
to exceed the minimum flood-proofing requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the level of flood-
proofing above the height required by this chapter. In order to obtain an
“elevation credited” flood insurance rate on dry flood-proofed buildings,
flood-proofing must extend at least one foot above the base flood elevation:
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood-proofing measures, prepared
by a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor and flood-proofing limits,
certified by a registered professional engineer, surveyor or architect; and
            3.   A flood-proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (C)(2)(b)1. above, stating the structure in question, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
               a.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the base flood elevation; and
               b.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures and other factors associated with the base flood.
         (c)   Appurtenant structures, structures constructed of flood
resistant materials and used solely for parking of vehicles or storage:
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood-proofing measures and
showing the size of the proposed structure and its relation to the lot where it
is to be constructed;
            2.   A completed elevation certificate showing elevation of
existing ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor; and
            3.   The Floodplain Manager shall prepare, or shall cause to be
prepared, certification confirming that the appurtenant structure, together
with attendant utilities is designed so that:
               a.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the base flood elevation;
               b.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  i.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
                  ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade; and
                  iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
               c.   The applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement and
notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to any
new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the transferred
non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
153.99.
   (D)   Site plan criteria. The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including subdivisions and manufactured home parks, shall submit a
preliminary site plan to the Floodplain Administrator that includes the
following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, surveyor or other
qualified person responsible for providing the information required in this
section;
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to the town’s floodplain areas, proposed lots sites
and fills. In addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other
proposed new developments which are proposed to take place either fully or
partially within the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater that
ten lots or two acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood
elevation data. If FEMA has completed a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), that data
must be used to substantiate the base flood. Otherwise, the developer may
submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
state and local water resource departments, or technical data developed using
detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a flood insurance
study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional
engineer, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts;
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas; and
      (4)   Where the subdivision lies partially in the floodplain area and all
proposed development will take place on natural grade a significant vertical
distance above the floodplain area, development of detailed base flood
elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan for the
proposed development must clearly delineate the area to be developed and the
location of the floodplain areas as depicted on the FEMA map. A registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site
plan.
   (E)   Restrictions to subdivision of land in floodplain areas. Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than one foot below
the elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. All new structures
must be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of
the identified flood hazard area.
(Prior Code, § 1733.05) (Ord. 07-05, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 153.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings, structures and related
utilities and facilities, the following restrictions apply to all development,
subdivision proposals, manufactured home parks, new construction and to
construction of substantial improvements, and the repair of substantial damage,
to existing structures occurring in the floodplain area.
   (A)   Basements and lowest floors.
      (1)   All new construction, relocation and substantial improvements,
including repair of substantial damage, of residential structures must have the
lowest floor, including basement, ductwork and utilities, elevated to two feet
above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   All new construction, relocation, substantial improvements,
including repair of substantial damage, of nonresidential structures must have
the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork and utilities, elevated to two
feet above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is water tight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation.
      (3)   For all new construction, relocation, substantial improvements and
repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (B)   Manufactured home placement. All manufactured homes to be installed or
substantially improved within the identified flood hazard areas of city shall
be installed by a contractor possessing a valid West Virginia Manufactured Home
Installer’s License. Contractors shall install in accordance with the following
standards.
      (1)   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities, including HVAC/heat pump,
shall be elevated two feet above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for use in
a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating dry stacked block piers
shall not be used in flood hazard areas.
      (3)   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to the permanent
foundation in compliance with the requirements of 42 West Virginia Code of
State Regulations, Series 19 Sections 10A.1, 10A.2 and 10A2.b as authorized by
W. Va. Code 21-9-4. The anchoring shall be adequate to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, the over-the-top and frame ties, attached to permanent foundation
elements. Ground anchors are not adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring
requirements. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (4)   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored.
      (5)   A contractor possessing a valid state Manufactured Home Installer’s
License shall certify in writing that the manufactured home has been installed
to the standards set forth above.
   (C)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(2) below, appurtenant structures
shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet above the
base flood elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the base flood elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         (a)   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000;
         (b)   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side;
         (c)   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
         (d)   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
         (e)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation;
         (f)   Machinery, electric devices or appliances and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the base flood elevation; and
         (g)   The venting requirements contained in division (A) above are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A nonconversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
chapter. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
153.99.
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is READY FOR HIGHWAY use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
chapter.
   (E)   Fill.
      (1)   The city officially recognizes the beneficial functions the
floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods. The
city also finds that placement of fill in floodplains can have undesirable and
detrimental effects on velocity, erosion and sedimentation rates causing
increased flooding. (No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.)
      (2)   Placement of fill in other floodplain areas is restricted to
functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Placement of fill to dispose
of spoil from excavation or to elevate yards, parking lots or fields will not
generally be considered a functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the developer to provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the following
standards.
         (a)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The city may require the applicant to
demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would not adversely
affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
city. During permit review, the community shall consider the following issues
that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights;
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property;
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures;
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems; or
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property,
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography, stream
blockages and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required in division (F) below. For nonresidential structures, fill
shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use. At grade access,
with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond the building line, shall be
provided to a minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         (e)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted, no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         (f)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         (g)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (h)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         (i)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures. All buildings and structures shall be
constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon
the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on
the same flood- flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All buildings and structures, including stream crossings, shall be
firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to prevent
flotation, collapse and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to life and
property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and
other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below
the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this division (H).
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the flood
protection setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the flood
protection setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive or, in times of
flooding, could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below base flood elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this chapter, material that resembles “fill” material
shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems, whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.

(Prior Code, § 1733.07) (Ord. 07-05, passed 12-18-2007) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.08 APPEALS.
   (A)   Generally. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this chapter, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the City Council which shall be known as
the Appeals Authority. Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within 30 days
after notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals
Authority shall set a time and place not less than ten nor more than 45 days
for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be
heard. The determination by the Appeals Authority shall be final in all cases.
   (B)   Appeal review criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement or the
freeboard requirements may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Authority.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this chapter
shall adhere to the following criteria.
         (a)   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals
Authority upon: a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and a determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances or cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         (b)   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         (c)   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         (d)   The Appeals Authority shall notify the applicant in writing over
the signature of a community official that the issuance of a decision to allow
construction of a structure below the base flood elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, such construction below the base
flood elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications shall
be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in division (B)(2)(e)
below; and
         (e)   The Appeals Authority shall maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and report such decisions issued in
its biannual report to the Federal Insurance Administration.
         (f)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the base flood elevation.

   The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or development plan in
an identified flood- prone area shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city, or by any official or employee
thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and shall create

§ 154.004 DEPARTMENT OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE INSPECTION AND PROPERTY
MAINTENANCE ADVISORY BOARD CREATED.
   (A)   The Department of Property Maintenance Inspection is hereby created
and the executive official in charge thereof shall be known as the Property
Maintenance Inspector.
      (1)   Appointment. The Property Maintenance Inspector shall be appointed
by the Mayor with the consent of the City Council. The Property Maintenance
Inspector shall not be removed from office except for cause and after full
opportunity to be heard on specific and relevant charges by and before the
appointing authority. The Property Maintenance Inspector shall be supervised by
the Code Official.
      (2)   Deputies. In accordance with the prescribed procedures of the city
and with the concurrence of the Mayor and the City Council, the Property
Maintenance Inspector shall have the authority to appoint a Deputy Property
Maintenance Inspector, other related technical officers, inspectors and other
employees.
      (3)   Liability.
         (a)   The Property Maintenance Inspector, and the employees of that
office, while acting for the city, shall not thereby be rendered liable
personally, and are hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage
accruing to persons or property as a result of an act required or permitted in
the discharge of official duties.
         (b)   Any suit instituted against any officer or employee because of
an act performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties
and under the provisions of this chapter shall be defended by the legal
representative of the city until the final termination of the proceedings. The
Property Maintenance Inspector or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs
in an action, suit or proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the
provisions of this chapter; and any officer of the Department of Property
Maintenance Inspection, acting in good faith and without malice, shall be free
from liability for acts performed under any of its provisions or by reason of
any act or omission in the performance of official duties in connection
therewith.
      (4)   Property maintenance fee. There is hereby imposed a property
maintenance fee for activities and services performed by the Department in
carrying out the property owner’s responsibilities under this chapter;
provided, that the Department shall give ten days’ notice in the manner
prescribed in §
154.008(B) and (C) to the property owner in advance of performing the property
owner’s responsibilities. The property maintenance fee shall be $250 per hour
or part thereof plus the amount of any fine imposed under §
154.999 to perform or carry out a specific activity or service under the
authority of this chapter; provided, that on and after September 16, 2013, the
property maintenance fee shall be $100 per hour or part thereof for each
employee of the city directed to perform or carry out a specific activity or
service under the authority of this subchapter, $200 for each piece of
equipment used to perform or carry out such activity or service, and,
additionally, the amount of any fine imposed under §
154.999. The property maintenance fee hereby imposed shall be due and payable
no later than seven days after the service or activity occurs.
         (a)   Failure to pay the fee creates a lien. If the property
maintenance fee is not paid within seven days after it is due, the amount shall
be in default and may be recovered by the city in any appropriate action. The
property maintenance fee shall, if not paid when due, constitute a lien upon
the premises served, which lien may be foreclosed against the lot or parcel of
land on which the building is located in accordance with state law relating to
the foreclosure of liens on real property. The city shall file semi-annually in
the office of the County Clerk of the county wherein the property is located a
statement of all unpaid property maintenance fees and liens, executed on its
behalf and duly verified by the City Treasurer, showing the kind and nature of
the service, the period covered, the amount of the charges due and unpaid for a
period of more than 90 days, the description or designation of the premises to
which services are chargeable and the name of the property owner, and further
showing an additional fee of $10 to reimburse the city for its costs in
preparing such statement and the additional item of $11 to reimburse the city
for the fee paid by it to the County Clerk for the recordation of such lien
statement, which statement when so filed of record shall be and constitute
notice of a first and prior lien upon the property.
         (b)   Release of lien filed for failure to pay property maintenance
fee.
            1.   Whenever the amount of any lien filed in accordance with this
subchapter has been paid, together with costs, in full to the City Treasurer,
the City Treasurer shall certify such payment to the Mayor, who shall execute
and deliver to the party paying the lien a release of the lien, which may be
recorded in the office of the County Clerk as other releases of liens.
            2.   The Mayor is authorized to issue a release of any such lien
which may have been filed by mistake against the wrong property, upon evidence
of such mistake being presented to the Mayor by the City Treasurer.
         (c)   Unpaid property maintenance fee collected when property
transferred. If the property maintenance fee imposed under this subchapter is
delinquent and the property is transferred from the record owner to another
person, the amount of such property maintenance fee shall be collected from the
transferor at the time of the transfer and the amount so collected shall be
paid to the City Treasurer.
   (B)   Property Maintenance Advisory Board created. The Property Maintenance
Advisory Board is hereby created.
      (1)   Membership. The membership of the Property Maintenance Advisory
Board shall be comprised of the city officials, or their respective designee:
Mayor; the City Recorder; the Code Official; the Property Maintenance
Inspector; the Fire Chief; the Police Chief; the Director of the Public Works
Department; and two members of the City Council appointed by the Mayor.
      (2)   Duties. The Property Maintenance Advisory Board shall meet at least
once each month to review complaints submitted by residents of the city, and to
provide general assistance and guidance to the Property Maintenance Inspector.
The City Recorder shall take complete minutes of each meeting, such minutes to

thereof; and to designate requirements applicable because of local climatic or
other conditions.
      (2)   The Property Maintenance Inspector shall not have the authority to
waive any structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided for
in this chapter, or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public
safety.
   (C)   Inspections. The Property Maintenance Inspector shall make all of the
required inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved
agencies or individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing
and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the
responsible individual. The Property Maintenance Inspector is authorized to
engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical
issues that arise, subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
   (D)   Right of entry. The Property Maintenance Inspector is authorized to

and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the owners and
occupants of the structure shall not be subjected to visits by numerous
inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector from any
agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some provision
of some law, code or subchapter not within the inspector’s authority to
enforce, the inspector shall report the findings to the Property Maintenance
Inspector having jurisdiction.

compliance with the intent and purpose of this chapter, and that such
modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety requirements. The
details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the
Department files.
