section shall be applicable to real property located within the municipal
corporate limits and related unpaid and delinquent fire, police, or street
fees.
      (2)   This section shall be applicable and enforceable as to all unpaid
user fees, related collection costs, late fees, attorney fees, penalties, and
interest, outstanding as of the date of filing and accrued thereafter; provided
however, all amounts already outstanding from fiscal years prior to the year in
which this section is enacted, shall be subject to the notice requirements set
out herein below.
   (B)   Administrative procedure for the collection of user fees pursuant to
lien.
      (1)   Prior to the filing of said lien, the Town Treasurer or the Town
Clerk shall give written notice to the property owner and user, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, that the municipality will file the lien upon
real property owned by the user or subject property owner, unless the
delinquency is paid prior to a date specifically stated in the notice. Said
date must be no less than 90 days from the date the notice is mailed. Notice of
this procedure shall accompany said notice of lien.
      (2)   Within ten calendar days of receipt of the notice required herein
above, the property owner or user shall deliver a written request to the Town
Clerk requesting a conference with the Town Treasurer or Treasurer’s designee,
to discuss any alleged impropriety of the assessment of said fee as to the user
or property owner. The basis for the request for conference shall be stated in
the request. The user or property owner shall provide an address for any return
notice. Said conference shall be scheduled within five days of the written
request and at a time convenient to the Treasurer or Treasurer’s designee. The
user or property owner shall be given at least 15 days’ notice sent to the
party requesting the conference. Notice shall be effective upon mailing to the
address of the original notice, or the address provided in the request for
conference. Any legal issue that might be brought before a court of law may be
raised in this conference. Fairness or equity shall not be at issue. This step
is not mandatory and either party may disregard the same. If the Treasurer
decides to refuse a conference request, the Treasurer shall do so by responding
in writing within five days of receipt of the request.
      (3)   The Treasurer shall provide a written statement of the outcome of
the conference within 72 hours of the conclusion of the conference and it shall
be mailed to the user or property owner at the address provided in the request
or the address of the notice, if unchanged. This shall not be considered a new
bill or invoice. This conference and the statement issued shall not toll or
recommence the running of the 90-day notice provision required in division (B)
(1) above.
      (4)   Within ten days of the original notice of lien set out in division
(B)(1) above, if the user or property owner wishes to forego the Treasurer’s
conference, or within ten days of the statement from the Treasurer, the debtor
or property owner may contest the user fee billing, by requesting a hearing
before the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court shall hold a de novo hearing on
all relevant legal issues raised by the debtor or property owner, within 15
days of receipt of said request. Fairness and equity shall not be at issue. A
decision upon all relevant issues shall be rendered within ten days of said
hearing.
      (5)   The parties may continue the aforementioned conference or hearing
from time to time as agreed by the parties. However, the lien may be filed
immediately upon the running of the 90-day notice provision, so long as the
outcome of the procedure has become final.
      (6)   Either party may file an appeal to the Circuit Court, within 30
days of the decision by the Municipal Court. The Circuit Court shall consider
the appeal under its general authority, including but not limited to W. Va.
Code § 51-2-2(f).
      (7)   Upon the running of the 90-day notice provision, and the exhausting
of the procedure through the Municipal Court, the Treasurer may file an
appropriate lien, regardless of any appeal to Circuit Court, unless a judicial
order is entered to the contrary.
      (8)   No user fee, collection costs, legal fees, interest, or related
costs shall be challenged greater than five years after the earlier of the date
of billing or the date of use.

combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her
discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity
theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red
flags to the Mayor or Treasurer. If, in his or her discretion, such employee

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

file for the consumer. See 16 C.F.R. § 641.1(b).
      TOWN. The Town of White Hall.
   (C)   Policy. In the event that the town receives a notice of address

to be appropriate by such employee:
      (1)   Compare the information in the consumer report with:

      (1)   In the event that the town reasonably confirms that an address
provided by a consumer to the town is accurate, the town is required to provide
such address to the consumer reporting agency from which the town received a
notice of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information
is required to be provided to the consumer reporting agency when:

report relates to the consumer about whom the town requested the report;
         (b)   The town establishes a continuing relation with the consumer;
and

the reporting period in which the town establishes a relationship with the
customer.

the right to remove a towing service from the rotation list of the County
Bureau of Emergency Services, Enhanced 911 Communications Center for reasons
including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Intoxication on the part of the driver of the tow truck;
      (2)   Inexcusable tardiness, or failure to make an appearance within a
reasonable time limit;
      (3)   Equipment deemed inappropriate or considered a safety hazard;
      (4)   Routinely failing to remove wreckage debris from a roadway or
refusing on any occasion to remove debris from the roadway when requested to do
so by a police officer or other emergency personnel; or
      (5)   Any other non-conforming action that would be deemed inappropriate
by the Chief of Police, including, but not limited to, any pertinent criminal
act or conviction of a towing service operator or an employee.
   (C)   The Police Department shall not be liable for any damages, or
injuries, that may occur as a result of the process of towing by said towing
services.

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or “stop” signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be

or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (D)   Red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.

or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.

signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the
provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made
at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made,
but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the
signal.

signs.

§ 72.022 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (G) below, whenever any person who has
not previously been convicted of any offense under this section or under any
statute of the United States or of any state or any other ordinance relating to
driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any other
drug does the following, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and
with the consent of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and,
notwithstanding any provisions of any code to the contrary, the accused shall
have an opportunity to participate in and successfully complete the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in W. Va. Code § 17C-5A-3a:
      (1)   Notifies the court within 30 days of his or her arrest of his or
her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under §
72.021(C) of this code.
   (B)   A defendant’s election to participate in a deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in W. Va. Code § 17C-5A-2.
   (C)   (1)   If the Town Attorney files a motion alleging that the defendant,
during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, has been
removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the Program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to division (D) below, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to division (C)(1)
above must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the Program.
   (D)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the Town Attorney, who shall, within 30 days after service, advise
the Judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such objections on
the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no objections filed
within the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss the charges
against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to the
dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in division (C)
above.
   (E)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this division (E) be convicted of a subsequent violation of this Traffic Code,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime, except as otherwise provided by law.
Except as otherwise provided by law regarding subsequent offenses, the effect
of the dismissal and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation
of law to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as
to whom a dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held
to be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement
by reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than
the inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as that term by law.
   (F)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (G)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of

commercial motor vehicle(s); or
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under any statute of the United States, of this state, or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug.
   (H)   Any person who has been subject to dismissal and discharge under this
section may apply to the County Circuit Court for an order of expungement
pursuant to and as provided by these provisions.
      (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to run
immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any person
under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to expunge
from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial, and
conviction, pursuant to this section, except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles. Provided, any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the Town Attorney objects to the expungement, the objections
shall be filed with the court within 30 days after service of a motion for
expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the defendant or
the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person, during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this division (H), has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Traffic Code to the contrary,
any person prosecuted for a violation of §
72.021(C) of this code whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be liable for any fine and court costs. Payment of such fine
and costs may be made a condition of deferral. The costs assessed pursuant to
this division (I), whether as a condition of deferral or not, shall be
distributed as other court costs in accordance with law.

adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold such vehicle,
including two separate means of applying the brakes, each of which means shall
be effective to apply the brakes to at least two wheels. If these two separate
means of applying the brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so
constructed that failure of any one part of the operating mechanism shall not
leave the motor vehicle without brakes on at least two wheels.
      (2)   Every motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, and moped, when operated upon
a street or highway, shall be equipped with at least one brake which may be
operated by hand or foot.
      (3)   Every trailer or semitrailer of a gross weight of 3,000 pounds or
more when operated upon a street or highway shall be equipped with brakes
adequate to control the movement of and to stop and to hold such vehicle and so
designed as to be applied by the driver of the towing motor vehicle from its
cab, and such brakes shall be so designed and connected that in case of an
accidental breakaway of the towed vehicle the brakes shall be automatically
applied.
      (4)   Every new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer hereinafter sold
in this state and operated upon the streets or highways shall be equipped with
service brakes upon all wheels, with the following exceptions:
         (a)   Trucks and truck-tractors having three or more axles need not
have brakes on the front wheels, except when such vehicles are equipped with at
least two steerable axles, the wheels of one such axle need not be equipped
with brakes; and

motorcycles, motor-driven cycles, and mopeds, shall be equipped with parking
brakes adequate to hold the vehicle on any grade on which it is operated, under
all conditions of loading on a surface free from snow, ice, or loose material.
The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the
foregoing requirements by the driver’s muscular effort or by spring action or
by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted by the service brakes or
other source of power provided that failure of the service brake actuation
system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes
from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking
brakes shall be so designed that when once applied they shall remain applied
with the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or
leakage of any kind.
         (b)   The same brake drums, brake shoes and lining assemblies, brake
shoe anchors, and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated
with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the
parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service
brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that a failure of
any one part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes.
      (7)   The brake shoes operating within or upon the drums on the vehicle
wheels of any motor vehicle may be used for both service and hand operation.

negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and it is not admissible in mitigation of
damages. Provided, the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an in
camera hearing to determine whether an injured party’s failure to wear a safety
belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.
      (2)   Upon a finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial by
special interrogatory to the jury, determine:
         (a)   That the injured party failed to wear a safety belt; and
         (b)   That the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a failure
to mitigate damages.
      (3)   The trier of fact may reduce the injured party’s recovery for
medical damages by an amount not to exceed 5% thereof. In the event the
plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of 5% of medical damages, the court shall
make the calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to
wear a safety belt may not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual
computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.

or her findings and the Town Administrator shall forward the same unto the
Council for disposition as hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   If Council shall receive a written report as set forth above,
Council shall make a preliminary determination whether the act set forth in the
written report constitutes a nuisance as defined in this chapter, and if
Council determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the acts
complained of in the written report, constitute a violation of this chapter,
Council shall set a time and place for a full hearing on the allegations
contained in the written report.
      (2)   Council shall cause a copy of the written report and notice of a
hearing for it to be served upon the owner, occupant, or person causing,

other means calculated to give notice of the hearing to the owner, occupant, or
person causing, permitting, or maintaining such nuisance.
      (3)   At such hearing, the Town Council, Chief of Police, or some other

hearing and present such evidence as that person deems appropriate with regard
to the matters set forth in the written report.
      (4)   After presentation of all matters before Council, Council shall
determine whether acts set forth in the written report constitute a nuisance
pursuant to this chapter. If Council so finds, Council shall further direct the
appropriate town officials to, among other things, void any licenses issued by
this town for the operation of any commercial establishment and/or direct the
Town Attorney to bring such action in the Circuit Court of the county, to
permanently enjoin the nuisance and/or to remediate the nuisance.

a public nuisance by the town shall be collected as a debt from the owner,
occupant, or person causing, jointly and severally, permitting, or maintaining

§ 93.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Outdoor advertising is a legitimate, commercial use of private
property adjacent to roads and highways;
   (B)   Outdoor advertising is an integral part of the business and marketing
function of an established segment of the national economy which serves to
promote and protect private investments in commerce and industry;

and devices in areas adjacent to roads and highways should be regulated in
order to protect the public investment in such roads and highways, to protect
private investments in property adjacent to said roads and highways, to promote
recreational value of public travel, to preserve natural beauty, and to promote
the reasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays, and
devices;
   (D)   Council further finds and declares that fiscal actualities reflect
that the people of the Town of White Hall would suffer economically if the town
failed to enact provisions to recover its costs of enforcing this chapter,
although it is the main intention of this chapter, among other things, to
provide a statutory basis for regulation of outdoor advertising consistent with
the public policy relating to areas adjacent to roads and highways, including
federal-aid interstate and primary highways as declared by the Congress of the
United States;
   (E)   This chapter, upon its legally effective date, will clarify,
supersede, or otherwise override Ordinance 07-004. Likewise, Ordinance 07-004,
upon its effective date, clarified, superseded Ordinance 04-001, Ordinance 03-
003, Special Ordinance 03-001, and the action passed by Council on August 12,
2003, and this chapter will continue in that effect;
   (F)   The Town of White Hall does not want to nor intends to prevent or
restrict purely noncommercial speech; and
   (G)   The Town of White Hall has and is exercising its authority to engage
in these regulations under the West Virginia Code, including, but not limited

§ 93.07 PERMITS REQUIRED FOR EACH SIGN AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   Except as in this chapter otherwise provided, no person shall
construct, erect, operate, use, maintain, or cause or permit to be constructed,
erected, operated, used, or maintained any advertising sign, display, or device
without first obtaining a permit for the advertising sign, display, or device
from the town and paying the annual fee for the advertising sign, display, or
device as provided in this section. Permits are required for all free-standing
permanent signage, billboard signs, (non-moving and moving-static) and
temporary mobile/trailer signs.
   (B)   A separate application for a permit shall be made for each separate
advertising sign, display, or device, on a form furnished by the town, which
application shall be signed by the applicant or its representative duly
authorized in writing to act for it, and shall describe and set forth the size,
shape, and the nature of the proposed advertising sign, display, or device, and
its actual or proposed location with sufficient accuracy to enable the Mayor to
locate and identify it. Each application for free-standing permanent signs and
permanent billboards will require a non-refundable $25 charge. Temporary mobile
signs will require a non-refundable $35 application fee.
   (C)   A non-refundable inspection fee of $75 shall be charged for each
proposed location.

   (F)   Each portion of an advertising sign upon which a display is posted or
exhibited shall constitute a separate advertising sign for purposes of this
section. If the permit is refused by the town, an order shall be made and
entered to that effect and a copy of such order shall be served on such
applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and one-half of the fee
shall be refunded to the applicant, accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions of law upon which the order was made and entered. Each application
shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant or its agent that the
owner or other person in control or in possession of the real property upon
which such advertising sign, display, or device is to be constructed, erected,
operated, used, or maintained, has consented thereto, including the
requirements of § 93.11 hereunder. Copies of any documents purporting to
provide said authority shall also be provided and attached to said application.
Application shall be made in like manner for a permit to operate, use, or
maintain any existing advertising sign, display, or device. Permits issued
hereunder shall expire on June 30 of each year, and shall not be prorated, and
may be renewed upon the payment of an annual fee. No application shall be
required for a renewal of a permit.
   (G)   If more than one side of an advertising sign is used for advertising,
a fee for each side shall be required. Advertising in the round shall be
treated as using three sides. Any previous existing "stacked" billboards shall
require a fee for each separate sign surface.
   (H)   Each sign, display, or device and its structure shall be well-
maintained, structurally sound, and generally safe at all times. The Mayor or
their designee shall inspect said sign, display, or device and its structure on
at least an annual basis. In the event that the licensee disagrees with the
Mayor's finding, and the Mayor or Town Council deems it necessary to solicit a
third-party opinion of a registered engineer or person similarly situated, who
shall be fully registered and licensed to operate within the Town of White Hall
and the State of West Virginia, to inspect said structures and provide an
opinion as to its structural soundness and general safety, the licensee shall
bear the burden of reimbursing the engineer or third-party for all costs and
fees. In the event that said structure is found to be structurally unsound or
unsafe, it shall be removed or repaired within 30 days, or immediately in the
circumstance that said structure is deemed to be an imminent hazard or danger.
   (I)   The town shall have authority, after 30 days' notice in writing to the
licensee, to the last address provided by the licensee, to make and enter an
order revoking any permit issued by it under this section in any case where it
shall appear that the application for the permit or any format, art, or wording
change contains knowingly false or misleading information or that the permittee
has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, unless such permittee
shall, before the expiration of said 30 days, correct such false or misleading
information and comply with the provisions of this chapter. Such order shall be
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which such order
was made and entered. If the constructions, erection, operation, use, or
maintenance of any advertising sign, display, or device for which a permit is
issued by the town and the permit fee has been paid as above provided, shall be
prevented by any zoning board, commission, or other public agency which also
has jurisdiction over the proposed advertising sign, display, or device, or its
site, the permit shall be revoked. All outdoor advertising signs, displays, or
devices shall be removed by the permittee within 30 days after the date of the
expiration or revocation of the permit for the same. Any permittee failing to
remove any such advertising sign, display, or device within said 30 days as
required herein shall be deemed to have violated this chapter and shall be
subject to remedies set out herein. Any decision by the Mayor or their designee
shall be subject to appeal to the Town Council.

permit was issued, within the guidelines of this chapter. The Mayor or their
designee shall review any display, device, or advertisement placed or replaced
upon the structure or sign for content, format, artwork, or wording compliance
with this chapter. The outdoor advertising licensee shall notify the Mayor or
their designee of any advertising replacement in writing contemporaneous with
the posting or displaying thereof. A change in the advertising content to an
advertisement on behalf of the licensee itself or to a blank-white surface
shall be exempt from review or notification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
sign, display, or device allowed under this chapter may contain, in lieu of any
other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct
attention to a business operated for profit or to a commodity or service for
sale, and that complies with all other requirements of this chapter. Said
messages shall be subject to review or approval by the Mayor, Town Council, or
any designee, only with regards to whether or not said information is lawful
noncommercial speech as aforementioned, and not otherwise. Said messages
include, but may not be limited to, "political speech." Any person adversely
affected by an order made and entered by the Mayor may process an appeal before
Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any decision of the Mayor or
their designee enforced by the Town Council is entitled to a judicial review
thereof. Such judicial review shall be in the Circuit Court of Marion County.

modified on appeal to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.

§ 11-12-3(a) and (b), shall also obtain a business registration certificate
from the Town of White Hall on or before the first day of July of each fiscal
year. The exemptions from registration or payment of registration tax set out
in W. Va. Code § 11-12-3(c) and (d), or those set out in division (B), set

fixed business location from which property or services are offered for sale or
lease to the public as a class, or to a limited pillion of the public, or at
which customer accounts may be opened, closed, or serviced, and said
certificate shall be prominently displayed at each location. A separate
business registration certificate is not required for each coin-operated
machine. A separate certificate is required for each location from which the
making of coin-operated machines available to the public is itself a business
activity.
      (2)   A business that sells or provides tangible personal property or
services from or out of one or more vehicles needs a separate business
registration certificate for each location in this state from or out of which
business is conducted. A legible and accurate, full-sized copy of its business
registration certificate shall be carried in each vehicle and publicly
displayed while business is conducted from or out of the vehicle.
   (B)   The business registration fee hereby levied as to all registrants
shall be $125 for all newly registered businesses in the town, after the
effective date of this section. Established businesses in the town will
increase to $125, effective January 1, 2022; provided, persons or entities
which qualify for exemption under § 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, the United States and its several agencies, the State of West
Virginia, and political subdivisions thereof: shall be exempt from payment of
the monetary certificate fee, notwithstanding that said persons or entities
must complete all other requirements of this section.
   (C)   (1)   Every person or entity required to obtain a business
registration certificate under the provisions of this section, that commences
business activities after the first day of any fiscal year, shall obtain such
business registration certificate before commencing activities in this
municipality. Said fee shall not be prorated.
      (2)   Nonprofit organizations will be exempt from remitting a business
registration fee but are still required to keep up-to-date records with the
town administration offices.
   (D)   Any business applying for a business registration certificate or doing
business in the Town of White Hall shall be and remain in compliance with all
federal, state, and local business, tax, licensing, labor or other laws
applicable to the operation of said business. Failure to be in compliance with
said laws shall be cause for refusal to issue and/or revocation of said
registration certification.
   (E)   Any business or property owner located in the Town of White Hall and
contracting for business with any person, business, or entity not presently
registered to do business in the Town of White Hall shall require, as a term of
said contract, that said person, business, or entity, or any of its sub-
contractors, shall legally register to do business in the Town of White Hall.
   (F)   All other legal remedies provided to the Town of White Hall for the
enforcement or punishment of violation of this section are reserved, and
nothing herein shall be construed as to preempt the general ordinances,
including, but not limited to, the Criminal Code of the Town of White Hall, the
State of West Virginia, and/or the United States of America. Specifically, the
crimes of false swearing, perjury, and fraud may still be prosecuted as
applicable to the requirements of this section.
   (G)   The Administrator shall have the lawful powers of this municipality,
delegated to it by the state code, to enforce all of the provisions of this
section. Any person or entity directly and adversely affected by refusal to
issue a registration certificate or to renew a certificate, or any action taken
under this section, may request a hearing before the Municipal Judge, provided
said request is made within 30 days from the date of written notice of the
refusal or action that resulted in such direct and adverse effect.
   (H)   All money collected from this business registration fee shall be
deposited into the general fund.

competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair,
or invalidate the remainder of this section, but shall be confined in its
operation to the provision therein directly involved in the controversy in
which such judgment shall have been rendered, and the applicability of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
   (C)   Fees. The fee for a special event vendor license will be $25 for up to
four events annually within the town limits. Additional events will be $10

property, or other consideration for or in exchange for the right to occupy a
hotel room as herein defined.
   CONSUMER. A person who pays the consideration for the use or occupancy of a
hotel room. The term CONSUMER does not mean the government of the United States

HOTEL does not mean a hospital, sanitarium, extended care facility, nursing
home, or university or college housing unit, or any facility providing fewer
than three rooms in private homes, not exceeding a total of ten days in a
calendar year, nor any tent, trailer, or camper campsites; provided, that where

general non-student public for a consideration, the term HOTEL does, if
otherwise applicable, apply to those accommodations for the purposes of this
tax.
   HOTEL OPERATOR. The person who is proprietor of a hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, trustee in
possession, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, executor, or in any other
capacity. Where the HOTEL OPERATOR performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent is a hotel operator for the purposes of this chapter and has the same
duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions
of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent is, however,
considered to be compliance by both.

   STATE PARK. Any state-owned facility which is part of this state’s park and
recreation system established pursuant to this code. For purposes of this
chapter, any recreational facility otherwise qualifying as a “hotel” and
situated within a state park is considered to be solely within the county in
which the building or buildings comprising the facility are physically
situated, notwithstanding the fact that the state park within which the
facility is located may lie within the jurisdiction of more than one county.
   TAX, TAXES, or THIS TAX. The hotel occupancy tax authorized by this chapter.
   TAXING AUTHORITY. A municipality or county levying or imposing the tax

the boundaries of the town. Effective July 1, 2005, the rate of such tax shall
be 6% of the consideration paid for such use and occupancy, provided that the
County Commission is not charging a similar tax which nullifies the authority
of the town to charge said tax pursuant to W. Va. Code, § 7-18-2. Such
consideration shall not include the amount of tax imposed on the transaction
under W. Va. Code, Chapter 11, Article 15, or charges for meals, valet service,
room service, telephone service, or other charges or consideration not paid for
use or occupancy of a hotel room. The tax shall be paid by the consumer or
occupant of the hotel room and shall be collected by the hotel operator as a
part of the consideration paid for the occupancy of the hotel room.

for, and remit to the town, all taxes paid by the consumer. The hotel operator
shall separately state the tax authorized by this chapter on all bills,
invoices, accounts, books of account, and records relating to consideration
paid for occupancy or use of a hotel room. All taxes collected pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the hotel
until the tax shall have been remitted to the town as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   A hotel or hotel operator shall not represent to the public, in any
manner, directly or indirectly, that it will absorb all or any part of the tax
or that the tax is not to be considered an element in the price to be collected
from the consumer.
   (C)   A hotel operator doing business wholly or partly on a credit basis
shall require the consumer to pay the full amount of tax due upon the credit
sale at the time such sale is made or within 30 days thereafter.
   (D)   Notwithstanding that the total amount of such taxes collected by a
hotel operator may be in excess of the amount for which a consumer would be
liable by application of the levy of 6% for the occupancy of a hotel room or
rooms, the total amount of all taxes collected by any hotel operator shall be
remitted to the town. No profit shall accrue to any person as a result of the
collection of the tax authorized under this chapter.

together with all invoices and other pertinent documents. Such records and
documents shall be kept and maintained for a period or three years unless the
hotel operator is notified by the town that they be kept for a longer period.
   (B)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in monthly
installments on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month next
succeeding that month in which the tax accrued; provided, that for credit sales
in which the tax authorized by this chapter is not collected by the hotel
operator at the time of such sales, such tax shall not, for the purposes of
this chapter, be regarded as having accrued until the date on which it is
either received by the hotel operator or upon the expiration of the 30-day
payment period set forth in §
113.03(C) of this chapter, whichever shall first occur. The hotel operator
shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, prepare and deliver to the
town a return for the preceding month, in a form containing such information as
required by the Town Treasurer. Such form shall include all information
necessary for the computation, collection, and subsequent distribution of the
tax as the town may require. A remittance for the amount of the tax due shall
accompany each return. The hotel operator or his or her duly authorized agent
shall sign each return, and verification of said signature shall be required
upon request by the town.
(Ord. 05-003, passed 6-27-2005)
§ 113.05 LIABILITY.
   (A)   If any hotel operator or taxpayer fails to collect the tax imposed by
this chapter, or fails to properly remit such tax to the town, he or she shall
be personally liable for such amount as he or she failed to collect or remit,
in addition to all penalties.
   (B)   If the hotel operator or taxpayer is an association or corporation,
the officers thereof actually participating in the management or operation of
the association or corporation shall be personally liable, jointly and
severally, for any default on the part of the association or corporation to
collect or remit the tax as herein required. Further, said officers shall be

§ 114.01 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996, being Pub. Law 104-104, Sec. 1(a), 110
Stat. 56, affirmed the town’s authority concerning the placement, construction,
and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The town also has
authority pursuant to W. Va. Code §§ 8-12-5 and 8-12-13 through 8-12-15, and
other sections therein, to regulate the erection and maintenance of any
structure within the municipality, or affecting the municipality, and to
otherwise regulate utilities generally therein. The town finds that wireless
telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health,
safety, public welfare, character, and environment of the town and its
inhabitants. The town also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the town
and of significant benefit to the town and its residents. In order to ensure
that the placement, construction, maintenance, or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities is consistent with the town’s policies, the town
is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this chapter is to minimize the
negative impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities,
and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the town.
