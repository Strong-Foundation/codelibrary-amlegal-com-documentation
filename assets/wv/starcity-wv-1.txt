EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the City Code into component codes,
chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the City Code.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the City Code. It indicates whether a given ordinance was
consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections.
Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
311.05 OPERATION AND USE OF LEGAL SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES.
   (a)    Definition. For the purpose of this section the term legal special
purpose vehicle shall include but not be limited to the following: all terrain
vehicle (ATV) as defined by West Virginia Code 17A-1-1(ii), go-cart; golf cart;
unregistered off road motorized dirt bike, whether two or three wheeled;
snowmobile as defined by West Virginia Code 17A-1-1; or, given the Town's
terrain and climate, any other such motorized vehicle which would appear to be
used for the principle purpose of recreation and not for the general
transportation of persons or goods.
   (b)   Allowances and Requirements. It is permissible for an individual
licensed to operate a motor vehicle to use any legal special purpose vehicle
for transportation or recreational purposes, within or upon the public streets,
roads, alleys, ways, sidewalks and crosswalks or upon any other real property,
which is publicly owned, leased or controlled, within the corporate limits of
the Town of Star City.
   (c)    The owner of the legal special purpose vehicle being operated as
authorized above shall ensure the vehicle is equipped with:
      (1)   One or more headlamps;
      (2)   One or more tail lamps;
      (3)   One or more brake lamps;
      (4)   A braking system, other than a parking brake;
      (5)   A horn or other warning device;
      (6)   A muffler and, if required by an applicable federal statute or
rule, an emission control system;
      (7)   Rearview mirrors;
      (8)   A windshield, unless the operator wears eye protection while
operating the vehicle;
      (9)   A speedometer, if equipped, illuminated for nighttime operation;
      (10)   For vehicles designed by the manufacturer for carrying one or more
passengers, a seat designed for passengers;
      (11)   Tires that have at least 2/32 inches or greater tire tread; and
      (12)   Liability insurance at limits deemed reasonable given the nature
and use of the legal special purpose vehicle.
   (d)   Prohibition of Minors to Operate Special Use Vehicles. A parent,
custodian or guardian of a minor commits an offense hereunder if said parent,
custodian or guardian knowingly permits or by insufficient control allows said
minor to operate, ride upon or use any legal special purpose vehicle for
transportation or recreational purposes, within or upon the public streets,
roads, alleys, ways, sidewalks and crosswalks or upon any other real property
which is publicly owned, leased or controlled, within the corporate limits of
the Town of Star City. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that the parent,
custodian or guardian should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of said minor in his or her custody. This requirement is intended
to hold a neglectful or careless parent, custodian or guardian up to a
reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective
test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that the parent or guardian was
completely indifferent to the activities or conduct of such minor.
   (e)   Penalty.
      (1)   Any violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute
the commission of a misdemeanor offense, and the Police Department for the Town
of Star City, or any other law enforcement officer of any other policing agency
exercising proper jurisdiction within the corporate limits of the Town of Star
City, is hereby authorized and empowered to issue a citation and to charge any
person who fails to abide by the requirements contained in this section,
jurisdiction thereof being in the Municipal Court for the Town of Star City.
      (2)   A person convicted of failure to abide by the requirements of this
section shall be punished as follows:
         A.   First offense conviction: Any person convicted of a first offense
shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) together with applicable court costs;
         B.   Second offense conviction: Any person convicted of a second
offense shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) together with applicable court costs;
         C.   Third offense conviction: Any person convicted of a third offense
shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) together with applicable court costs.
   (f)   Additional Provisions. It shall not be an offense for any person to
use, ride or operate a motorized recreational apparatus within the corporate
limits of the Town of Star City as follows:
      (1)   Upon a designated parade route, when such person or persons is a
duly registered and recognized participant in a parade which has been duly
permitted by the Town of Star City in accordance with the provisions of Section
311.04;
      (2)   Upon private property;
      (3)   Upon property otherwise restricted as to such use, when such person

311.04;

or persons are performing snow removal services; or
      (6)   As permitted by Article
355 of this Code.
   (g)   Disclaimer. Nothing contained herein is intended to nor shall it be
construed so as to create or form the basis for any civil or administrative
liability whatsoever on the part of the Town of Star City, or any of its
officers, agents, insurers, for any injury or damage sustained by any person
whomsoever as a consequence of any action or inaction on the part of the Town
of Star City as related in any manner to the enforcement or non-enforcement of
the provisions of this section.
   (h)   Severability. In any portion of this section, or its application to
any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional or invalid, such
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not effect the remaining portions of
this section. Town Council hereby declares that it would have enacted the
remaining portions regardless of whether any part of this ordinance is declared
unconstitutional or invalid. (Passed 8-20-24.)

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

street or highway construction maintenance work, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,

other part thereof. (WVaC 17C-3-9)

   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:

(j) or under a prior enactment of that subsection, for an offense which

the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant, indictment, or information for a
second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.

(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

333.011 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle upon the public streets or
highways of this Town shall be deemed to have given his consent by the
operation thereof, subject to the provisions of West Virginia Code Article 17C-
5, et seq., to a preliminary breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of
either his blood, breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic
content of his blood. A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in
accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17-C-5-5 whenever a police
officer has reasonable cause to believe a person to have been driving a motor
vehicle upon the public streets and highways while under the influence of
alcohol, controlled substance or drugs as prohibited by Section
333.01. A secondary test of blood, breath or urine shall be incidental to a
lawful arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have
been driving a motor vehicle upon the public streets or highways while under
the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs as prohibited by
Section
333.01. The Police Chief shall designate which one of the aforesaid secondary
tests shall be administered, provided, that if the test so designated is a
blood test, and the person so arrested refuses to submit to such blood test,
then the law enforcement office making such arrest shall designate in lieu
thereof, either a breath or urine test be administered, and notwithstanding the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-7 such refusal to submit to a blood test
only shall not result in the suspension of the arrested person's license to
operate a motor vehicle in this State. Any person to whom a preliminary breath
test is administered who is then arrested shall be told that his refusal to
submit to the secondary test finally designated as provided in this section,
will result in the suspension of his license to operate a motor vehicle in this
State for a period of one year.
   (b)   For the purpose of this article, the term "law enforcement officer"
means and is limited to any member of the Police Department of this Town. Only
the person actually administering such test shall be competent to testify as to
the results and veracity of such tests.

333.012 INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this Town while
under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon the
trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol in
the person's blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as shown
by a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine, is admissible, if the
sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after the time of arrest
or of the acts alleged, and shall give rise to the following presumptions or
have the following effect:
   (a)   Evidence that there was at the time five hundredths of one percent
(.05%) or less, by weight, of alcohol in his blood, shall be prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
   (b)   Evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of
one percent (.05%) and less than ten hundredths of one percent (.10%) by weight
of alcohol in his blood, shall be relevant evidence, but it is not to be given
prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under the influence of
alcohol;
   (c)   Evidence that there was, at that time, ten hundredths of one percent
(.10%) or more, by weight of alcohol in his blood, shall be admitted as prima
facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol. Percent by
weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon milligrams of alcohol per
one hundred cubic centimeters of blood.
   A chemical analysis of a person's blood, breath or urine, in order to give
rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in subsections (a),
(b) and (c) hereof shall be performed in accordance with methods and standards
approved by the State Department of Health. A chemical analysis of blood or
urine to determine the alcoholic content of blood shall be conducted by a
qualified laboratory or by the State Police Scientific Laboratory of the
Criminal Identification Bureau of the Department of Public Safety.
   The provisions of this section shall not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.

333.013 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state

which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle or other conveyance on or
entering the streets and highways in compliance with legal requirements and the
duty of all persons to use due care.
   (b)   Where no special hazard exists that requires lower speed for
compliance with subsection (a) of this section, the speed of any vehicle not in
excess of the limits specified in this section or established as hereinafter

parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.

misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.

designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

   (a)   The operator of an electric bicycle has all of the rights and

   (c)   A person may not tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to
change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-
assist and throttle-assist types of engagement. If a motor on an electric

that vehicle is no longer an electric bicycle. The provisions of this
subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle operated solely
and exclusively on a person’s own property.

requirements for bicycles adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety

trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given
the same rights and privileges of a traditional, non-electric bicycle and will

rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related
limitations.
      (2)   A Class 3 electric bicycle may not be operated on a bicycle path,
multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:
provided, that the provisions of this subdivision are not applicable to a
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail if the municipality, local

bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail expressly permits that
operation.

no court costs may be assessed to any person violating the requirements of
Section
373.09(b).

the animal.
      (2)   If a dog is tied or confined unattended outdoors under weather
conditions that adversely affect the health of the dog, a shelter must be
provided to accommodate the dog and protect it from the weather and, in

   (e)   Impoundment. In addition to the other provisions of this article, the
Town may establish a dog pound and keep therein dogs seized under any of the
provisions of this article. In such pound the dogs shall be segregated as to
sexes. Any dog for which the head tax is delinquent, or any dog found running
at large in the Town, may be seized and impounded for a period of fifteen days,
for which a fee of two dollars ($2.00) for seizing and impounding such dog and
an additional fee of fifty cents ($.50) for each day, or any part thereof, for
which a dog is kept impounded shall be charged against the owner of such dog.
The owner or keeper of any impounded dog may have such dog upon paying the
delinquent tax, if any, thereon and the impounding fees. If such tax and/or
fees are not paid within fifteen days from the date of impounding, such dog may
be sold, and there shall be deducted from the proceeds of such sale the

attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and

assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

imposed by the Morgantown Area Youth Services Project. Should the accused fail
to complete the requirements as imposed by the Morgantown Area Youth Services
Project, the accused waives the appropriate statute of limitations and the
accused’s right to a speedy trial under any applicable federal or state
constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of Court during the period of
enrollment in the program through the Morgantown Area Youth Services Project
and the Court may order that the deferral be terminated and thereupon proceed
as if the deferral had not been permitted. When the accused shall have
completed satisfactorily all of the terms and conditions imposed by the
Morgantown Area Youth Services Project, the accused may move the Court for an
Order dismissing the charges and the Court shall dismiss the charges.

knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

or in part, or if the Business Office has reasonable grounds to believe that
any return made is incorrect or is so deficient as not to form the basis of a
satisfactory assessment of the tax, he may proceed as he deems best to obtain
information on which to base the assessment of the tax. The Business Office
may, by its duly appointed agent, make examination of the books, records and
papers and audit the accounts of any such person, including bank accounts, and
may take the evidence, on oath, of any person whom he may believe shall be in
possession of any relevant information. As soon as possible after procuring
such information as he may be able to obtain as to any person making an
incomplete or incorrected return or failing or refusing to make a return, the
Business Office shall proceed to assess the tax and shall notify the person
assessed of the amount of tax. The assessment of the tax by the Business Office
shall be final as to any person who refuses to make a return.

with interest, in any proper action or suit against the Town. It shall not be
necessary for the taxpayer to protest against the payment of the tax or to make
any demand to have the same refunded to maintain such suit.

power to examine or cause to be examined, by any agent or representative
designated by the Business Office, any books, papers, records, memoranda or
other documents bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return
and may require the attendance of the person rendering the return or the
attendance of any other person having knowledge of the matters contained
therein. In connection therewith, the Business Office may take testimony and

tecum to compel the attendance of witnesses and production of documents for the

In the case of a Class A retail dealer, the license fee shall be one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each place of business within the Town; the license fee
for social, fraternal or private clubs not operating for profit, and having
been in continuous operation for two years or more immediately preceding the
date of application, shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any such club, to
be eligible for such license, shall be a bona fide club, with limited
membership, operated for the benefit of all the
      members thereof, and not operated for the profit of any one or more
individuals, even though members of such club, and shall be a club in which the
property and assets are actually owned in common by the members thereof, and
shall be a club for which bona fide qualifications for membership are required
and in which temporary memberships are not sold for a fee. All the books of
accounts and records of any such club shall be open to examination and
inspection by any duly authorized officer or representative of the Town, and
upon the consideration of an application for such club license or upon a
hearing for the revocation of any such club license, all books of account and
records of such club shall be produced before Council, if so requested.
      (1)   Class A licenses issued for social, fraternal or private clubs
shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at retail for
consumption only on the licensed premises where sold. All other Class A
licenses shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at retail
for consumption on or off the licensed premises.
      (2)   In the case of a Class B retailer, there shall be two types of a
Class B license, each type to be colored differently so as to be easily
distinguished. The fee for a Class B license authorizing the sale of unchilled
beer only shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00). The fee for a Class B license
authorizing the sale of both chilled and unchilled beer shall be one hundred
dollars ($100.00). A Class B license shall authorize the licensee to sell
nonintoxicating beer at retail in bottles, cans or other sealed containers
only, and only for consumption off the licensed premises. Sales under this
license to any person at any one time must be in less quantities than five
gallons. Such license may be issued only to the proprietor or owner of a
grocery store. For the purposes of this article, the term "grocery store" means
and includes any retail establishment commonly known as a grocery store or
delicatessen, where food or food products are sold for consumption off the
premises.
   (b)   In the case of a distributor, the license fee shall be two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) for each place of business within the Town.
   (c)   To be eligible for a Town license under this article, the applicant
must have applied for and received a corresponding license from the State, and
the revocation of any such State license by the State shall have the effect of
revoking the corresponding Town license, and such Town license shall thereupon
be null and void and not operated or transferable.
(Passed 3-5-62)

premises shall possess all the qualifications required of an individual
applicant for a retailer's license, including the requirements as to residence.
   (c)   The particular place for which the license is desired and a detailed

with the standards now or hereafter set up by the State Department of Health
and shall maintain the same in a sanitary condition. Separate toilets for each
sex, properly labelled, shall be conveniently provided; provided, that Council
shall have the discretion to waive this provision as to toilets in cases where,
in the opinion of Council, the sale of beer is only incidental to the
applicant, such as grocery stores, confectionaries, restaurants, etc.
   The foregoing provisions and requirements are mandatory prerequisites for
the issuance of a license, and in the event any applicant fails to qualify
under the same, the license shall be refused. In addition to the information
furnished in any application, Council may make or cause to be made such
additional and independent investigation of each applicant, and of the place to
be occupied, as deemed necessary or advisable; and the issuance of a license
may be withheld for such reasonable time as necessary for such investigation.
Council may refuse a license to any applicant under the provisions of this
article if it shall be of the opinion that the applicant is not a suitable
person to be licensed, or that the place to be occupied by the applicant is not
a suitable place, or that the license should not be issued for reason of
conduct declared to be unlawful by the provisions of this article.

held, after ten days' notice to the licensee of the time and place of such
hearing, which notice shall contain a statement or specification of the

   There is hereby imposed and levied upon each and every purchaser of a public
utility service an excise tax upon the privilege of purchasing, using or
consuming, within the corporate limits of this Municipality, such public
utility service. Such tax shall be in the amount of two percent (2%) of the
charge, exclusive of any federal or state tax thereon imposed upon the
purchaser, made by the seller against the purchaser with respect to each public
utility service, which tax in every case shall be collected by the seller and
paid by the purchaser upon the amount of each periodic statement rendered such
purchaser by the seller, and shall be paid by the purchaser to the seller at
the time the purchase price or such charge shall become due and payable under
the agreement between the purchaser and seller. The tax imposed and levied by
this article is in addition to all other taxes imposed and levied by this
Municipality. In the event the amount of the charge for any single public
utility service exceeds the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in any
given calendar month, to any single purchaser, no tax shall be imposed for such
additional purchase, use or consumption in excess of such amount of twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000). In the event more than one public utility shall

the Municipality the tax hereby imposed and levied at the time of collecting
the purchase price charged for its public utility service, and the amount of
tax actually collected, either by the month or by the quarter of each fiscal
year on any part thereof, shall be reported and remitted to the Municipality by

by the seller as being the most convenient in view of its bookkeeping or
accounting procedure. The seller shall also furnish to the Municipality with

purchaser who has failed or refuses to pay the tax so imposed or levied. The
tax imposed and levied by this article shall apply to periodic statements
rendered after August 1, 1971, for public utility service rendered subsequent
to August 1, 1971, and when any such periodic statement covers public utility
service rendered both before and after such date, only that portion of the
charge for public utility service rendered after such date shall be subject to
such tax, and the portion subject to such tax shall be such portion covered by
such periodic statement, as bears to the total number of days covered by such
periodic statement. The required reports shall be in the form prescribed by the

public utility service. (Passed 7-11-00.)
769.06 NONLIABILITY OF SELLER; REFUNDS; RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Any amount of tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt
due this Municipality. It shall be a personal obligation of the purchaser which
shall be enforceable as provided in West Virginia Code 8-13-15, or in any other
manner now or hereafter provided by law for compelling the payment of taxes due
municipalities.
   (b)   Any purchaser failing or refusing to pay the tax hereby imposed and
levied and any seller or purchaser violating any of the provisions hereof or
any lawful rule and regulation promulgated hereunder shall be subject to the
penalty provided in Section
705.99(b). The failure or refusal to pay the tax for public utility service

925.12  LEAK ADJUSTMENT.
   Customer sewer bills based upon metered water consumption may be adjusted in
accordance with this section when the bill for sewer service reflects unusual
usage which can be attributed to a qualified water leak on the Customer's side
of the point of water service.
   (a)   Sewer customers are eligible for only one (1) leak adjustment in a
twelve (12) consecutive month period. Each new leak adjustment period shall
begin on the first meter reading date following the period upon which the most
recent leak adjustment was based.
   (b)   For a customer to qualify for a sewer leak adjustment, the leak must
occur on the water service line running from the water meter to the served
structure or on internal, concealed structural plumbing, and that the lost
water did not enter the sanitary sewer collection system. Leaking commodes,
dripping faucets, malfunctioning appliances, leaking garden hoses and similar
situations of readily identifiable water leaks will not constitute leaks which
entitle the Customer to a leak adjustment recalculated bill.
   (c)   The Utility must be notified by the Customer as soon as possible that
the leak has occurred and that an adjustment is desired. A written request for
adjustment including documentation (described below), must be received by the
Utility within thirty (30) calendar days following discovery and correction of
the leak. Failure to do so will forfeit the Customer's right to a leak
adjustment.
   (d)   The burden of proof that the leak occurred and is eligible for
adjustment rests solely with the Customer. The Utility is under no obligation
to verify leak adjustment requests. The types of leak documentation which will
be accepted include detailed photographs of the leak, copies of plumber's
invoice for repairing the leak, etc. All such documentation shall remain the
property of the Utility.
   (e)   Should a leak be deemed by the Utility to be eligible for adjustment,
the Customer's bill will be adjusted as follows:
      (1)   The Customer will be charged the current tariff rate for the amount
of average historical usage of the preceding twelve (12) months, or the average
usage of the actual period of service if less than twelve (12) months. If the
leak occurs in the first month of service for the Customer, the Utility may use
the average historical usage of the same total customer class of service on the
utility; and,
      (2)   The Customer will be charged for usage in excess of the average
historical usage at the incremental leak adjustment rate authorized by the
Utility tariff in effect at the time of the leak. If there is no incremental
leak adjustment rate defined in the tariff, the Utility shall charge the
Commission's current estimate of "typical incremental" cost per thousand
gallons of water for excess usage above the historic usage.
         A.   Effective July 1, 2022. Five dollars and eighty-two cents ($5.82)
per thousand gallons (or portion thereof.)
         B.   Effective July 1, 2023.   Five dollars and ninety-nine cents
($5.99) per thousand gallons (or portion thereof.)
         C.   Effective July 1, 2024.   Six dollars and seventeen cents ($6.17)
per thousand gallons (or portion thereof.)
         D.   Effective July 1, 2025. Six dollars and thirty-six cents ($6.36)
per thousand gallons (or portion thereof.)
   (f)   The Utility shall advise a Customer requesting a sewer leak adjustment
under this section that a dispute regarding leak adjustments may be taken to
the Public Service Commission of West Virginia in the form of an informal or
formal complaint. (Passed 5-16-23)

929.04 LEAK ADJUSTMENT.
   Customer water bills based upon metered water consumption may be adjusted in
accordance with this section when the bill for water service reflects unusual
usage which can be attributed to a qualified water leak on the Customer's side
of the point of water service.
   (a)   Water customers are eligible for only one (1) leak adjustment in a
twelve (12) consecutive month period. Each new leak adjustment period shall
begin on the first meter reading date following the period upon which the most
recent leak adjustment was based.
   (b)   For a customer to qualify for a leak adjustment, the leak must occur
on the water service line running from the water meter to the served structure
or on internal, concealed structural plumbing. Leaking commodes, dripping
faucets, malfunctioning appliances, leaking garden hoses and similar situations
of readily identifiable water leaks will not constitute leaks which entitle the
Customer to a leak adjustment recalculated bill.
   (c)   The Utility must be notified by the Customer as soon as possible that
the leak has occurred and that an adjustment is desired. A written request for
adjustment including documentation (described below), must be received by the
Utility within thirty (30) calendar days following discovery and correction of
the leak. Failure to do so will forfeit the Customer's right to a leak
adjustment.
   (d)   The burden of proof that the leak occurred and is eligible for
adjustment rests solely with the Customer. The Utility is under no obligation
to verify leak adjustment requests. The types of leak documentation which will
be accepted include detailed photographs of the leak, copies of plumber's
invoice for repairing the leak, etc. All such documentation shall remain the
property of the Utility.
   (e)   Should a leak be deemed by the Utility to be eligible for adjustment,
the Customer's bill will be adjusted as follows:
      (1)   The Customer will be charged the current tariff rate for the amount
of average historical usage of the preceding twelve (12) months, or the average
usage of the actual period of service if less than twelve (12) months. If the
leak occurs in the first month of service for the Customer, the Utility may use
the average historical usage of the same total customer class of service on the
utility; and,
      (2)   The Customer will be charged for usage in excess of the average
historical usage at the incremental leak adjustment rate authorized by the
Utility tariff in effect at the time of the leak. If there is no incremental
leak adjustment rate defined in the tariff, the Utility shall charge the

930.07 DEGREES OF HAZARD.
   The Star City Public Water System recognizes the threat to the public water
system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree
of hazard and will require the installation of approved backflow prevention
devices, in a manner and within a time period appropriate for said degree of
hazard. (Passed 3-11-08.)
930.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow prevention device shall be allowed to continue in
service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness
of the present backflow prevention device, or otherwise results in an
unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has
increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow prevention device must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced pressure
principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow device is
present. (Passed 3-11-08.)
930.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.

be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, the repaired device will
be retested at owner’s expense to insure correct operation. High hazard
situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow
prevention device fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty days after the test date
will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or
a replacement device. Parallel installations of two devices is an effective
means of the owner ensuring the uninterrupted water service during the testing
or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such
continuity.
   (d)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a) hereof, in cases where there is a history of test
failure and the Star City Public Water System finds that the degree of hazard
involved warrants additional testing. The cost of any additional test(s) will
be borne by the owner.
(Passed 3-11-08.)

933.01 FINDINGS.
   The Common Council of the Town of Star City, West Virginia makes the
following findings:
   (a)   The professional engineering and financing analysis (Stormwater
Management Action Plan) submitted to the Town properly assesses and defines the
stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding
opportunities of the Town.
   (b)   Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding
opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing
analysis, it is appropriate to provide for an election to increase the levy
rates for the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use,
and enhancement of stormwater systems in Star City in concert with other water
resource management programs.
   (c)   Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the
corporate limits of Star City. While specific service and facility demands may
differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management
service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate
limits of Star City is consistent with the present and future needs of the
community.
   (d)   The stormwater needs, in the Town of Star City, include but are not
limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of
stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both
service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents
of Star City in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering
and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from
provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending
on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location,
demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk
exposure.
   (e)   The Town of Star City presently owns and operates stormwater
management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years.
The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by
the Town, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of
the Town to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance
stormwater systems and facilities in Star City in concert with the management
of other water resources in the Town. In order to do so, the Town must have
adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and
capital investment needs.
   (f)   The Common Council finds, concludes and determines that the imposition
of an additional levy provides the most practical and appropriate means of
properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Star City.
      (Passed 3-30-04.)
933.02 FUNDING.
   (a)   The Common Council shall, at the earliest possible date, submit to the
voters of the Town of Star City, the question of an additional levy. Upon
approval by at least sixty percent (60%) of said voters, there shall be imposed
an additional levy for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Council, prior to
the expiration of the term of aforementioned levy, may re-submit to the voters
the questions of continuing said levy. The rate of said levy(s) per $100.00 of
valuation, if approved, shall not exceed 6.25¢ for Class I property; 12.5¢ for
Class II property; and 25¢ for Class IV property.
   (b)   The Town Treasurer shall establish a stormwater fund in the Town
budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all
funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of stormwater
management, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and
licenses as may be established by the Common Council. Any revenues and receipts
of the stormwater program shall be placed in the Stormwater Fund and all
expenses shall be paid from the Stormwater Fund, except that other revenues,
receipts, and resources not accounted for in said Fund may be applied to
stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate
by the Common Council, upon recommendation of the Treasurer.
   (c)   The Common Council hereby transfers to the Public Works Department,
operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and
facilities owned and heretofore operated by the Town and other related assets,
including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located,
easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.
(Passed 3-30-04.)
933.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Beneficiaries of the Stormwater Management Program. Beneficiaries of
the stormwater management program shall include all persons, properties, and
entities served by and/or benefiting from the Town’s acquisition, management,
maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management
systems and facilities and regulations of public and private stormwater
systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties,
and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the
stormwater management program.
   (b)   Hydrologic Response. The hydrologic response of a property is the
manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is
conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not
limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic,
vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture
conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property.
   (c)   Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent
or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural
conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not
limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking
lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other
fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the
natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
   (d)   Stormwater Management System. Stormwater management systems address
the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality
(pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks,
lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and
funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in
the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface
water drainage.
   (e)   Undeveloped Land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has
been modified to such minimal degree as to have hydrologic response comparable
to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped
land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or
structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration
of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner
materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an
unaltered natural state.
(Passed 3-30-04.)
933.04 SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TOWN DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
   (a)   The Town drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks,
branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales,
storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other
structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the Town of
Star City which control and/or convey stormwater through which the Town
intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties.
The Town owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and
improvements to those segments of this system which (1) are located within
public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; (2) are subject to easements,
rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions
for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems
and facilities; or (3) are located on public lands to which the Town has
adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and
facilities. Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities
which are located on private property or public property not owned by the Town
of Star City and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems
and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems
and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property
owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of
the State of West Virginia and the United States of America.
   (b)   It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety
and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create
any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified
property within or without the boundaries of the Town of Star City. The Town of
Star City expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and
defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the Town, its
officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of
duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent
any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the Town as
a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the
Town, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of
the Town or under Federal or State law, the issuance of such permit, plan
approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express
or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action
based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the
imposition of money damages against the Town, its officers, employees or
agents.
(Passed 3-30-04.)
933.05 REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-SITE STORMWATER SYSTEMS; ENFORCEMENT METHODS AND
INSPECTIONS.
   All property owners and developers of developed real property within the
Town of Star City shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site
stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge
stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all Town of Star City development
regulations and the laws of the State of West Virginia and the United States of
America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be
subject to an abatement action filed by the Town in the Municipal Court. In the
event a public nuisance is found by the Court to exist, which the owner fails
to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Court, the Town
may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to
be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the
same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of
such action, the Town shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after
judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the City Tax Lien Book of the Clerk of
the County Commission of Monongalia County, West Virginia. The Town shall have
the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated
officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by
entities other than the Town, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to
inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order
to assure compliance.
(Passed 3-30-04.)

   (h)    Starting July 2015 For any new development or redevelopment
disturbing an area of an acre or greater a Stormwater Management and
Comprehensive Drainage Plan must be developed that will keep and manage on site
the first one inch of rainfall from a 24- hour storm preceded by 48 hours of no
measureable precipitation. Runoff volume reduction can be achieved by canopy
interception, soil amendments, evaporation, rainfall harvesting, engineered
infiltration, extended filtration and/or evapotranspiration and any combination
of the aforementioned practices. This first one inch of rainfall must be 100%
managed with no discharge to surface waters, except when the permitee chooses
to implement the conditions in paragraph 4 below. This can be achieved through
on site utilization of practices to include dry swales, bio-retention, rain
tanks and cisterns, soil amendments, roof top disconnections, permeable
pavement, porous concrete, permeable pavers, reforestation, grass channels,
green roofs and other practices that alone or combined will capture the first
one inch of rainfall runoff volume. Extended filtration practices that are
designed to capture and retain up to one inch of rainfall may discharge volume
in excess of the first inch through an under drain system. An Underground
Injection Control permit may be required when certain conditions are met.
      (1)    The following additional water quality requirements, as
applicable:
         a)    A project that is a potential hot spot with reasonable potential
for pollutant loading(s) must provide must provide water quality treatment for
associated pollutants before infiltration. (such as petroleum hydrocarbons at a
vehicles fueling station)
         b)    A project that is a potential hot spot with reasonable potential
for pollutant loading(s) that cannot implement adequate preventative or water
quality treatment measures to ensure compliance to ensure compliance with
groundwater and/or surface water quality standards, must properly convey
stormwater to a NPDES-permitted waste water treatment facility or via a
licensed waste hauler to a permitted treatment and disposal facility.
      (2)    Incentive Standards; A reduction of 0.2 inches from the one inch
runoff reduction standard may be applied to any of the following types of

         d)    Vertical Density, (floor to area ratio (FAR) of 2 or>18 units
per acre)
         e)    Mixed Use and Transit Oriented Development (within 1/2 mile of
transit)
(NOTE: For projects that cannot meet the runoff reduction requirement of the
0.4" after incentives have been applied, two alternatives are available: Off
site mitigation or payment in lieu will be applied at a 1:2 ratio for that
portion .)

   (i)    All development and/or redevelopment projects shall minimize the
impact to the water environment by applying structural and/or non-structural
management practices selected to address site-specific conditions. The minimum
requirement for runoff water quality treatment shall be a reduction of 80% of
the average post-development total suspended solids and a reduction of 40% of
the average post-development phosphorus load.
   (j)   No construction shall be performed in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of construction or in other areas,
regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions, increased
runoff, diminishing channel or floodplain storage capacity, harm to aquatic
life or any other manifestation of negative impact.
   (k)    New construction or reconstruction shall be permitted only after
temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control management practices have
been placed and are operational to the satisfaction of the Director. The
Director may halt construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement
actions consistent with this section upon a finding of inadequate erosion and

   (m)    The owner of a completed new development and/or redevelopment
construction shall submit to the Director within thirty (30) ninety (90) days
of substantial project completion an "as- built" plan of the stormwater
management facilities located upon the property/site.
   (n)    Waivers for Providing Stormwater Management.
      (1)    Unless waived by the Director, every applicant shall provide for
stormwater management as required by this section. Request for waiver must be
submitted in a form prescribed by the Director.
      (2)    The Director may not waive the minimum requirements for stormwater
management of water quality protection.
      (3)    Any requirements beyond those described in Section
934.20(i) may be waived by the Director, if the Director finds that meeting the
minimum on-site stormwater management requirements is not feasible due to the
unique natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. A determination
that requirements of this regulation cannot be met on site may not be based on
the difficulty or cost of implementing measures, but must include multiple
criteria that would rule out an adequate combination of the practices set forth
to meet these regulations. In instances where alternatives to complete on site
management of the first inch of rainfall are chosen, technical justification as
to the infeasibility of on site management must be documented. To be eligible
for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Director that the waiver will not result in any of the following impacts to
downstream waterways:
         (A)    Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other
structures;
         (B)    Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (C)    Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         (D)    Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (4)    Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Director.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (A)    Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater
discharges that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has
been approved by the Director.
         (B)    The creation of appropriately designed and constructed
stormwater management facility or drainage improvements on other properties,
public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities.
            (i)    These alternatives are available in combination or alone for
up to 0.6 inches of the original 1-inch at a ratio of 1 to 1.5, than that which
would be afforded by the waived on-site practices. If it is proven infeasible
to manage on site a portion of all the remaining 0.4-inches, off site
mitigation or payment in lieu will be applied at a 1:2 ratio for that portion.
There must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long- term
operation and maintenance of the off-site practice. The Director shall, to the
maximum extend practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site
practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management
practice.
         (C)    The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City
or the grant of an easement to the City, to be dedicated to preservation,
reforestation, and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
   (o)    Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices. Where the Director
waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, and the
applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an
amount as determined by the Director. This amount shall be 1.5 times for the
first 0.6-inches and 2 times the cost for remaining 0.4-inches of stormwater
management and based on the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater
management of the development in question. All of the monetary contributions
shall be credited to an appropriate stormwater capital improvements program
project, and shall be made by the applicant prior to the issuance of any
stormwater permit for the development.

   (a)    All owners of property to be rented or leased for residential
purposes shall inform the Town Clerk in writing on or before the I st day of
July each year of the manner in which the garbage fees for the property shall
be paid for the next twelve (12) month period (July 1 through June 30). There
shall be only two (2) lawful options for payment:
      (1)   The owner of the property shall be responsible for payment of all
garbage fees for each and every residential unit on the property; or
      (2)    The occupants of each and every residential unit on the propetty
shall be responsible for payment of all garbage fees. It shall be unlawful to
utilize both payment options.
   (b)    The rates and charges for garbage fees for each and every residential
unit shall be billed and paid by the owner of the property containing such
residential unit or units unless on or before the 1st day of July:
      (1)   The owner informs the Town Clerk in writing that the occupants will
be responsible for payment of all garbage fees for the next twelve (12) month
period (July 1 through June 30); and
      (2)    Each and every occupant of a residential unit on the property who
is responsible for payment of garbage fees files an application with the Town
Clerk for garbage services accompanied by an affidavit signed by both the
occupant and the owner showing the occupant's status and agreement to pay all
garbage fees for the residential unit (for residential units that are vacant as
of July 1, said application and affidavit shall be filed within ten (10) days
of the unit's occupancy). If such written information, application and
affidavit are not filed with the Town Clerk in a timely manner (on or before
July 1), the owner of the property shall be deemed the user of all garbage
service for each and every residential unit on the property for the next twelve
(12) month period (July 1 through June 30) and shall be responsible for paying
all garbage fees for the property.
   (c)    All occupants filing an application and an affidavit in accordance
with the preceding subsection must tender a refundable, non-interest bearing
deposit of twice (2x) the amount of the monthly rates and charges for such
residential unit. The deposit shall be refundable only if all fees are paid in
full in a timely manner. If fees are not paid in full in a timely manner, the
Town shall be entitled to apply the deposit to any such unpaid fees. Only the
remaining balance, if any, of the deposit (after being applied to unpaid fees)
shall be refundable.
   (d)    All owners shall be under a duty to cooperate with the Town in the
management and collection of garbage fees from the owners' occupants. If an
occupant of a residential unit, who has filed the application and affidavit in
accordance with subsection (b) and is responsible for payment of garbage fees,
fails to pay, the Town will mail a "Notice of Non-Payment" to both the occupant
and owner of said property advising that if full payment is not made within
thirty (30) days then garbage service will be terminated. Upon receipt of the
Notice of Non-Payment, the owner shall be obligated to immediately contact the
occupant and instruct the occupant to make full payment to the Town.
   In the event full payment is not made within thirty (30) days of the date of
the Notice of Non-Payment, the Town will post a "Notice of Termination" on the
front door of the occupant's unit and mail a Notice of Termination to the
owner. Garbage service will be terminated five (5) days after the date of said
notice unless all fees are paid in full. Upon receipt of the Notice of
Termination, the owner shall be obligated to immediately notify the occupant
that the occupant is prohibited from using any garbage service associated with
the propetty until all fees have been paid in full and service has been
reinstated. If the occupant is still residing at his/her residence thirty (30)
days after the date of Notice of Termination and has not paid in full the
garbage fees in arrears, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the occupant
has been unlawfully using the Town's garbage collection service and that the
owner of the residential unit has failed to cooperate with the Town.
   (e)    All owners of property with residential units and all tenants of
residential units shall be eligible for an 8.3% discount off the established
monthly garbage fees for the units by paying the total for twelve (12) months
garbage service fees in full (less the 8.3% discount) for the property (in case
of the owner) or the residential unit (in case of the tenant) on or before July
1. This payment shall be nonrefundable, regardless of the circumstances. The
discount described in this section shall not apply to any garbage overage
charges provided under Section
951.05(e).
   (f)    The Town of Star City may pursue any lawful means to collect the
unpaid garbage fees. Additionally, any owner or occupant who fails to comply
with this section, shall upon conviction) be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). (Passed 6-

ARTICLE 961
Procedure
 
961.01   Authority of Council.
961.02   Procedure and payment of costs.
961.01  AUTHORITY OF COUNCIL.
   Council is authorized and empowered to grade, regrade, pave or repave,
surface or resurface, curb or recurb, streets and alleys, and to build or renew
sidewalks, and to construct, provide or renew any of such improvements or other
permanent public improvements in any streets, alleys, public ways or easements
or any portions thereof in the Town.
(Passed 11-7-17.)
961.02 PROCEDURE AND PAYMENT OF COSTS.
   Whenever Council may deem it appropriate to cause any street or alley in the
Town, or portion thereof, to be graded, regraded, paved, repaved, surfaced or
resurfaced, curbed or recurbed, Council shall order the work done in the
following manner and upon the following terms:
   (a)   The contract for such grading, regrading, paving, repaving, surfacing,
resurfacing, curbing or recurbing shall, after due advertisement in which
Council shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids, be let, if let, to
the lowest and best bidder. The total amount of grading, regrading, paving,
repaving, surfacing, resurfacing, curbing or recurbing of any such street or
alley shall be borne by the Town and/or the abutting property owner(s), at the
option of Council, and the plan for payment is to be determined by Council,
before beginning the work, in such proportions as Council, in its sole
discretion, deems appropriate. If Council deems it appropriate to charge or
assess any or all of the cost on the abutting property owner(s), each abutting
property owner shall be responsible for paying a proportionate share of the
cost based on such abutting property owner's respective frontage on the street
or alley.
   (b)   If Council deems it appropriate to charge or assess the abutting
property owner(s) for any or all of the cost of the grading, regrading, paving,
repaving, surfacing, resurfacing, curbing or recurbing, then when the grading,
regrading, paving, repaving, surfacing, resurfacing, curbing or recurbing of
any street or alley or portion thereof shall have been let to contract and the
work done as hereinbefore provided, it shall be the duty of the Town's Public
Works Director to cause the frontages thereon to be measured, to calculate the
assessment, if any, upon each and every land owner so abutting, and to certify
the same to Council, showing the proper amount to be determined as provided in
the foregoing plan. It shall be the duty of Council to examine and compare such
assessments, amounts and names so certified to it. Thereupon Council shall give
notice by publication for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in
said Town that an assessment, under this Ordinance, is about to be made against
abutting property for grading, regrading, paving, repaving, surfacing,
resurfacing, curbing or recurbing done on said street or alley, describing the
location of the same. Any owner or owners of abutting property shall have the
right to appear before Council, within three weeks from the first publication
thereof, and move Council to correct any apportionment or assessments
improperly made; which corrections Council shall have the power to make. If
found to be correct, or when rectified, Council shall cause the same to be
entered, together with the description as to the location, frontage, depth and
ownership of land, so far as the same may be ascertained, upon its record, and
to enter in its record, that such owners and lots be assessed and chargeable
with the amounts so ascertained to be borne by them respectively. When so
approved, certified and entered of record, the same shall be and constitute an
assessment against said owners and lots for such respective amounts. It shall
be the duty of Council to immediately certify such assessment to Town Treasurer
for collection as hereinbefore provided. A copy of such order shall be
certified by the recorder to the Clerk of the County Court of Monongalia
County, who shall be required to record and index the same in the proper deed
book in the name of each person against whose property assessments appear
therein. The amount so assessed against any land owners, as aforesaid, shall be
paid in ten installments as follows; that is to say: One-tenth thereof, within
sixty days from the date the same is certified to the Treasurer; one-tenth
thereof, with interest from day of entry, on the first day of October next
ensuing, and one-tenth thereof, with interest from the date of entry payable
October first of each year, on the first day of October in each year thereafter
until the whole thereof shall have been paid; provided, however, that any owner
or owners so liable for any part of such grading, regrading, paving, repaving,
surfacing, resurfacing, curbing or recurbing shall have the right at any time
after certification as aforesaid to anticipate the payment of such installment,
or any of them, and to discount the same for cash on the basis of two and one-
half percent (2 1/2%). To each of such installments remaining unpaid in the
Treasurer's hands at the time specified for such payment, a penalty of five
percent (5%), together with six percent (6%) per annum interest until paid,
shall be added; and payment thereof enforced in all respects as hereinbefore
provided for the collection of any other taxes due the Town and such shall be a
lien upon the property liable therefor, the same as for other taxes, and the
lien may be enforced in the same manner as provided for the taxes.
   (c)   The liens hereinbefore provided for shall have priority over all other
liens, except those for taxes due the State and County, and shall be on a
parity with other taxes and assessments due the Town. Upon the payment of any
assessment to the Treasurer, the Treasurer shall deliver to the parties paying
the same a release of the lien therefor, which may be recorded in the County
Clerk's office as other releases of liens.
   (d)   This Article shall be interpreted in accordance with the requirements
of West Virginia Code, including, in particular, West Virginia Code §8-18-1, et
seq. If any section, clause, paragraph, sentence or phrase of this Article
shall, for any reason, be held to be in invalid or unconstitutional, such
invalid or unconstitutional section, clause, paragraph, sentence or phrase is
hereby declared to be severable; and any such invalid or unconstitutional
section, clause, paragraph, sentence or phrase shall in no way affect the
remainder of this Article; and it is hereby declared to be the intention of
Council that the remainder of this Article would have been passed
notwithstanding the invalidity or unconstitutionality of any section, clause,
paragraph, sentence or phrase thereof.

distance already established by such existing commercial buildings shall not be
required.
   (f)   In the "B" residence district, where part of the lots fronting on one
side of a street between two intersecting streets are within a retail business
district and part within a residence district, a front yard provided for a lot

improvements to the buffer space as may be required by the Town’s Building
Inspector.
   (g)   As used in this Ordinance, the terms “abut” and “abutting” shall mean:
having a common border with, or being separated from such a common border only

      (2)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate minimum construction
practices in order to prevent or minimize flooding damage.
      (3)   Minimize danger to public health and safety by protecting the water
supply and sanitary sewage disposal in cooperation with the County Sanitarian,
and to protect natural drainage.
      (4)   Assure the County Assessor obtains information concerning
improvement of real property as required by WV Code §11-3-3a.
       (5)   Assure all County E-911 addresses are obtained and kept current to
maintain the established emergency response dispatch systems.
      (6)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the residents, real property
owners and its governmental units by preventing the unwise design and
construction of development in areas subject to flooding.
   (b)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any
other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is
any conflict between any of the provisions of this Ordinance, the more
restrictive shall apply.
   (c)   Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any contractor, person,
partnership, business, or corporation to undertake or cause to be undertaken,
any development, new construction, substantial improvement, repair of
substantial damage, other repairs, or the placement or relocation of any
structure (including manufactured homes) within the Town of Star City unless a
permit application has been completed and a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator. In addition, where land is partially or fully in the
Floodplain is to be developed, subdivided, utilized for a manufactured home
park or subdivision or otherwise developed, a site plan with elevation data
must be submitted to, and approved by, the Floodplain Administrator prior to
any development.
   Provision of all other codes, ordinances, and regulations shall be
applicable insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of this Ordinance
and the Town's need to minimize the hazards and damage resulting from flooding.
   (d)   Matters Not Provided for Specifically. Where conditions are
encountered that are not specifically provided for herein, the Floodplain
Administrator shall determine the applicability of the provisions of this
Ordinance in accordance with its intent and shall require the applicant to take
appropriate measures pursuant to such determination. (Passed 4-23-19)
1701.02 INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used
in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give this Ordinance it's most
reasonable application.
      (1)   "Adjacent Property" includes any surface tract, regardless of
whether such surface tract is entirely within the Town of Star City, so long as
a portion of said surface tract is located within the Town of Star City, which
shares an immediate and common boundary up or down stream to the property that
is the subject of the application for Floodplain Permit. Adjacent property also
includes all other property that may be affected by flooding.
      (2)   "Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties." To adversely affect a
property the increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation
must be more than 1 foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect is that
the 100-year flood base flood elevation rises 1 foot or less the property is
not "affected". This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If prior permit
(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the above
definition would include the cumulative impact to the base flood elevation.
      (3)   "Appurtenant Structure." A structure on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental and used for
storage only to the use of the principal structure. This does not include a gas
or liquid storage tank. These structures cannot be used as living space.
      (4)   "Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      (5)   "Base Flood Elevation (BFE)." The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance
Rate Map. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the one hundred (100) year flood
or 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (See 100 year flood
also).
      (6)   "Basement." Any area of the building having its floor sub grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (7)   "Certificate of Compliance." A certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (8)   "Compensatory storage." An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the special flood hazard area.
      (9)   "Contractor" (W.Va. Code §21-11-3(c)" means a person who in any
capacity for compensation, other than as an employee of another, undertakes,
offers to undertake, purports to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a
bid to construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or
demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who
performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.
         "Contractor" does not include:
         A.   One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without
fabricating or consuming them in the construction project;
          B.   A person who personally performs construction work on the site
of real property which the person owns or leases whether for commercial or
residential purposes;

functions under the control of any other licensing or regulatory board, whose
primary business is real estate sales, appraisal, development, management and
maintenance, who acting in his respective professional capacity and any
employee of such professional, acting in the course of his employment, performs
any work which may be considered to be performing contracting work;
         D.   A pest control operator licensed under the provisions of W.Va.
Code §19-16A-7(a) to engage in the application of pesticides for hire, unless
the operator also performs structural repairs exceeding one thousand dollars on
property treated for insect pests; or
         E.   A corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship whose primary purpose is to prepare construction plans and
specifications used by the contractors defined in this section and who employs
a full time registered architect licensed to practice in this State or a
registered professional engineer licensed to practice in this State. Contractor
also does not include employees of such corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship.
      (10)   "Critical Facility." Any facility in which even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include hospitals,
fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, and similar
facilities.
         These should be given special consideration when formulating
regulatory alternatives and floodplain management plans. A critical facility
should not be located in a special flood hazard area if at all possible. If a
critical facility must be located in a special flood hazard area it should be
provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and
provide services during a flood.
      (11)   "Development." Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
property, including but not limited to buildings or other structure, mining,

subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A,
AE, AO, A1-30, and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard
maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this Ordinance.
      (40)   "Start of Construction." (The definition for start of construction
is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.)
          The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain
Permit for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual

liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
      (44)   "Subdivision." Development that includes a creation of individual
land parcels for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-
way or easements are obtained and recorded.
      (45)   "Subject Property." "Subject property" includes the surface tract
(s) upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
      (46)   "Substantial Damage." Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
      (47)   "Substantial Improvement." Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the start of construction of the improvement.
         This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation(s) of State or
          Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code Specifications which have been
identified by the Local Code Enforcement Official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   "Top of Bank." The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating
each side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   "Variance." A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
      (50)   "Violation." The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all requirements of this Ordinance. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as the documentation is provided. No future
improvements or developments can be made to structures found to be in violation
unless the development is to bring the structure into compliance with the
current ordinance.

1701.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification. The identified special flood hazard area shall be
those areas of the Town of Star City which are subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for
the Town of Star City by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated
April 5, 2019 or the most recent revision thereof including all digital data
developed as part of the FIS. The identified special flood hazard area shall
also be those special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood
hazard areas by the Town of Star City by use of historic or other technical
data and shown on an officially recognized "FIRM or the West Virginia Flood
Hazard Determination Tool Specifically Advisory Flood Height data. These areas
shall be designated as appropriate with the level of technical data described
below and shall be managed accordingly.
 
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
      (5)   The AO and AH floodplain are those areas identified as Zones AO and
AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-
percent-annual- chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one
and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to
guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the Town of Star City where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A County's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six months from the date such information becomes available, the
County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
      (3)   The Town of Star City may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
 
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is at
or above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the
Floodplain Administrator:
         i.   Elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation, or
         ii.   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site
from the SHFA, then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain
Area and shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the County Commission
sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant. (Passed 4-23-19)
1701.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
       (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
(3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken in
strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the Town of
Star City Floodplain Manager, be determined to be the channel of the stream and
the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special
flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the
upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, Town of Star City's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the Town of Star City in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in
1701.08 (d) of this Ordinance.
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.

   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered

of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement
shall state:
            (i)   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
            (ii)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through

requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            (i)   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            (ii)   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.

- used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only).
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            (i)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            (ii)   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non- Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non- Conversion Agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1701.08(d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
         Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area. (Passed 4-23-19)

         B.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
Section
1701.08 (d).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
       (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick, disconnected utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
   (e)   Fill. The Town of Star City officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
   No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not result
in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
       (1)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed  by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
         A   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
          B.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
         C.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
         D.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion
problems.
         E.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining
whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and adjacent
properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography,
stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
      (2)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (3)   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
      (4)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection 5 below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
      (5)   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
      (6)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
      (7)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary stability
and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction standards must
be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention is necessary
when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
      (8)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (9)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
          A.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
         B.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
      (10)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
      (11)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
       (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH and
AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area. (Passed 4-23-19)

other authorized County, State or Federal Government Officials may inspect the
premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the
information provided on the Floodplain Permit Application, this Ordinance and
with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, Regulations and Ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this Ordinance or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order
Notice", revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of Monongalia County, West Virginia. The Floodplain Administrator shall
notify any appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator
finds a violation of any non-Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized County, State or
Federal Government Officials may inspect any development covered by this or
previous Floodplain Ordinances to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be non-compliant with the requirements of this
or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1701.08(d).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the utility inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of
Compliance issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.
Inspection and approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in Section
1701.08(d).
      (3)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1701.08(d).
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the

construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   Floodplain Determination fee of ($20.00), payable to the Monongalia
County Commission shall be assessed on all proposed development.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood

payable to Town of Star City based upon a set schedule approved by the Town of
Star City using the estimated value of the proposed construction as determined
by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
Town of Star City for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
         Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the Town of Star City for the additional
cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover
this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by
the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

decision of the Floodplain Administrator as announced at a regularly scheduled
Town of Star City Council Meeting. Said Appeal shall be served by the aggrieved
person by regular mail on all interested parties on the date that said Appeal
is filed. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Floodplain Appeals Board shall set a
time, date and place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar
days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time, date and place
of the hearing shall be given to all interested parties by placing an

the date, time and place of the appeal hearing not sooner than 10 calendar days
from said announcement date, at which time all may appear and be heard. The
determination by the Floodplain Appeals Board shall be final in all cases,
subject to any Appeal to the Town Council of Town of Star City, West Virginia
or any other Court of competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator shall
immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a
resolution of said appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this
Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the Town of Star City Flood Plane Appeals Board (to be
appointed by the Mayor each year) may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements.
    Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this Ordinance shall adhere
to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this Ordinance; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)   Penalties. Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Ordinance or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the Town of Star City of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this Ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this Ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
non-compliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in non-compliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the Town
of Star City to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to other
applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.
