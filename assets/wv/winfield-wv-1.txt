EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Winfield Codified Ordinances is indicated.

and exercise all the powers and perform all the duties vested by law in a
justice of the peace, except that he shall have no jurisdiction in civil cases
of causes of action arising out of the corporate limits of the Town. He shall
have the same power to issue attachments in civil suits as a Justice of Putnam
County has, though the cause of action arose out of the Town, but in such case
he shall have no power to try the same, but said attachment shall be returnable
and be heard before some Justice of Putnam County. Any warrant or other
process, issued by him may be executed at any place within the County. He shall
have control of the police of the Town, and may appoint special police officers
whenever he deems it necessary; and it shall be his duty especially to see that

property therein are protected, and to this end he may cause the arrest and
detention of all riotous and disorderly persons in the Town before issuing his
warrant therefore. He shall have power to issue execution for all fines,
penalties and costs imposed by him or he may require the immediate payment
thereof; and in default of such payment, he may commit the party in default to
the jail of Putnam County, or other place of imprisonment in said corporation,
if there be one, until the fine or penalty and costs shall be paid; but the
term of imprisonment in such case shall not exceed thirty days. He shall from
time to time, recommend to the Council such measures as he may deem needful for
the welfare of the Town. The expenses of maintaining any person committed to
the jail of the County by him, except it be to answer an indictment, or be
under the provisions of Sections Two Hundred and Twenty-Seven and Two Hundred
and Twenty-Eight of Chapter Fifty of the Code of West Virginia, shall be paid
by the Town. But the Mayor shall not receive any money belonging to the State,
or to individuals, unless he shall give the bond and security required of a
justice of the peace by Chapter Fifty of the Code of West Virginia; and all the
provisions of said Chapter relating to moneys received by justices shall apply
as to like moneys received by said Mayor.

all his powers.

shall list the number of dogs in the Town, and the names of the persons owning
the same, which list shall be returned to the Council.

perform any labor on the roads outside of the corporate limits of the Town; nor
shall the inhabitants of said Town or while it provides for its own poor, be
required to pay any poor levies assessed by the County Court for the support of
the poor outside of said corporate limits; but beyond this the taxable property
in said Town shall not be exempt from the payment of County levies for any
purpose for which such levy may be lawfully laid, by reason of any provisions
in its Charter or act of incorporation, or otherwise.
SECTION 33 CONDEMNATION PROCEDURES.
   The condemnation of real estate for roads, streets, alleys, drains, and
gutters in said corporation, shall be as prescribed in Chapter Forty-Two of the
Code of West Virginia, and shall be at the expense of the corporation. And it
is further adjudged, ordered and decreed that the Council of the Town of

   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified

ratify and adopt said State defined purposes as being the same purposes of this

State purposes herein.
   (b)   Council further hereby finds that for the purpose of assisting in the
administration of the provisions of this article, that various statutory
sections of the aforesaid State Act shall be hereby expressly adopted and
incorporated as provisions of this article, except as otherwise expressly

adopted and incorporated herein are as follows: (1) 6B-1-1 through 5; and (2)

   (c)   Notwithstanding the affirmation and adoption of the purposes of the
State Act and further the specific adoption of the selected, statutory sections

of lobbyists, and which said statutory provisions the Council hereby expressly

amendments.

304.01   Traffic school.
304.01 TRAFFIC SCHOOL.
   (a)   Purpose; Fee.  
      (1)   The purpose of authorizing and conducting a traffic school is to
allow first time individuals who have been cited for minor moving traffic
violations within the Town the opportunity, in lieu of facing and experiencing
prosecution, to be educated and become better aware of traffic safety and the
proper being of all persons traveling the roadways of the Town. The traffic
school program hereby authorized shall be under the administrative control of
the Municipal Court and under the operational supervision of the Chief of
Police.
      (2)   Any individual who wishes to attend the traffic school shall first
pay to the Town an administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). No one may
attend the traffic school who has not paid such administrative fee in advance.
There may be an additional fee required to be paid to the instructor of the
traffic school, which said fee shall be paid in accordance with the
instructor’s requirements.
   (b)   Guidelines. Any person charged with a minor traffic offense (defined
below) may: plead guilty, plead not guilty, plead nolo contendre (with the
consent of the Municipal Judge); or attend traffic school. Any individual who
elects to attend traffic school must pay the administrative fee for the school,
in full, prior to attending the school. Upon the individual’s satisfactory
completion of the traffic school, the charge will be placed on the open docket
of the Municipal Court and allowed to expire without prosecution. Thus, a
person who satisfactorily completes the traffic school will not incur any DMV
points against their operator’s license and will not have a record of the
citation or charge with DMV.
      (1)   The traffic school’s curriculum will include instruction in basic
traffic laws and rules of the road, defensive driving, hazard recognition and
avoidance, driver reaction, general traffic safety and courteous operation of
motor vehicles.
      (2)   Persons attending the Town’s traffic school are required to attend
a session which will not have duration of more than two hours. At the
completion of traffic school the instructor will provide each satisfactory
attendee with evidence of satisfactory completion of the course. Each attendee
must then provide the Municipal Judge or Municipal Court Clerk with a copy of
such evidence of satisfactory completion in order to have original charge/
citation placed on the Court’s open docket for expiration without prosecution.
The citation or charge against any attendee who fails to satisfactorily
complete traffic school will be immediately placed upon the Municipal Court’s
Docket for further action.
      (3)   Traffic school must be satisfactorily completed within sixty days
of the attendee’s election to attend, unless otherwise approved for special
circumstances by the Municipal Judge. The place, date and times for traffic
school will be posted in a conspicuous location at Town Hall and at the Police
Department.
      (4)   Minor traffic offenses for which a person may elect to attend
traffic school in lieu of prosecution generally include any traffic offenses
for which a conviction would result in the assessment of up to three points of
the individual’s driving record with DMV, i.e., certain speeding violations,
failure to obey a traffic signal/sign, or similar minor offenses. Traffic
school shall not be an option for offenders charged with driving under the
influence of alcohol or drugs, driving while license suspended/revoked,
vehicular homicide, citations involving a traffic accident, or such other
offenses as deemed necessary by the Municipal Judge.

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.

crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or

section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11A-

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten

this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.

appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor

Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section 333.01 or
West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section shall be
without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,

occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking

designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.

misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

and the surety.

was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written
application signed by a juvenile, and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible,

believes that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other
circumstances, no exception or defense in subsection (d) or (e) is present.

unconstitutionality of invalidity shall not effect the remaining portions of
this section. Council hereby declares that it would have enacted the remaining
portions regardless of whether any part of this ordinance is declared

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment

or death.

transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

Permit Officer to request the assistance of the County Prosecuting Attorney

greater restrictions than those of any other ordinance or regulation, the
provisions of this article shall be controlling. Where the provisions of any
statute, other ordinance or regulation propose greater restrictions than this
article, the provisions of such statute, ordinance or regulation shall be
controlling. This article shall not be construed in any manner that is not
consistent with the purpose and provisions of State law governing the licensing
and maintenance of salvage yards.
   (c)   Severability. If any article, section, subsection, paragraph, clause
or provisions of this article shall be declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such decisions shall not affect the validity of
this article as a whole or any other part thereof.

such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer,
within two years from the time the tax was paid, and not thereafter.
Notwithstanding such period of limitation, the taxpayer may file a claim for
refund within ninety days after a final determination by the state tax
department of an overpayment in the taxpayers state business and occupation tax
liability.
   (b)   If, on such petition and the proofs filed in support thereof, the city
collector shall be of the opinion that the tax, interest or penalty, or any
part thereof, was overpaid, he shall refund the same to the taxpayer. If the
city collector shall be in doubt as to whether or not there exists an
overpayment, he may institute against the taxpayer a declaratory judgment
proceeding in the circuit court of the county to ascertain whether or not there
exists an overpayment of tax, interest or penalty, or any party thereof. If the
city collector is of the opinion that there exists no overpayment of tax,
interest or penalty, or any part thereof, he shall notify the taxpayer.
   (c)   Taxpayer's failure to abide by express procedures contained in this
section precludes taxpayer's claim for refund or credit.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.04 OFFENSES.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to make the return required to

any part thereof, imposed by this article, or for the president, vice
president, secretary, or treasurer of any corporation to make or permit to be
made for any corporation or association any false return, or any false
statement in any return required in this article, with the intent to evade the
payment of any tax hereunder.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.05 REVOCATION OF LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   (a)    The City Collector has the authority to revoke any and all licenses
and permits issued by the city in the event a licensee/permittee fails to file
any City tax return or fails to pay any delinquent taxes, fees or any interest
or penalty thereon due and owing to the city. The City Collector has the
authority to deny and prevent any and all licenses and permit privileges to
those persons who are delinquent in paying taxes, fees or any interest or
penalty thereon due and owing the City.
   (b)   In the event of revocation, the City Collector will provide written
notice to the licensee/permittee at least five days prior to the contemplated
revocation and such notice shall be served by certified mail. The notice shall
indicate the time and the place of the revocation review meeting, the general
grounds of said contemplated revocation, and shall advise the licensee/
permittee of his/her rights to appear at said hearing in person and represented
by legal counsel, and to be heard orally upon the merits of his/her defense.
The City Collector may request legal advice from the City Attorney's office,
and adopt such procedures for its decorum and the dispatch of business at such
hearings as he/she may regard advisable. The revocation decision of the City
Collector will be final; provided, that those licensees/permittees who are
subject to administrative or judicial appeals, pursuant to this ordinance may
utilize these procedures in accordance with the Code, but will not be grounds
to delay the revocation process.
   (c)   Each license or permit that has been revoked pursuant to this section
may be re- issued upon payment of all delinquent B&O taxes, fees or any
interest or penalty thereon due and owing to the City. (Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed
3-20-06.)

741.07 IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.
   (a)    There are hereby levied and imposed and shall be collected annual
privilege taxes, against the persons, on account of the business and other
activities and in the amounts to be determined by the application of rates
against values or gross income or gross proceeds as set forth in this article.
   (b)   If any person liable for any tax under this article shall ship or
transport his products, or any part thereof, out of the City without making
sale of such products, the value of the products in the condition or form in
which they exist immediately before transportation out of the City shall be the
basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in those sections.
   (c)   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under this article,
except in the production of natural gas, shall neither be added nor deducted in
computing the tax levied under the other sections of this article.
   (d)   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and the seller is such that the gross proceeds from
the sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the
sale, the value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied shall correspond
as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products
of like quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer
and the seller but where the circumstances or conditions are otherwise similar.
   (e)   Sufficiency of Contacts. The municipal business and occupation tax is
imposed on each person engaged in privileges taxable under this article if such
person is engaged in purposive revenue generating activities within the
municipal limits of the City and such person has sufficient contacts to sustain
the City's taxing jurisdiction. By way of example (but not limitation), if a
person's activities within the city contributes to the establishment and
maintenance of a market, such contacts are considered to be sufficient to
sustain the city's taxing jurisdiction assuming federal constitutional nexus
standards are satisfied.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.08 PRODUCERS OF NATURAL RESOURCE PRODUCTS.
   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of severing, extracting, mining, quarrying, reducing to possession
and/or producing for sale, profit or commercial use any natural resource
products, the amount of such tax shall be equal of the value of the articles
produced as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the
producer, except as hereinafter provided, multiplied by the respective rates as

percent; oil, 3 percent; natural gas in excess of the value of $5,000.00, 6
percent; blast furnace slag, 3 percent; sand gravel or other mineral products,

   (b)   The measure of this tax is the value of the entire production in the
City, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that delivery may be made to
points outside the city.
   (c)   A person exercising privileges taxable under this section and using or
consuming the same in his business or transferring or delivering the same as
any royalty paid, in kind, or the like, shall be deemed to be engaged in the
business of producing natural resources and shall be required to make returns
on account of the production of the business, showing the gross proceeds or
equivalent in accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the
value upon which privilege taxes shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as
possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like
quality or character by other taxpayers.
   (d)   Persons who produce natural resource products outside the city and who
make sale of the same within the city shall not pay the tax imposed by this
section but shall pay the tax imposed by Section

his natural resource products to producers of natural resources, manufacturers,
wholesalers, jobbers, retailers or commercial consumers for use or consumption
in the purchaser's business shall be required to make returns of the gross
proceeds of such wholesale sales and pay the tax imposed in Section
741.10.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)

   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of manufacturing, compounding or preparing for sale, profit or
commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or
part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or
commodities, or newspaper publishing (including all gross income or proceeds of
sale from circulation and advertising), except electric power produced by
public utilities or others, the amount of the tax shall be equal to the value

manufactured goods in the City.
   (c)   The measure of the tax in this section is the value of the entire
product manufactured, compounded or prepared in the City for sale; profit or
commercial use, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may
be made to points outside the City.
   (d)   It is further provided, however, that in those instances in which the
same person partially manufacturers, compounds or prepares products within the
City and partially manufactures, compounds or prepares such products outside
the City, the measure of his tax under this section shall be that proportion of
the sales price of the product that the payroll costs of manufacturing within
the City bears to the entire payroll costs of manufacturing the product.
   (e)   A person exercising any privilege taxable under this section and
engaging in the business of selling his product at retail in the City shall be
required to make returns of the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the
tax imposed in Section
741.10 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such products
at retail in the City.
   (f)   The dressing and processing of food intended for human consumption by

   (g)   Persons who manufacture, compound or prepare products outside the City
and who make sale of the same within the City shall not pay the tax imposed by
this section but shall pay tax imposed by section 1.10 for the privilege of
selling such product within the City. If any person shall ship or transport his

and uniform rules of ascertaining such value. To determine whether freight
charges are deductible, see §§ 110-26-2b.6 of the Code of State Regulations.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.10 BUSINESS OF SELLING TANGIBLE PROPERTY; CERTAIN SALES EXEMPT.
   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of selling any tangible property whatsoever, real or personal,
including the sale of food in hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, confectioneries
and other public eating houses and wholesale sales from a rolling stockpile,
except sales of any person engaging or continuing in the business of
horticulture, agriculture or grazing, or selling stocks, bonds, or other
evidence of indebtedness, there is hereby levied, and shall be collected, a tax
equal to .25 percent of the gross income of the business; except, therein the
case of selling at wholesale, the tax shall be equal to .15 percent of the
gross income of the business.
   (b)   Gross income or gross proceeds of sales derived from sales within West
Virginia, which is not taxed or taxable by any other municipality are included
in the measure of City business and occupation tax if the sales are either
directed from a City location or the taxpayer's principal West Virginia office
is located in the City. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, when
the taxpayer has only one office location and this office is located within the
municipal limits of the City and its activities elsewhere in West Virginia are
neither taxed nor taxable by another municipality, the gross income or gross
proceeds from those activities are taxable by the City.
   (c)   A person exercising any privilege taxable under this article, and
engaging in the business of selling his manufactured products in the City,
shall be required to make returns of the gross proceeds of such wholesale sales
and pay the tax imposed by this section at the rate of .15 percent for the
privilege of engaging in the business of selling such manufactured products in
the City.
   (d)   All sales of real estate (such as by a speculative builder) are sales
at retail and must be reported accordingly. On sales of realty, the status of
the purchaser or the intention or use made of the property by the purchaser is
of no consequence to the vendor's tax status. To illustrate; where a
speculative builder constructs apartment buildings which he later sells to a
tax exempt entity, such sales must be reported at retail on the tax return of
the speculative builder.
   (e)   Casual sales of real estate are not taxable to the vendor.
   (f)   Sales of tangible personal property made by vendors to persons
engaging in exempt business activities (e.g., non profit hospitals and the
activities of agriculture, horticulture, grazing) are not exempt sales and the
gross income derived from such sales must be reported by the vendor under the
retail classification. This rule results from the fact that the purchaser (non-
profit hospital, farmer, etc.) is not engaged in a business subject to the
municipal business and occupation tax.
   (g)   All sales made through vending machines are sales at retail. The term
"vending machines" means and includes only those machines which, through the
insertion of a coin of a specified amount, will return to the vendee a
predetermined specific article of merchandise. It includes, but is not limited
to, machines which vend cigarette, toilet articles, sandwiches, beverages,
candies, confections, et cetera.
   (h)   Persons domiciled outside the City limits of the City who solicit
sales within the City and sell tangible personal property of the City are doing
business in the City, irrespective of the domicile of such persons irrespective
of whether or not such persons maintain a permanent place of business in the
City and irrespective of how a sales order is transmitted or processed. If an
order is placed in connection with solicitation by a representative (regardless
whether there is an employment or agency relationship or whether acting as an
independent contractor) who solicits orders within the City, and the tangible
personal property is to be delivered in the City, then the gross proceeds of
such sales are included in the measure of the City's business and occupation
tax.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.11 PUBLIC SERVICE OR UTILITY BUSINESS.
   Upon any person engaging or continuing within the City in any public service
or utility business, except railroad, railroad car, express, pipeline,
telephone and telegraph companies, water carriers by steamboat or steamship and
motor carriers, there are levied, and shall be collected, taxes on account of
the business engaged in equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by
the respective rates as follows: Water companies, 2 percent; electric light and
power companies, 2 percent on sales and demand charges for domestic and
commercial lighting and 2 percent on sales and demand charges for all other
purposes; natural gas companies, 2 percent of the gross income, such gross
income for this purpose to be determined by deducting from gross income from
all sales of gas to consumers the amount of the tax paid by the taxpayer under
Section
741.08 upon the production of the same gas; and upon all other public service
or utility business, 1 percent. The measure of this tax shall not include gross
income derived from commerce between the state and other states of the United
States. The measure of the tax under this section shall include only gross
income received from the supplying of public service. The gross income of the
taxpayer from any other activity shall be included in the measure of the tax
imposed upon such other activity by the appropriate section of this article.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.12 BUSINESS OF CONTRACTING.
   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to one percent (1%) of the
gross income of the business. A person performing any contracting activity
shall report his/her gross income therefrom under the contracting
classification of the municipal business and occupation tax return and shall
receive no deduction from gross income on the account of any expenses incurred.
All income derived from said activity shall be reported under the contracting
classification, and the form of contract entered into by the parties shall not
be determinative of taxable classification.
      (1)    For Registered Vacant Structures with in the city. Once demolition
is performed and rebuild occurs within twenty-four (24) months of demolition,
the one percent (1%) of gross income on contracting will be waived.
         (Ord. 2021-2022-5. Passed 11-9-21.)
   (b)   Form of Contract. Persons engaged in the contracting business shall
report the entire gross income under the contracting classification, regardless
of whether the contract is a turnkey contract, lump sum contract, per unit
contract, cost plus fixed fee contract, or other contract having a similar
basis. Gross income received from a contracting activity must be reported under
the contracting classification and the manner of performance, basis of
determining cost, fee or income or form of contract shall not alter the
definition of contractor or of contracting and shall not change the taxability
of such income from the contracting classification to another classification. A
contracting activity remains a contracting activity regardless of what the
parties may name it and regardless of the manner in which the parties may make
payment and perform work.
   (c)   Costs. The measure of the tax under the contracting classification is
gross income and includes all items of cost where the contractor has incurred
liability. The cost of materials and labor can only be exempted from the
measure of the tax in those cases where the contractor is not liable to vendors
or workmen for payment. In those cases where the contractor contends that he/
she has not incurred a municipal business and occupation tax liability because
he/she acted solely as a agent for the owner, the burden of proving alleged
principal-agency relationship shall be upon the contractor.
   (d)   Separate Contracts for Labor and Materials. In cases where the
contractor enters into a separate contract for the furnishing of materials by
the contractor and a separate contract for erection of such materials by the
contractor, the gross income from both contracts is taxable under the
contracting classification, unless it can be provided by the contractor that
passage of title of the materials was not dependent upon the erection of the
materials by the contractor and that the sale of such materials is, in fact, a
separate and distinct transaction, taxable under the municipal business and
occupation tax law, as a retail or wholesale sale, as the case may be. The
contract to furnish materials shall not be considered a separate and distinct
transaction from the contract to erect the same, unless it is established by
the contractor to be a complete arm's length transaction with no dependency
existing between the contract for materials and the contract for erection. The
burden of proving any alleged arm's length transaction shall be upon the
contractor. 
   (e)   Separate Purchase Orders. A separate purchase order for the furnishing
of work or labor and a separate purchase order for the furnishing of materials
which constitutes the contract(s) between the parties shall be treated in the
same manner as set forth in the paragraph above.
   (f)   Prime and Subcontractors. A prime contractor, one who furnishes work
or both materials and work under a written or oral contract, for the
construction, alteration, repair, decoration or improvement of a new or
existing building or structure or any part thereof, or for the alteration,
improvement or development of realty, must report his/her gross income under
the contracting classification without any deduction on account of any expenses
incurred. If the prime contractor executes a contract with another for a
portion of the job or project, the prime contractor receives no deduction from
gross income on account of any payment made to the subcontractor. The
subcontractor will also be taxed on his/her gross income under the contracting
classification. (Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
   (g)   Contract Entered into with Government.   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former
subsection (g) hereof was repealed by Ordinance 2008-2009-2, passed April 21,

741.13 BUSINESS OF OPERATING AMUSEMENTS.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the business of
operating a theater, opera house, moving picture show, vaudeville, amusement
park, carnival, circus, dance hall, skating rink, racetrack, radio broadcasting
station or any other place at which amusements are offered to the public, the
tax shall be equal to .5 of one percent of the gross income of the business.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.14 SERVICE BUSINESS OR CALLING NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY TAXED.
   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in any
service business or calling not otherwise specifically taxed under this
article, there is hereby levied, and shall be collected, a tax equal to one
percent of the gross income of any such business.
   (b)   Gross income or gross proceeds of sales derived from services within
West Virginia which is not taxed or taxable by any other municipality are
included in the measure of the City business and occupation tax if the services
are either directed from a Winfield location or the taxpayer's principal West
Virginia office is located in the City. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, when a taxpayer has only one (1) office location and this office is
located within the municipal limits of the City and its activities elsewhere in
West Virginia are neither taxed nor taxable by another municipality, the gross
income or gross proceeds from those activities are taxable by the City.

business of furnishing any real or tangible personal property which has a tax
situs in the City, or any interest therein, for hire, loan, lease or otherwise,
whether the return is in the form of rentals, royalties, fees or otherwise, the
tax shall be one percent of the gross income of any such activity.
   (b)   The term "tangible personal property", as used herein, shall not
include money or public securities.

741.17 BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL BUSINESSES; FINDINGS OF CITY COUNCIL.
   (a)    Upon every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of banking or financial business, from and after July 1, 1971, the tax

premiums, discounts, dividends, service fees or charges, commissions, fines,
rents from real or tangible personal property, however denominated, royalties,
charges for bookkeeping or data processing, receipts from check sales, charges
or fees, and receipts from the sale of tangible personal property; provided,
that gross income shall not include:
      (1)   Interest received on the obligations of the United States, its
agencies and instrumentalities;
      (2)   Interest received on the obligations of this or any other state,
territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of
any of the foregoing or of the District of Columbia; or
      (3)   Interest received on investments or loans primarily secured by
first mortgages or deeds of trust on residential property occupied by non
transients; provided further, that all interest derived on activities exempt
under (3) above, shall be reported, as to amounts, on the return of a person
taxable under the provision of this section.
   (b)   Gross income of a banking or financial business, from whatever source
derived, shall be taxable under this section only.
   (c)   The City Council hereby finds and declares that it is the intent of
the Council to subject national banking associations and other financial
organizations to the tax imposed by this article, in accordance with the
authorization contained in Section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States as amended by Public Law 91-156, enacted December 24, 1969.
      (1)   Standards for reporting banking business income. Each person
engaging in banking business in the City that also maintains a banking location
outside the City shall make a good faith allocation of its gross income in
accordance with this article, subject to the approval of the City Collector.
Each person subject to this regulation shall report gross income for the City
municipal business and occupation tax purposes to reflect all gross income
generated from loans originated and services provided to customers at or
through each banking location within the municipal limits of the City and each
such person's report shall fully reflect gross income earned from investments
(other than loans) funded by deposits and repurchase agreements regularly
maintained at or through each banking location within the municipal limits of
the City. Other gross income shall be allocated in a reasonable manner that
attributes all income to banking locations. No allocation methodology used to
make such a report shall allocate or apportion gross income to locations other
than a banking location.
      (2)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
         A.   The phrase "banking location" (and all derivations thereof) means
a physical facility maintained by a person engaged in banking business at which
customers normally personally visit to conduct typical banking transactions,
such as opening accounts, originating loans, making deposits, etc.
         B.   Gross income from loans is reportable (without adjustment,
apportionment or allocation) to the banking location at which the loan
originates. The transfer of loan files to a location outside of a municipality
for processing or collection does not alter the taxability of the interest from
such loans with respect to the banking location at which such loans originate.
         C.   Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or
funded from deposits or repurchase agreements is reportable to banking location
(s) in which deposits giving rise to the income are maintained, regardless of
whether the investments function is managed or directed at a separate location.
Deposits and repurchase agreements are considered maintained only at banking
locations in accordance with reasonable procedures that reflect typical
customer deposit activities and repurchase agreement relationships maintained
at banking locations of the taxpayer subject to the approval of the City
Collector. Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or funded
from sources other than deposits or repurchase agreements shall be reported to
banking location(s) in a reasonable manner that fairly allocates all such gross
income to banking locations.
         D.   Gross income from fees is reportable to the banking location at
which the activity giving rise to the fee is primarily undertaken, using a
reasonable method that fully reports fee income to one or more banking
locations.
      (3)   The City Collector of the City shall have authority to review and
approve reasonable allocation methods in accordance with this article.
      (4)   Each person subject to this regulation shall establish and maintain
sufficient records for review by the City Collector and his or her designee as
long as the contents of such records may be material in the administration of
the municipal business and occupation tax of the City along with such
additional information as may otherwise be required. Each person subject to
this regulation shall file reports on such forms designed from time to time by
the City Collector and shall follow all instructions in connection therewith.

the gross volume of business in terms of gross receipts or in other terms and
in the determination of which deductions allowed would not constitute the tax
an income tax or value added tax and which is not, pursuant to law or custom,
separately stated from the sales price.

municipal limits of the City, whether such income is in the form of rentals or
royalties.

levied hereunder, may also require the following:
         A.   At the time of registration, each contractor shall deposit with
the City Collector six percent of the amount the contractor is to receive for
the performance of the contact, which sum shall be held within a contractor's

calling or activity, computing the amount of tax chargeable against him in
accordance with the provisions of this article and transmit with his report a
remittance in the sum required by this section, covering the remainder of the
tax chargeable against him, in the office of the City Collector. Such returns
shall be verified by the oath of the taxpayer, if made by an individual, or by
the oath of the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer of a
corporation, if made on behalf of the corporation. If made on behalf of a
partnership, joint venture, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm, group or
unit shall take the oath on behalf of the taxpayer.
   (b)   The assessment of taxes herein made and the returns required therefore
shall be for the year ending December 31. If the taxpayer, in exercising a

City Collector, make his annual returns and pay taxes for the year covering his
accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his books.

741.23 EXTENSIONS OF TIME; PAYMENT PLANS.
   (a)    The City Collector, upon approval from City Manager, may grant a
reasonable extension of time for payment of tax or any installment, or for

shall exceed six months.
   (b)   The City Collector, upon approval from City Manager, may extend the
time for payment of an amount determined as a deficiency for a period not to
exceed 12 months from the date designated for payment of the deficiency. An
extension of this time may be granted only where it is clearly established to
the satisfaction of the City Collector that the payment of a deficiency upon
the date designated for payment would result in undue hardship.
   (c)   If any extension of time is granted for payment of any tax or
deficiency, the City Collector may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or
other security, in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the
extension of time for payment is granted on such terms and conditions as the

designated by the City Collector, any books, papers, records, memoranda or
other documents bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return

keeping of records, the content and form of returns and the filing of copies of

or not such person is liable under this article for such tax.

subpoenas duces tecum to compel the attendance of witnesses and production of
documents for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a tax return or
for performing an assessment or for any hearing held by the Tax Collector. In
case of the failure or refusal of a witness to appear and testify or to produce
evidence, the City Collector may invoke the aid of the Putnam County Circuit

the witness to appear and give testimony and produce evidence concerning the
matter in question.

of the City Collector issued thereunder.

writing, waive the secrecy provisions of this section for such purpose and such

particulars filed under the provisions of the tax articles administered under
the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.26 RECIPROCAL EXCHANGE.
   The City Collector may permit the proper officer, or his authorized
representative, of the United States or the state, or any political subdivision

741.27 UNLAWFUL RELEASE FOR TAX INFORMATION; PENALTIES.
   (a)    It shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the city to
release to any person any tax information obtained by virtue of a Reciprocal
Exchange of Tax Information Agreement between the State of West Virginia and
the City unless the person receiving the information is the authorized counsel
of the State of West Virginia or the City and shall be using the information
only for the purpose of administering business and occupation taxes or carrier
income taxes, or the person who filed the return has authorized, in writing its
release, thereby waiving his right to secrecy.

particular reports and the items thereof.

writing, of the deficiency in the tax. The taxpayer shall have ten days after
receipt of such notice within which to pay such deficiency. If the taxpayer
fails to pay such deficiency within ten days, the City Collector shall make an
assessment of such deficiency in accordance with this article and shall give
the taxpayer written notice thereof.
   (b)   If the taxpayer files a mathematically correct fourth quarter return
which reflects a balance due of the tax administered under this article; and if
full payment thereof has not been made, the City Collector shall notify the

(Ord. 2005-06-03. Passed 3-20-06.)
741.30 ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   (a)    If the City Collector believes that the tax imposed by this article
has been insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, because the taxpayer has failed
to properly remit the tax, has failed to make a return or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and
make an assessment therefore. Assessments shall be served upon the taxpayer

claimed, the City Collector may make service by first class mail and prepaid
postage.

collection of any tax which he is required to administer will be jeopardized by
delay, he shall thereupon make an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon
the assessment. The amount assessed will be immediately due and payable. Unless
the taxpayer against whom a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for
reassessment, within 20 days after service of notice of jeopardy assessment,
such assessment becomes final. Such petition for reassessment must be
accompanied by such securities as the City Collector deems necessary.
      (2)   Amended assessment. The City Collector may, at any time before the
assessment becomes final, amend, in whole or in part, any assessment whenever
he ascertains that such assessment is improper or incomplete in any material
respect.
      (3)   Supplemental assessment. The City Collector may at any time within
the period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental assessment whenever

City Collector a petition for reassessment in writing verified under oath by
the taxpayer or his duly authorized agent having knowledge of the facts,
setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected to,
together with the reasons for the objections; the assessment shall become final
and not subject to administrative or judicial review. The amount of an
assessment shall be due and payable on the day following the date upon which
the assessment becomes final.

which petition and notice shall be serviced upon or accepted by the City
Collector as an original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it
shall, with the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the office of the
clerk of the circuit court and docketed as other cases, with the taxpayer as
plaintiff and the City Collector as defendant. The filing of the appeal shall
not stay the collection of the tax. The collection of the tax shall be stayed
if the plaintiff shall file with such clerk a bond for the use of the
defendant, with sureties approved by the clerk, the penalty of the bond to be
not less than the total amount of the tax, interest and penalties (to such
date) appealed from, and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the
orders of the court; provided, that the judge of the circuit court may stay the
collection of the tax without the requirement of a bond, upon a proper showing
by the taxpayer that the properties of the taxpayer are sufficient to secure
performance of the court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served
thereby.
   (c)   The court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions
submitted to it on appeal from the determination of the City Collector. In such
appeal a certified copy of the City Collector's assessment shall be admissible
and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the provisions
of this article. The court shall render its decree thereon, and a certified
copy of the decree shall be filed by the clerk of the court with the City
Collector, who shall then correct the assessment in accordance with such
decree.
   (d)   Unless an appeal is taken pursuant to this section within thirty 30
days after service of the administrative decision, the City Collector's
decision shall become final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or
judicial review. The amount, if any, due the City under such decision shall be
due and payable on the day following the date upon which such decision becomes
final.

Collector may distrain upon and sell the real and personal property including
intangibles represented by negotiable evidence of indebtedness of the taxpayer,
for the payment of the amount of all taxes, penalty and interest accrued and

   (b)   If any taxpayer fails to make the return or any quarterly installment
required by this article, or make his return but fails to remit, in whole or in

unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of five percent of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of
delinquency, and one percent of the tax for each succeeding month, or fraction
thereof of delinquency provided, that if such failure is due to reasonable
cause, the City Collector may waive, with final approval from the City Manager,
in whole or in part, these penalties. Additionally, if the failure to pay is
due to fraud or intent to evade any such tax there shall be added an additional
penalty of 25 percent of the tax owed, exclusive of penalties.

"slug" as defined herein.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, from suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (e)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumbered in subsection (d) hereof, and which in the judgement
of the Board, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities,
processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the Board may:
         A.   Reject the wastes,
         B.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers,
         C.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/

be secured by first submitting application to the Town on form supplied by the
Board. All connections must comply with the requirements of this article and
with any other reasonable requirements which are necessary for engineering or
public health reasons.
   (c)   Street Sewer Extensions.  
      (1)   Applications. Where any individual or organization desires to
construct or have constructed, sanitary sewers beyond the present sewers, and
connect same to the Town sanitary sewer system, application for such
construction and connections must first be submitted to and approved by the
Sanitary Board. Application must be in the form of a letter outlining the
proposed project and accompanied by detailed plans and specifications, which
shall contain all information pertinent to the design and construction of the
proposed sanitary sewers. Two copies of such plans and specifications must be
submitted. Both copies thereof shall be approved by Board, one copy to be
returned to the applicant and the other copy to be filed in the office of the
Sanitary Board.
      (2)   Specifications. In general, the design and construction of all
sanitary sewers shall comply with sound recognized engineering practices and
sewer construction standards. The Board shall reserve the right to invoke any
requirements, which are deemed necessary for the protection, satisfactory
operation and future maintenance of the sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Pipe standards. All sanitary sewer lines serving more than two lots
shall have an inside diameter of at least six inches. Larger sizes may be
required where volume of sewage flow or possible future development indicates
they are needed. The sewer pipe shall be SDR 35 PVC or other acceptable and
approved material. No old or used sewer pipe shall be used for sanitary sewers.
      (4)   Joints. Joints shall be well caulked and oakum and then sealed.
Other types of joints will be considered for approval. Every joint, after being
made, shall be scraped on the inside before the next pipe is placed to insure a
perfect flow line.
      (5)   Lines; grades. All sewers shall be laid on straight lines and
uniform grades. Grades shall be such as to cause a minimum velocity in the
sewer of at least two feet per second when sewer is flowing half full. In
calculating minimum sewer grades, velocities and maximum capacities, Manning's
Formula with N - .013 shall be used.
      (6)   Manholes. Standard manholes shall be required at each change of
direction or grade, intersection with other sewers, or at least every 400 feet.
Manholes shall be constructed of pre-cast reinforced concrete sections. The
manholes shall have smooth, well-formed inverts, so as not to interfere with
the smooth flow of sewage through the bottom. The manholes shall have a minimum
diameter of four feet and, near the top, shall be tapered to a minimum diameter
of two feet. Construction of the manhole shall be such that a watertight
structure will result, and each manhole shall be equipped with cast iron steps
to provide reasonable access to the bottom. The manhole shall be topped with a
standard cast iron frame and cover.
      (7)   Trenches. Before any pipe is laid in a dry trench, the trench shall
be evenly graded with depressions being made for the bell end of the pipe, so
that the weight of the pipe will be evenly supported along its entire length.
After the pipe is laid and properly jointed, loose earth shall be carefully
tamped about the pipe and to a depth of at least six inches above the top of
the pipe, after which coarser materials may be backfilled. Where the bottom of
the trench has been filled in, the builder shall be required to thoroughly tamp
the area under the pipe. In wet soil or "quick sand" a rigid type of pipe, such
as cast iron, may be required in order to insure stability of the sewer line.
The need for a rigid type pipe shall decided by the Board's representative
inspecting the work.
      (8)   Infiltration. All pipe shall be laid and jointed so as to provide a
tight waterproof and root-resistant system. If it is deemed advisable by the
Board's representative, infiltration tests may be made upon the new sewer lines
before they are placed in service.
         Infiltration shall not exceed the following amounts:
 
            Allowable Infiltration in Gallons
Size of Pipe (inches)       Per Mile Per 24 Hours
    8             6,300
   12             9,500
   15             15,000
In the event that the measurements of infiltration exceed the allowable limits,
as stated in the above table, the applicant shall be required to repair the
defective joints or pipe to reduce the infiltration to the specified limits.
      (9)   Inspection; backfilling. The Sanitary Board shall have the right to
inspect all materials and work at any time during the progress of the job. No
sewer line or manhole excavations shall be backfilled without the prior
inspection and approval of the Board's representative.
      (10)   House laterals. All house lateral connections constructed as a
part of a new sewer extensions shall conform in every respect to the provisions
of this article regarding house lateral connections to the Town of Winfield
Sanitary Sewer System. Wherever a sewer line is to be constructed under a paved
street, or a street which is to be paved in the near future, house laterals
shall be constructed at the same time as the street sewer. These laterals shall
be extended to, or beyond the existing or proposed curb line of the pavement.
      (11)   Right of way. All sewer line extensions shall be made in
recognized street or alley rights-of-way or under rights-of-way especially
dedicated for sewer line construction. Where sewer lines are constructed in
rights-of-way other than streets or alleys, the builder of such sewer lines
shall furnish the Board with legal rights-of-way agreements conveying these
right-of-ways to the Town. The width of such rights of way shall be at least
five feet on either side of the centerline.
      (12)   Conveyance to Town. After satisfactory completion of the
construction of the sewer extensions, if then within the Town corporate limits
or upon the subdivision or development in which such sewer extensions have been
constructed being taken into the Town, the builder and/or owner of these sewer
extensions shall, by appropriated instrument, convey the ownership of these new
sewer lines and the necessary rights of way therefor, to the Town for future
maintenance and operation. Such sewers shall be subject to all rules and
regulations applicable to the Town Sanitary Sewer System, including the
obligation to pay the prevailing sewer service charges from the time the sewer
extensions are placed in service.
   (d)   Restroom and Toilet Facilities. Every building or other structure used
as a dwelling or within which persons are employed or congregate shall be
equipped with restroom or toilet facilities. No property owner shall construct
or maintain a building or other structure in which restrooms or toilet
facilities are required as herein set forth without such restrooms or toilet
facilities, and no such property owner shall maintain a building in which
restrooms or toilets are available without connecting the sewers from such
building to the public sewer as herein required.
   (e)   Leaking Sewers. No property owner shall permit the escape of sewage
from his property onto adjoining public or private property. Every such
property owner shall be responsible for maintaining the sewer line or lines run
from his property to the public sanitary sewer and shall promptly cause any
such line or lines to be replaced or repaired, should the same be broken or
leaking.
   (f)   Duty to Maintain Restroom or Toilet Facilities. Every property owner
shall maintain the restroom or toilet facilities within the building or
structure owned by him in good working order and, in the event the restroom or
toilet facilities become damaged, obstructed or useless, shall immediately
repair it.

that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been
approved by the Director.
         B.   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed stormwater
management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or
private that currently lack stormwater management facilities. This alternative
facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices and there
must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term operation and
maintenance of the off-site practice. The Director shall, to the maximum extent
practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site practice shall be
realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management practice.
         C.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City or

protection and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Director,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
      (6)   Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices. Where the Director
waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, and the
applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an
amount as determined by the Director. This amount shall be approximately equal
to the cost of stormwater management and based on the cubic feet of storage
required to stormwater management of the development in question. All of the
monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate stormwater capital
improvements program project, and shall be made by the applicant prior to the

application.
         (Ord. 2009-2010-03. Passed 12-8-09.)
1301.08 GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   In order to obtain approval of a subdivision the following procedure
shall be followed:
      (1)   The subdivider shall arrange a pre-application meeting with the
planning staff to discuss the proposed subdivision. The subdivider shall
provide a boundary survey map and a conceptual layout of the proposed streets,
lots, and utilities.
      (2)   After such meeting, and with the staff's suggestions being
incorporated in the proposal, the subdivider shall file the preliminary plat,
final plat or administrative subdivision application form and pre-application
filing fee (See Administrative Code Section
135.02).
      (3)   Upon receipt of a completed application form for a preliminary plat
or final plat, the planning staff shall schedule a Commission public hearing on
the application and publish a legal advertisement at least (30) days prior to
such hearing giving its date, place, and hour. (Note: The legal advertisement
is not required for an administrative subdivision).
      (4)   The planning staff shall send, by certified mail, a notice of the
hearing to the property owners who own property adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the list being submitted by the applicant. (Note: The mailing of
notices is not required for an administrative subdivision).
      (5)   The Commission shall conduct a public hearing giving an opportunity
for the applicant, persons in favor and persons in opposition to voice their
opinion about the application. (Note: The public hearing is not required for an
administrative subdivision).
      (6)   Upon completion of the public hearing, the Commission shall vote on
the application. (Note: The public hearing is not required for an
administrative subdivision).
      (7)   If the conceptual plan is approved, the subdivider will submit a
completed preliminary plat or final plat in accordance with the requirements of
Section
1305.
      (8)   Upon receipt of the preliminary or final plat, the planning staff
shall refer a copy to the town engineer for his review and report.
      (9)   If the plat is approved, the planning staff shall provide the
subdivider a copy of the plat signed by staff. If the plat is approved with
conditions, revisions or restrictions, the staff shall add, or have the
subdivider add, such conditions, revisions or restrictions to the plat prior to
signing it. If the plat is denied the staff shall provide the subdivider with a
copy of the plat with the denial and the reason(s) for the denial indicated
thereon.
      (10)   The planning staff shall retain a copy of the plat for the town's
records.
   (b)   All the above shall also apply to a final plat that has not been
previously approved as a preliminary plat by the Commission.
   NOTE: Once a preliminary plat has been approved, the subdivider may take
options on the new lots, but lots shall not be sold and deeds conveyed until
the final plat is approved. Building permits shall be obtained for all such
improvements prior to beginning construction.
   (c)   An administrative subdivision shall be referred to the Planning
Commission’s Engineer for review and report. The planning staff shall consider
such report. If the report is favorable, and there are no plat revisions
necessary, the planning director, or a duly authorized staff person, shall
approve the plan by signing it. If the report requires revisions, such
revisions must be made prior to signing the plat. The planning staff shall file
with the planning commission a report on administrative subdivisions they have
approved. This report shall be done at least quarterly, and may be mailed to
the commission with their monthly meeting packet.
   (d)   Within 30 days, the applicant shall file with the Putnam County
Clerk’s office four (4) copies of the final plat or administrative subdivision
plat. One (1) approved copy shall be returned to the Town of Winfield.
   (e)   If at any time during the application process, the applicant delays
more than six (6) months responding to any request, comment, or required step
the application and its process will be terminated. If the applicant wishes to

cause an undue hardship on the subdivider, or that due to particular
circumstances related to the subject subdivision a specific provision herein is
not practical or reasonable, or due to special conditions a provision herein
would be contrary to the public interest, the Commission may authorize a
modification or variance of the specific provision or requirement. The burden
of proof lies with the subdivider to convince the Commission of any of the
above in order to justify a modification or variance. Any modification or
variance authorized by the Commission and their justification finding shall be

is changed, off-street parking, loading spaces, and internal roadways shall be
provided according to the requirements set forth in this article.
      (1)   When several uses occupy a single structure or lot, the total
required parking shall be the sum of the requirements of the individual uses.
When there is a change in the use of a building or parcel of land, the
difference between the number of required parking spaces for the new use and
the number required for the previous legal use according to this article, even
if spaces were not available for the previous use, shall be provided.
      (2)   However, when the increased intensity or enlargement of a
commercial building requires two (2) or less new spaces, no additional parking
spaces shall be required.
   (c)   In all zoning districts, required off-street parking shall be located
on the premises intended to be served, unless a conditional permit for a
restricted accessory parking area is obtained from the Planning Commission in
accordance with appropriate district regulations and the provisions of Article

spaces in the front setback. Portions of the front setback are permitted to be
paved for vehicle or pedestrian ingress/egress only and in no case shall more
than 50 percent of the front setback be paved. When parking areas are provided
on a separate lot, the front setback requirements shall be determined as if
applied to a one- story structure within the zoning district where it is
located.
   
   (f)   A plan, drawn to scale, indicating how the off-street parking
requirements are to be met, shall accompany an application for a multi-family
and nonresidential building permit. The plan shall show all elements necessary
to indicate that the parking requirement is being fulfilled, and shall include
at least the following:

                                          A rule of thumb in determining the
                                          amount of space needed for loading is
                                          to double the length of the longest
                                          vehicle to use the space.

                                          circulation should take advantage of
                                          this.
                                          The layout of the site, including
                                          plans for future expansions, should
                                          enable all maneuvering to be done on
                                          site.

1373.01 STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the intent of the following provisions to:
   (a)   Control construction of structures on nonconforming lots
   (b)   Restrict expansion of nonconforming structures used for a permitted
use
   (c)   Encourage the eventual elimination of nonconforming nonresidential
uses
   (d)   Prevent the re-establishment of nonconforming uses after they are
moved or abandoned.
(Ord. 2005-06-02. Passed 3-20-06.)
1373.02 NONCONFORMING VACANT LOT.
   (a)   A single family dwelling may be constructed, only by special
permission of the Commission, on a pre-existing nonconforming lot of record,
and shall comply with all applicable setbacks. The Commission shall hold a
public hearing on such requests. The filing, notification, and public hearing
procedures are as provided in Section
1373.03 Filing Procedures. Exception to the approval requirements shall include
lots reviewed and approved by the Commission prior to the adoption of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Where such a lot does not meet the minimum frontage requirement but
does meet the minimum area requirement, the following setback requirements
shall apply:
      (1)   No required side setback shall be less than ten (10) percent of the
width of the lot. When there is more than one side setback, their sum shall be
not less than 25 percent of the width of the lot.
      (2)   No side setback shall be less than five (5) feet in any event
         (Ord. 2005-06-02. Passed 3-20-06.)
1373.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE USED FOR A PERMITTED USE.
   A lawfully existing structure, which contains a permitted use but does not
comply with the other requirements of this ordinance for the zoning district in
which it is located, may be continued but shall be subject to the regulations
below. In such cases, however, the failure to meet landscaping or screening
requirements shall not be considered a nonconformity.
   (a)   Enlargement, Repair, Alteration. A nonconforming structure may be
enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered, provided no such
enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration shall create any
additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity
of such structure.
   (b)   Reconstruction. In the event a nonconforming structure is destroyed by
fire, flood, or other natural cause, said structure may be rebuilt on the same
foundation with the previously existing setbacks, provided the reconstruction
of such structure is begun within 12 months of the date it was destroyed.
   (c)   Damage or Destruction. In the event a nonconforming structure is
intentionally damaged or destroyed by the owner of the property, to such an
extent that the cost of restoring it to its prior condition exceeds 50 percent
of the current replacement cost of the entire structure, exclusive of
foundations, such structure shall not be permitted to be restored unless it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this ordinance for the district
in which it is located.
   (d)   Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved, for any distance,
to any other location on the same or other lot, unless the structure shall
conform to the regulations of this ordinance for the district in which it is
located after being moved.
   (e)   One-for-One Replacement. An existing single-wide manufactured home
having a width of less than 20 feet may be replaced with a unit of the same
dimensions on the same lot. The intent of this regulation is to promote
affordable housing opportunities. Should the lot remain vacant for a period of
twelve (12) consecutive months, the lot must then conform to the regulations of
the zoning district.
(Ord. 2005-06-02. Passed 3-20-06.)
1373.04 NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURE OR LAND.
   A use of part or all of a structure, or land, which is not permitted under
the applicable district regulations of the Zoning Ordinance, but which is
lawfully established on the effective date of this ordinance, shall be termed a
"nonconforming use". Such use may be continued so long as otherwise lawful but
shall be subject to the regulations below.
   (a)   Enlargement.   No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, unless such
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of
the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which they are located. Moreover, on
any lot that is the site of a nonconforming use, no structure shall be
constructed, enlarged, or added to in any manner unless, after such
construction, enlargement, or addition, all structures and uses located on such
lot shall conform to the regulations of this ordinance for the district in
which they are located.
   (b)   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Ordinary maintenance and repairs, or
repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, shall
be permitted, provided such allowance shall not be deemed to authorize any
violation of the other parts of this section. Nothing in the Zoning Ordinance
shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of a structure, or restoring a
structure to a safe condition (except for a damaged or destroyed structure
subject to provisions of subsection (d) of this section) in accordance with the
order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety,
and who declares such structure to be unsafe, and orders its restoration to a
safe condition.
   (c)   Structural Alteration. No structural alteration shall be made unless
the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which they are located.
However, nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall be construed to prevent owners
of nonconforming residential structures those structural alterations that do
not increase the number of dwelling units within it or enlarge its exterior
dimension.
   (d)   Damage or Destruction.  In the event a structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means,
to such an extent that the cost of restoration to its prior condition exceeds
50 percent of the current replacement cost of the entire structure, exclusive
of foundations, such structure shall not be permitted unless a building permit
is obtained and restoration actually begun within one year of the date of such
partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. However, in a
residential zoning district, a nonconforming residential structure destroyed by
a natural disaster or fire, including a structure in an area which has been
down-zoned, may be replaced, provided the new structure does not contain more
bedrooms or dwelling units than the previous structure and provided the new
structure is in the process of reconstruction within twelve (12) months of the
date it was destroyed.
   (e)   Moving.  No nonconforming use of land or structure shall be moved, in
whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the
same or on any other lot, unless such use shall conform to the regulations of
this ordinance for the district in which it is located after being moved.
   (f)   Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include the following:
      (1)   Extension of a nonconforming use to any structure of land area
other than one occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance (or
on the effective date of a subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to
be nonconforming).
      (2)   Extension of a nonconforming use within a structure to any portion
of the floor area that was not occupied by such use on the effective date of
this ordinance (or on the effective date of an amendment thereto that causes
such use to become nonconforming), provided a nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any part of such structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed
or arranged for such use on said effective date.
   (g)   Change.  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other
than the same use or a use permitted by the Zoning Ordinance in the district in
which the land is located, or a use that is of less nonconformity in terms of
the type of intensity of use. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a
permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
   (h)   Discontinuance.  A nonconforming use, which is hereafter voluntarily
discontinued, and remains such for a continuous period of one year, shall not
thereafter be reestablished. Such location shall thereafter be occupied by a
use, which conforms to the regulations of this ordinance for the district in
which it is located.
   (i)   Nonconforming Accessory Use.  No nonconforming accessory use shall
continue after the principal use to which it is accessory has been destroyed,
moved, or abandoned.
   (j)   Avoidance of Undue Hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in the
Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building or development on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual building construction
has been carried on diligently. Where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
the work shall be carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined
as work done which is beyond the preparation stage and into that stage where
the changes or additions are made permanent.

   (a)   No commission, board, agency, officer, or employee of the Town shall
issue, grant, or approve any permit, license, certificate, or any other
authorization for any construction, reconstruction, alteration, enlargement, or
relocation of any building or structure, or for any use of land or building,
that would not be in compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   In administering the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the standard
rule of rounding numbers to the nearest whole shall apply. When the unit of
measurement results in a fraction less than one-half or less than .5, the
fraction shall be disregarded; fractions of one-half or more, or .5 or over,
shall require the addition of unit of measure.
(Ord. 2005-06-02. Passed 3-20-06.)
1375.03 ZONING REVIEWS.
   (a)   A zoning review must be performed by the staff prior to the issuance
of a building permit for construction of a new structure, enlargement of an
existing structure, sign, parking lot, or other physical improvement (Excluding
re-roofing, screening or enclosing existing porches, building a sidewalk or
patio, etc.). In order to perform the review it shall be the responsibility of

proposed improvement(s) with the applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
If the staff deems it necessary for clarification it may require that the
improvements be staked out on the property in order to complete their review.
This review shall be completed in a reasonable time frame.
   (c)   (1)   The staff may require submittal of a drainage plan where it
appears the proposed improvement may create a drainage problem.

excavation plan designed and certified by a soil engineer.
(Note: The "plans" and "designs" referred to above shall be the financial
responsibility of the person seeking to do, or have the work done)
   (d)   The issuance of a building permit based on the staff's approved site
plan shall not prevent the staff from thereafter requiring correction of errors
in said site plan, or from preventing operations from being carried on
thereunder when in violation of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   No approval by staff shall be construed to allow or permit the
violation of any other law or regulation of the Town.

insurance policies, mortgages, bank accounts, or charge accounts; or

director, member having a financial interest therein, or by which he is

damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
      (16)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for unknown factors that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights
of any given flood and floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at
stream crossings, and increased runoff from urbanization of the watershed.
Freeboard also tends to lower the cost of flood insurance.
      (17)   Highest Adjacent Grade (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface immediately adjacent to the development or structure foundation.
This is primarily used during insurance rating in approximated floodplains.
      (18)   Historic Structure:  Any structure that is:

         B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
         C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or,
         D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:

surveying as defined in WV State Code.
      (22)   Lowest Adjacent Grade (LAG): The lowest natural elevation of the
ground surface immediately adjacent to the proposed development or structure
foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is
located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood
elevation.
      (23)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant
materials as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area

registered or licensed as a Registered Professional Engineer by the West
Virginia state board of registration for professional engineers as required
under WV state code article 13 et seq.
      (32)   Remedy a Violation: To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with the requirements of this article, or, if full compliance is not
possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the non-compliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
      (33)   Reasonably Safe from Flooding: Means that during the base flood,
water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the
base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures.
      (34)   Special Flood Hazard Area: The land in the floodplain subject to a
one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps
that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (35)   Start of Construction: The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (36)   State Coordinating Office: The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (37)   Stream: As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,
whether natural or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of
their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless
of its volume.
      (38)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (40)   Substantial Improvement:  
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank:  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation: The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this article. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this article is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(Ord. 2011-12-7. Passed 1-10-12.)
1705.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the Town of Winfield which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the Town of Winfield by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 02/02/2012 or the most recent revision
thereof including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the Town of Winfield by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.   
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the Town of Winfield where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   A Town of Winfield's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the Town of Winfield shall notify the NFIP Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The Town of Winfield may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Town of Winfield. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail. Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this article if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either the closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance study,
or the reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the Town of
Winfield in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then be
required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of
this article.
         (Ord. 2011-12-7. Passed 1-10-12.)
1705.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the Town of Winfield during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
Town of Winfield, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine; 1. The amount being invested and, 2. The
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the Town of Winfield, The Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the Town of Winfield in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the Town of Winfield a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1705.08(e).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         (Ord. 2011-12-7. Passed 1-10-12.)
1705.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

Floodplain Administrator for review within five (5) business days of contract
signing. The Town of Winfield does not require and will not keep copies of the
contracts or addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this article.
(2)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information
shall also be included in the application for work within the Special flood
hazard area:
         A.   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
            1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
            3.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
            4.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
            5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic
elements of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical
construction, it is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by
obtaining elevation data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Licensed Professional Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a
mistake in elevation has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
            6.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with
permit conditions.
            7.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Town of Winfield determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall
state:
               a.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
               b.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1705.08(c).
         B.   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
      All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits;
certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor.
            3.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)B.1. above, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
               a.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               b.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
         C.   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant
materials used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant
Structures only)
            1.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
            2.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
               a.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               b.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  i.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
                  ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
                  iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
            3.    In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion
agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1705.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
         B.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
         E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 2011-12-7. Passed 1-10-12.)

West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and
10b as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4 or the most recent revisions
thereof. The anchoring shall be adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to the
over-the-top and frame ties, attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground
anchors may not be adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements.
This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.
         D.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and/or perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block shall have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and

been installed to the standards set forth in this article.
   (c)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) below, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the special flood hazard area or elevated to
two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         A.   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
         B.   Structures shall be no more than 200 square feet in size and
valued at less than $5,000.00.
         C.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         D.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         E.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         F.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2 shall be used in the portions of the structure below BFE.
         G.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         H.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (a) are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1705.08(c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill. The Town of Winfield officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1705.04(a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The Town of Winfield may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Town of Winfield During permit review the Town of
Winfield shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback. 
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area. (Ord. 2011-12-7. Passed 1-10-12.)

Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.

1705.08  APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this article, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Town Council of the Town of Winfield
which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be filed with the
Town Council of the Town of Winfield, in writing, within thirty (30) days after
notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Board
shall set a time and place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be
heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to
grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a
determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a Town of Winfield official that the issuance of a decision to
allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, such construction below the Base
Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notifications shall
be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in this section; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and report such decisions issued in
its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the Town of Winfield, shall
be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the Town of Winfield of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this article shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and
all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance with this article may be
